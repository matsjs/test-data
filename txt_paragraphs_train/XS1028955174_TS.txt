INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA We operate in certain segments of the building materials

<<<

 sector for which it is difficult to obtain precise industry and market information. Market data and certain economic and industry data and forecasts used, and statements regarding our position in the industry made, in this offering memorandum

<<<

 were estimated or derived based upon assumptions we deem reasonable, from internal estimates and surveys, market research, government and other publicly available information, reports prepared by consultants and independent industry publications

<<<

. These include information published by Euroconstruct as well as research performed exclusively for our Group. The information has been accurately reproduced and, as far as we are aware and have been able to ascertain from information published

<<<

 by those sources, no facts have been omitted which would render the reproduced information inaccurate or misleading. While we believe these statements to be reliable, they have not been independently verified, and we do not make any representation

<<<

 or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of such information set forth in this offering memorandum. Additionally, industry publications and such reports generally state that the information contained therein has been obtained from sources

<<<

 believed to be reliable, but that the accuracy and completeness of such information is not guaranteed and in some instances state that they do not assume liability for such information.
STONE QUARRY RESOURCES Information contained in this offering

<<<

 memorandum relating to estimates of our available stone quarry resources is based on internal geological data, as well as third-party analyses of such data, which we have reviewed. You should be aware that any discussion of our stone quarry

<<<

 resources in this offering memorandum is based on estimates of stone resources as at the reference dates stated in ``Business-- Divisions--Base Production--Raw materials-- Stone and quarries," and such estimates have not been updated for any

<<<

 extraction since such reference dates. Our stone quarry resources and resources data are not calculated or reported pursuant to or in accordance with the Australasian Joint Ore Reserves Committee Code (the "JORC Code"), and may also differ

<<<

 from those generally disclosed in filings with the SEC in accordance with SEC Industry Guide 7. There are no requirements under Finnish law relating to the classification or quantification of stone quarry resources. Estimates of our stone quarry

<<<

 resources depend significantly on the interpretation of geological data obtained from drill holes and other sampling techniques, which is extrapolated to produce estimates of the size, shape, depth and quality of mineral deposits. In addition

<<<

, the calculation of our available stone quarry resources is based on estimates and assumptions regarding a number of economic and technical factors, such as production rates, mineral quality, production and transportation costs and prices.

<<<

 These economic and technical estimates and assumptions may change in the future in ways that affect the quantity of our resources. We generate additional geological data as we quarry, which may not be consistent with the data on which our stone

<<<

 quarry resources estimates were based, resulting in changes to those estimates. No assurance can be given that the stone quarry resources presented in this offering memorandum will be recovered at the quality or yield presented. See "Risk factors

<<<

--Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry-- The stated stone resources included in this offering memorandum are estimates based on our, and a third party contractor's knowledge, experience and industry practice, and the volume and quality

<<<

 of our actual resources could be substantially lower than such estimates, and may also differ from those generally disclosed in filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in accordance with SEC Industry Guide 7. Our stated resources

<<<

 are not calculated or reported pursuant to or in accordance with the JORC Code."

<<<

 with International Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by the European Union ("IFRS"), and audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy, as set forth in their audit report included elsewhere herein. These consolidated financial statements have

<<<

 been prepared solely for inclusion in this offering memorandum in connection with the issuance of the Notes by the Issuer, and cannot be used for any other purpose. Due to the special purpose of these consolidated financial statements, no Board

<<<

Unless otherwise indicated, the financial

<<<

 information presented herein has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto of Paroc Group Oy as of and for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013 included elsewhere herein.

<<<


Historically, we have not been required under IFRS to present segment information in our audited consolidated financial statements. However, in connection with the Offering, we have adopted segment reporting going forward and therefore we have

<<<

 presented certain segment information herein for each of the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013.
For these purposes, our three segments under IFRS are:
 Insulation, which corresponds to our BI division and TI division;
 Panel System

<<<

, which corresponds to our PPS division; and
 Base Production, which corresponds to our Base Production division.
We also present in this offering memorandum certain eliminations and allocations, which provide for eliminations in respect of

<<<

 intercompany trading and other transactions between our operating divisions, as well as allocation of central overhead and management charges among our operating divisions, for purposes of Group consolidation.
For further information regarding

<<<

 our presentation of segment information, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Segment Reporting'' and our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum

<<<

.
This offering memorandum presents certain unaudited consolidated pro forma financial information adjusted to give pro forma effect to the Transactions. The unaudited pro forma financial information presented herein is based on available information

<<<

 and certain assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable and may differ materially from actual amounts. The unaudited consolidated pro forma financial information presented herein has been included for informational purposes only

<<<

, and does not purport to present what our results would actually have been had the Transactions occurred on January 1, 2013 for purposes of the pro forma statement of income information or on December 31, 2013 for purposes of the pro forma

<<<

 statement of financial position information, nor is it necessarily indicative of our results that may be achieved in the future. See ``Summary-- Summary Financial and Operating Information
Certain numerical figures set forth in this offering

<<<

 memorandum, including data presented in millions or thousands, as well as percentages, have been subject to rounding adjustments. Accordingly, the totals of certain data presented in this offering memorandum may vary slightly from the actual

<<<

 arithmetic totals of such data. Percentages and amounts reflecting changes over time periods relating to financial and other data set forth in ``Management's Discussion and Analysis o f Financial Condition and Results of Operations'' are calculated

<<<

 using the numerical data in the audited consolidated financial statements of Paroc Group Oy contained in this offering memorandum, as applicable, and not using the numerical data in the narrative description thereof.

In this offering memorandum

<<<

, unless otherwise indicated, all revenue, net sales and income data presented with respect to any particular operating division includes revenue, net sales and income of that operating division generated by internal sales to other operating

<<<

 divisions.
In this offering memorandum, unless otherwise indicated, all sales, total sales and total division sales represent net sales.
In this offering memorandum, unless otherwise indicated, energy cost has been presented excluding the cost

<<<

 of coke, which we instead present as part of raw materials cost.
We present our consolidated financial statements in euro. For certain information regarding rates of exchange between euro and U.S. dollars, see "Exchange Rate Information."
Non

<<<

-IFRS Measures
We include certain financial measures in this offering memorandum, including EBITDA, EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, as defined by us, which are supplemental measures of our performance and our ability

<<<

 to service our indebtedness that are not required by, recognized or presented in accordance with IFRS or U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We define these non-IFRS measures as follows:
 EBITDA: We define EBITDA as profit/(loss

<<<

) for the period from continuing operations before income tax expense, finance income and costs, depreciation and amortization and impairments;
 EBITDA margin: We define EBITDA margin as EBITDA for the applicable period divided by revenue for

<<<

 the same period;
 Adjusted EBITDA: We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA excluding items of a non-recurring or unusual nature, including in respect of our Russian expansion (including both our construction phase and our pre-commercial production

<<<

 phase), redundancies and restructuring, our transfer pricing case and the closure of our Lappeenranta site. See "Summary-- Summary Financial and Operating Information-- Summary Other Financial Information" for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA

<<<

 to EBITDA; and
 Adjusted EBITDA margin: We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA for the applicable period divided by revenue for the same period.
We present the non-IFRS measures described above in order to enhance the understanding

<<<

 of our financial performance and our ability to service our indebtedness, including the Notes. Although the non-IFRS measures described above are not necessarily measures of our ability to fund our cash needs, we understand that such non-IFRS

<<<

 measures are used by certain investors as measures of financial performance and to compare our performance with the performance of other companies that also report such non-IFRS measures. EBITDA, EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted

<<<

 EBITDA margin are not measurements determined in accordance with IFRS, are unaudited and should not be considered as alternatives to, or more meaningful than, (i) operating profit or profit for the period (as determined in accordance with IFRS

<<<

) as a measure of our operating performance, (ii) cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of our ability to meet our cash needs or (iii) any other measures of performance or liquidity under IFRS.
EBITDA, EBITDA

<<<

 margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for an

<<<

 analysis of our results as reported under IFRS. Some of these limitations are:
 they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;
 they do not reflect changes in, or cash

<<<

 requirements for, our working capital needs;
 they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary, to service interest or principal payments, on our debts;
 although depreciation and amortization are non

<<<

-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often need to be replaced in the future and such non-IFRS measures do not reflect any cash requirements that would be required for such replacements;
xi

 some of the exceptional

<<<

 items that we eliminate in calculating such non-IFRS measures reflect cash payments that were made, or will in the future be made; and
 the fact that other companies in our industry may calculate such non-IFRS measures differently than we

<<<

 do, which limits its usefulness as a comparative measure.
For a reconciliation of profit for the period from continuing operations to EBITDA for the periods presented herein, see ``Summary--Summary Financial and Operating Information--Summary

<<<

 Other Financial Information. '' The non-IFRS measures presented herein may be defined differently than the corresponding terms under the Indenture. Operating Data Except as otherwise indicated, in this offering memorandum the amounts or percentages

<<<

, as the case may be, of our production volumes, capacity utilization rates, the number of our employees and the proportion of fixed and variable costs in our business divisions or units are based on management estimates and are unaudited. Actual

<<<

 amounts and percentages may differ from the amounts and percentages presented based on such management estimates. Currency Presentation In this offering memorandum, all references to:  "Danish krone'' or ``DKK'' are to the Danish krone, the

<<<

 lawful currency of the Kingdom of Denmark;  "euro,'' "EUR'' and "'' are to the single currency of the member states of the European Union

SUMMARY
This summary highlights selected information contained elsewhere in this offering memorandum. This Summary is not complete and does not contain all the information that may be important to prospective investors. Prospective investors

<<<

 should carefully read this offering memorandum in its entirety, including the audited consolidated financial statements of Paroc Group Oy and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this offering memorandum, as well as the "Description of the

<<<

 Notes" and the other considerations that are important to their decision to invest in the Notes outlined under "Risk Factors."
Overview
We are a producer of premium stone wool insulation, and we believe that we are a market leader in Finland

<<<

, Sweden and the Baltic States by market share, which according to our estimates has remained stable overall over the past three years. Our other important markets include Norway, Denmark, Poland, Germany and the United Kingdom. Our stone wool

<<<

 products are used for both building insulation and technical insulation, and are known for their high product quality and superior fire resistance, as evidenced by customer and market surveys. We have significantly broadened our geographic

<<<

 sales reach since 2009 through the expansion and leveraging of our strategically located manufacturing network, allowing for an increasing sales presence in western Europe and Russia, which we view to be potential growth markets. As of March

<<<

 31, 2014, we operated nine production plants in five different countries with 13 Base production lines, 18 Technical Insulation production lines and one Panel System production line. As of the same date, we also had sales and representative

<<<

 offices in 14 European countries and sales to over 40 countries. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we generated total sales of 433.1 million (with Finland, Sweden and the Baltic States accounting for 20.2%, 25.1% and 8.6% of our total sales

<<<

, respectively) and Adjusted EBITDA of 82.8 million.
Our business is organized in four divisions:
 Building Insulation ("BI"). Our Building Insulation division markets and distributes a range of insulation productions and solutions for residential

<<<

 and commercial buildings in both new-build and renovation construction markets. Products in the BI division range from general building insulation to more specialized acoustic or fire protection insulation products. General building insulation

<<<

 is the largest business segment within BI. The majority of the BI division's stone wool products are manufactured by our Base Production division, with the exception of some more specialized acoustics and roofing products, which are produced

<<<

 by our Technical Insulation division. The BI division does not have its own production lines or manufacturing capacity. The BI division also sells panel wool internally to our Panel System division and sells insulation for pre-fabricated panels

<<<

 to third parties across Europe. For the year ended December 31, 2013, our Building Insulation division generated sales of 256.7 million (with external sales of 242.0 million, or 55.9% of our total sales).
 Technical Insulation ("TI"). Our

<<<

 Technical Insulation division produces high-quality stone wool products used in specialized industrial and technical applications. Because the TI division's products are tailored for specific customer applications, including meeting regulatory

<<<

 requirements, the TI division has its own manufacturing capacity. It uses stone wool from the Base Production division to produce more customized TI products through its own production lines and specialized machinery. There are 18 TI production

<<<

 lines at four plants. Products in the TI division are primarily used to provide insulation from heat, fire, condensation and sound, and are supplied to four key end-markets: heating, ventilation and air conditioning ("HV4C"), process industries

<<<

, marine and offshore and original equipment manufacturers ("OEM"). The TI division also sells specialized acoustics and roofing products to the BI division. For the year ended December 31, 2013, our Technical Insulation division generated sales

<<<

 of 150.9 million (with external sales of 133.5 million, or 30.8% of our total sales).
 Panel System ("PPS"). Our Panel System division manufactures sandwich facade panels--lightweight steel-faced panels with an insulating core of stone wool

<<<

. The main application of these panels are in the industrial and commercial construction of warehouses, municipal buildings and offices. The PPS division buys its stone wool from the BI division. For the year ended December 31, 2013, our Panel

<<<

 System division generated sales of 56.2 million (with external sales of 56.2 million, or 13.0% of our total sales).
 Base Production ("Base"). Our Base Production division is responsible for producing all of the stone wool for our BI, TI and

<<<

 PPS divisions, developing proprietary production technology and managing
1

capacity utilization across the Paroc Group. As of March 31, 2014, we operated eight production plants in five different countries with 13 Base production lines producing

<<<

 stone wool. Production sites are managed as a network with production costs allocated to the most cost-efficient plant, taking into account distribution costs. For the year ended December 31, 2013, our Base division generated sales of 207.

<<<

8 million (including internal sales of 207.3 million and external sales of 0.5 million). All of our internal sales are at a fixed cost agreed at the beginning of each year.
Our Strengths
We believe the following strengths have contributed to

<<<

 our success historically and are key factors in our efforts to deliver profitable future growth:
Market-leading positions in our home markets, underpinned by strength of brand and reputation for high product and service quality
We believe that

<<<

 we are a market leader based on market share in our home markets of Finland, Sweden and the Baltic States in both stone wool building insulation and stone wool technical insulation. We seek to differentiate ourselves from our competitors through

<<<

 our portfolio of high-quality stone wool products offered under our distinctive, widely-recognized brand, together with our ability to provide innovative, customer-specific solutions through our full-service sales and technical support offering

<<<

. Over our 75 years of operations, we have built strong, often long-term customer relationships, particularly with dealers (which comprise insulation wholesalers as well as DIY stores) in our home markets, which are the primary distribution

<<<

 channel for our building and technical insulation products. We believe that the superior quality of our products and services has reinforced the strength of our brand and resulted in a high degree of customer loyalty and retention.
Increasingly

<<<

 diversified business across geographies, end-markets and product mix
We sell our products through multiple sales channels in over 40 countries to various end-markets, which we believe reduces our dependency on any single market and positions

<<<

 us to capture additional opportunities to expand our business. Our largest markets are Finland and Sweden, which represented 20% and 25%, respectively, of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013, and no other country represented more

<<<

 than 10% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013. We have strong relationships with our customers and have multiple sales channels including dealers, construction contractors, industrial companies and equipment manufacturers (for

<<<

 example, prefabricated house and panel manufacturers, and specialist original equipment manufacturers).
We have also diversified our end-market footprint and product mix in recent years with the growth of our TI division, which now represents

<<<

 a significant part of our business, having reached external revenues of 133.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Our TI division displays a greater resilience and higher gross profit margins than our other divisions. This is primarily

<<<

 due to the fact that we sell our TI products to a more diversified set of end markets across Europe, as well as the higher value-added nature of our TI products, which typically require a greater degree of customization and additional manufacturing

<<<

 refinements to meet more specialized applications. Although our TI division relies to some extent on the residential and commercial construction sectors (primarily for the sale of HVAC products), we also supply our various TI products to diverse

<<<

 end markets, such as the oil and gas, petrochemical, power generation, pulp and paper, marine and offshore and OEM industries.
Given the growth of our TI business and the associated higher margins and broader set of end-market drivers compared

<<<

 to our other construction-focused divisions, we believe that the Group today has a more robust, resilient financial profile than in the past.
Established position through well-invested manufacturing base, branded products and strong customer

<<<

 relationships
We have a broad manufacturing base, consisting of nine production facilities in five countries. Our network of plants, located in Finland, Sweden, Lithuania, Poland and Russia, provides a stable platform to enable us to meet our

<<<

 high quality standards consistently across our markets and to supply products to our customers on a localized and cost-efficient basis, reducing transport costs, delivery times and import tariffs. Our proprietary technology, including our proprietary

<<<

 recipe and manufacturing process for the production of our stone wool products, also supports the manufacture of our high specification products. This allows us to produce a high-quality, differentiated product with strong brand value and corresponding

<<<


2

pricing. We have made significant investments to develop, and to continuously improve our facilities, as well as our product specifications and our manufacturing processes and technologies. We review our operations on an ongoing basis to

<<<

 ensure that our stone wool products meet the strict safety, environmental and efficacy standards in the markets in which we operate. We believe it would take considerable time and substantial investment to replicate our manufacturing base and

<<<

 product portfolio due to the proprietary technology, high levels of capital expenditure, regulatory requirements, maintenance costs, complex supply chain and strict quality standards needed to operate in the stone wool market.
We also benefit

<<<

 from the partial vertical integration of our supply chain and, for the year ended December 31, 2013, were able to supply approximately 30% of our raw stone needs through our ownership of rights or concessions to quarry stone from eight quarries

<<<

 in Finland. As a result, we have the ability to supply a majority of our requirements of certain stones that are difficult to source from third parties internally, leading to lower raw materials input costs (through a reduction in transportation

<<<

 logistics costs), assuring the quality of our stone wool products, and reducing our dependence on third-party suppliers.
In addition, we have strong, and often longstanding, customer relationships, as well as the brand awareness amongst dealers

<<<

 and contractors. Based on a recent customer differentiation survey conducted by BrandWorxx in 2013, over 90% of customers surveyed view Paroc as their preferred partner relative to competitors. The survey also highlighted Paroc as efficient

<<<

, reliable and innovative, as well as the most socially responsible provider. We believe that this brand recognition translates into strong customer loyalty.
Attractive financial profile with strong cash generation and flexible cost base
We

<<<

 have a strong financial track record with net sales of 404.8 million, 430.4 million and 433.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 3.4%. We have also demonstrated

<<<

 an ability to improve Adjusted EBITDA during periods of macroeconomic volatility, with Adjusted EBITDA of 61.2 million, 75.1 million and 82.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively, reflecting a compound

<<<

 annual growth rate of 15.8%.
While we have made significant strategic growth investment capital expenditures in each of the last three years (particularly in Russia), our maintenance capital expenditure requirements are relatively low and manageable

<<<

, with expenditures of 15.8 million, 10.3 million and 10.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively. This attractive capex profile, in combination with our continued focus on working capital optimization, has

<<<

 translated into a consistently positive cash conversion over the past three fiscal years.
We also have a flexible cost base with an ability to effectively increase and decrease the number of employees and number of shifts at our manufacturing

<<<

 plants depending on customer demand levels. For the year ended December 31, 2013, approximately 83% of our cost of sales was variable, comprising, among other things, raw materials cost, energy cost, direct production wages and distribution

<<<

 cost, which generally move in-line with changes in volume. Furthermore, our well-invested manufacturing platform and ability to increase capacity utilization provides operating leverage to drive potential profitability when volumes increase

<<<

.
Growth profile is well supported by insulation trends and favorable regulatory dynamics
We believe that our markets stand to benefit from a favorable regulatory environment in the medium-term, driven by a Europe-wide governmental commitment

<<<

 to improve energy efficiency standards and reduce energy consumption and costs, which should lead to an increase in the intensity of insulation use. In recent years there has been an increased political focus throughout the European Union on

<<<

 climate change, which, in combination with rising energy costs, has resulted in the implementation of tighter regulations concerning energy efficiency both at the EU and the individual country level. Current EU directives, for example, impose

<<<

 energy efficiency requirements on new and renovated buildings in connection with a targeted 20% reduction in energy consumption by 2020. Given that insulation can dramatically reduce heat loss and energy consumption in buildings and also has

<<<

 the added benefit of being one of the most cost-effective of all the available technologies to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, the implementation of more stringent energy efficiency requirements has affected demand for our products in our

<<<

 various geographic markets.
3

At the national level, individual countries put in place their own specific requirements from time to time that can drive market demand for insulation products. While the Nordic region has traditionally had relatively

<<<

 more comprehensive energy efficiency measures in place than our other focus markets, continued tightening of certain specific regulations (for example, the recent implementation in Finland and Sweden of new regulations requiring greater thicknesses

<<<

 for technical insulation) has recently fuelled demand for the higher margin, more specialized products offered by our Technical Insulation division. In addition, increased fire safety regulations in many of our markets (particularly in central

<<<

 Europe) in recent years has increased demand for our stone wool products, which are known for their superior fire resistance qualities compared with other insulation materials, particularly foam insulation.
Highly experienced and committed

<<<

 management team
Our experienced and committed management team led by Kari Lehtinen, our Chief Executive Officer, and Anders Dahlblom, our Chief Financial Officer, is a key factor in the continuing success of our business. Our management team

<<<

 has a strong background in manufacturing businesses, with an average of approximately 18 years of industry experience. Our management team has implemented a comprehensive business plan that we believe will allow us to protect our market share

<<<

 in our home markets and capture growth in our other focus markets. In addition, our management team includes a strong senior management team, with the division heads representing a combined total of 89 years' industry experience, with 61 years

<<<

 at Paroc Group.
Our Strategy
We believe we have a strong business platform across our established divisions. We will continue to leverage our strengths and drive improvements based on the following key strategies:
Maintain existing presence

<<<

 and grow market share in home markets, with continued innovation and expansion of our product and solution offering
In our home markets of Finland, Sweden and the Baltic States, our key priority is to maintain and protect what we believe are

<<<

 our existing market leadership positions through a continuing commitment to innovation, in particular through the creation and development of what we believe to be superior, premium insulation products.
We are highly motivated to improve and

<<<

 develop our product and service offering, as we pursue innovation through research and development projects. In our BI division, we intend to strengthen our product offering in the renovation and low lambda segments (where "lambda'' is a measure

<<<

 of the insulating capacity of a product for a given thickness, with lower values indicating a better insulating capacity). The renovation sector is attractive as it tends to be less vulnerable to market cyclicalities than the new build construction

<<<

 sector, and lower lambda products are appealing to customers because they provide the same level of insulation with a thinner insulation layer or provide a higher level of insulation with the same insulation thickness. In our TI division, we

<<<

 intend to focus on the development of new HVAC solutions, as well as oil & gas and marine product certifications, since product certifications are vital to our key TI end-market customers. Externally, we are focused on enhancing our existing

<<<

 products and developing new products to meet our customers' known and anticipated needs. Internally, we are focused on innovation across the organization, including integrating new technologies and adopting new methods of working with our customers

<<<

. We also intend to strengthen our dealer network to set ourselves apart as the supplier of choice in our other focus markets. In our PPS division, we intend to focus on value-add services to our products, utilizing our skilled staff to develop

<<<

 tailored solutions for our customers' projects, ensure smooth implementation of those projects and provide technical advice on the design and selection of structural solutions.
Grow our market share in other focus markets with existing proven

<<<

 products
In our BI division, our strategic priority is to secure a recognized market position, which we aim to achieve by growing faster than the underlying construction market with modest share gains, driven by strong brand positioning and

<<<

 an active sales strategy of dealer and contractor targeting.
In our TI division, our strategy is to strengthen our market positioning and grow market share in certain core end-markets, by leveraging our state-of-the-art technical insulation

<<<

 manufacturing capability at our Trzemeszno facility. This growth is expected to be led by our HVAC offering, and strengthening our dealer network will be highly important to achieving these strategic objectives. Outside of Europe, where we

<<<

 sell
4

technical insulation on a project basis, we intend to take a highly selective and opportunistic approach to project sales, with a focus on larger-scale industrial projects with higher value-added products.
In our PPS division, our

<<<

 strategy is to emphasize our panels' design and aesthetics, and the fact that our product offering includes the materials needed to complete a panel wall structure.
Focus on the growth potential in Russia and capitalize on our in-country manufacturing

<<<

 presence
Our recent investment in our new Tver manufacturing facility in Russia, which began meaningful commercial production in January 2014, has provided us with an in-country manufacturing presence and will enable us to serve the growing

<<<

 Russian market. Although we had previously sold our products in Russia through sales offices, developing an in-country manufacturing presence has reduced the transportation costs required to serve the market and has allowed us to avoid the

<<<

 significant tariffs on our imported products, which had previously limited the profitability of our Russian sales. We intend to use the quality of our product offering and our brand strength to modestly grow market share.
We anticipate that

<<<

 demand in the Russian market will support our new Tver manufacturing facility operating at high capacity utilization from the second year of its operation. Although no decision has yet been made, detailed plans are being considered for the

<<<

 addition of a second production line in Tver for the manufacture of base stone wool, as well as the addition of new machinery that would provide us with off line TI production capacity, which would double base production capacity in Russia

<<<

 and allow us to take advantage of growing Russian demand for technical insulation solutions.
Drive further efficiency and cost savings through operational excellence
We plan to improve efficiency and cost savings through a continued focus on

<<<

 research and development. We have implemented our ``Operational Excellence'' plan, which is a clear and detailed cost savings program through which we have delivered, and believe we will continue to deliver, significant savings. We anticipate

<<<

 that these savings will primarily come from our Base Production division, with one of the key sources of cost reduction expected to be energy efficiency measures applied throughout the production process. Through these initiatives, we believe

<<<

 we can manage our cost base more effectively and generate margin enhancement through operational leverage if we increase production over the medium term.

Recent Developments
Based on preliminary results, our revenue for the three-month period ended March 31, 2014 was 97.6 million, as compared to 95.6 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2013. This slight

<<<

 increase was driven primarily by growth in BI and TI net sales volumes, as well as improvements in product mix as a result of our continued focus on sales of higher margin, value-added HVAC products, partially offset by a decrease in net sales

<<<

 in our PPS division and foreign exchange translation losses. Our EBITDA for the three-month period ended March 31, 2014 was 11.2 million, as compared to 13.4 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2013. This decrease was primarily

<<<

 attributable to a significant increase in one-off costs incurred in connection with design and planning activities undertaken in connection with a feasibility study around a potential second phase of Russian expansion, start-up costs incurred

<<<

 at our new manufacturing facility in Tver and foreign exchange translation losses, which were partially offset by improvements in product mix, raw materials cost savings and savings on distribution costs realized as a result of our new local

<<<

 production operating model in Russia. Our cash flow from operations was also impacted by an increase in the change in operating net working capital, which increased from negative 3.9 million in the three-month period ended March 31, 2013 to

<<<

 negative 12.3 million in the three-month period ended March 31, 2014, primarily as a result of (i) higher trade receivables as of December 31, 2012 as compared to December 31, 2013, which were paid in the first quarter of 2013, and (ii) the

<<<

 introduction of our project to improve accounts payable in the first quarter of 2013, which had a positive impact on change in working capital, the effects of which were not as pronounced in the first quarter of 2014 with the project fully

<<<

 underway through the fourth quarter of 2013.

Intercreditor Agreement.....................

On or before the Issue Date, the Trustee, the Security Agent, and certain

 other parties will enter into an Intercreditor Agreement which will govern the relationships among the lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility, the holders of the Notes and the holders of certain other indebtedness (including hedging

<<<

 counterparties), the relative priorities of the secured creditors of the Issuer and its subsidiaries and certain other matters relating to the administration of security interests.

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the security interests

<<<

 securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be first-ranking security interests that will rank pari passu with the security interests that secure obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations. In addition

<<<

, the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will permit the incurrence of additional senior indebtedness or obligations that are permitted to be secured with security interests over the Collateral on a pari passu basis.

However, under the

<<<

 terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event of enforcement of the security granted over the Collateral, the lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging obligations will receive the proceeds from

<<<

 such enforcement in priority to the holders of the Notes. See "Description of Other Indebtedness--Intercreditor Agreement. "

 operations before income tax expense, finance income and costs, depreciation and amortization and impairments.
EBITDA is not a uniformly or legally defined financial measure and is not a measurement of performance under IFRS, and you should

 measure of our ability to meet our cash needs or (c) any other measures of performance or liquidity under IFRS. We believe that EBITDA is a useful indicator of our ability to incur and service our indebtedness and can assist investors to evaluate

RISK FACTORS
An investment in the Notes to be

<<<

 issued in the Offering involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the other information contained in this offering memorandum, you should carefully consider the following risk factors before purchasing the Notes. The risks and uncertainties

<<<

 we describe below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are not aware or that we currently believe are immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.

<<<

 I f any of the possible events described below occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. I f that happens, we may not be able to pay interest orprincipal on the Notes when

<<<

 due and you could lose all or part of your investment.
This offering memorandum also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward

<<<

-looking statements as a result of various factors, including the risks described below and elsewhere in this offering memorandum. See "Forward Looking Statements."
Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry
Difficult conditions in the general

<<<

 economy and the global financial markets may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and the majority of our sales are concentrated in limited number of markets.
Our results of operations are

<<<

 materially affected by conditions in the general economy and the global financial markets. Since 2008, the stress and disruptions experienced by global financial markets increasingly affected other sectors of the economy resulting in a global

<<<

 economic downturn. In particular, the construction industry in the markets in which we manufacture and sell certain of our products has been adversely affected by the global economic downturn. 2013 was characterized by heterogeneous volume

<<<

 development in our key building materials markets. While volumes in some countries, such as Finland, Sweden, Norway and Denmark, declined or remained stable, some markets, such as Poland, the Baltic States and Russia, experienced higher sales

<<<

 volumes than in 2012. Our Building Insulation division, which is our largest division by sales, is particularly dependent on developments in new residential construction activities that have historically and during the global financial and

<<<

 economic crisis been more susceptible to cyclicality than renovation, remodeling and modernization activities.
We currently operate plants in five countries and sell our products in more than 40 countries. However, a limited number of markets

<<<

 and regions account for the majority of our total sales. If our key geographic markets, in particular Finland (accounting for 20.2% of our sales for the year ended December 31, 2013), Sweden (accounting for 25.1% of our sales for the year ended

<<<

 December 31, 2013) and the Baltic States (accounting for 8.6% of our sales for the year ended December 31, 2013) were to experience a reoccurrence of the difficult economic conditions experienced in 2008-2010, or a material worsening of the

<<<

 current economic conditions, the level of construction activity may decline. This would likely result in reduced demand for our products and adversely affect our ability to pass on price increases to our customers to offset increased costs

<<<

, particularly in raw material and energy prices. Further, while the regions in which we operate have been affected differently by the global economic downturn, there can be no assurance that any weakening in economic growth will not affect

<<<

 the construction market globally or that negative economic conditions in one or more regions will not affect the construction markets in other regions. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially

<<<

 adversely affected by a continued or further downturn in construction activities on a global scale or in significant markets in which we operate.
The construction industry is cyclical in nature and subject to seasonality.
The building materials

<<<

 industry in any geographic market is dependent on the level of activity in the construction sector of that geographic market. The construction industry tends to be cyclical and is dependent on the level of construction-related expenditures

<<<

 in the residential, industrial and commercial sectors, public investments and public and private spending on infrastructure projects. The construction industry is particularly sensitive to factors such as GDP growth, interest rates and cost

<<<

 of mortgage financing for residential, commercial and industrial construction, inflation, consumer confidence as well as other macroeconomic factors. Political instability or changes in government policy may also negatively affect the construction

<<<

 industry, particularly those markets with higher exposure to civil engineering and infrastructure spending. Moreover, demand in the construction industry may be affected by demographic
24

trends, such as aging and declining populations in

<<<

 many mature markets and changes in the average number of persons living in one household or migration trends.
Moreover, the construction industry is dependent on weather conditions and is subject to seasonality. Lower demand for building materials

<<<

 occurs in periods of cold weather, and may be aggravated by particularly harsh weather conditions such as those experienced in the winter of 2012/2013. These effects and other unfavorable weather conditions, frequently lead to a volatile development

<<<

 of our quarterly financial results. Historically, sales in the second and third quarters have been significantly higher than in the other quarters of the year, particularly the first quarter. Results of a single fiscal quarter might therefore

<<<

 not be a reliable basis for the expectations of a full fiscal year and may not be comparable with the results in the other fiscal quarters. Seasonality effects may also increase our working capital requirements. Adverse weather conditions can

<<<

 materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations if they occur with unusual intensity, during abnormal periods, or last longer than usual in our major markets, especially during peak construction periods

<<<

.
We operate in competitive industries and our results may be adversely affected by competition.
Competition in the building materials industry, and more specifically, the markets for the products we produce and sell, is strong, has adversely

<<<

 affected our results in the past, and may adversely affect our results again in the future. Competition is based on many factors, including brand recognition and customer loyalty, product quality and reliability, breadth of product range, product

<<<

 design and innovation, manufacturing capabilities, distribution channels, scope and quality of services, and price. Additionally, we could face competition from parallel imports. Further, the markets for our products are characterized by many

<<<

 local and regional manufacturers and a number of major manufacturers with an international presence. Competitive dynamics are affected by the number of competitors in a certain market, their degree of vertical integration and pricing policies

<<<

, the development of demand and capacity as well as the access to and cost of raw materials and other inputs. Prices are subject to changes in response to relatively minor fluctuations in supply and demand, general economic conditions, and other

<<<

 market conditions beyond our control. In recent years, for example, a number of the competitors in our key Nordic building insulation markets have been engaged in intense price competition for market share partially in response to aggressive

<<<

 pricing by a new market entrant, and it is possible that we may in future be forced to reduce our prices in order to defend our market share. We have seen pricing pressure develop in certain other markets due to strong competition. Any significant

<<<

 decline in terms of volume, margin or price could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
In addition, the foregoing factors are often subject to varying developments in the regions and

<<<

 countries in which we operate. Individual regional and local competitive dynamics could in the future deteriorate and result in further significantly intensified competition in such regions or countries. For example, competitors may expand

<<<

 their capacities or enter or expand in markets in other regions or develop more innovative products, or other products may be preferred by consumers. The consequences of such changes or of other possible changes in the competitive environment

<<<

 could have material adverse effects on our competitive position, business, financial condition and results of operations. Competitors could also further improve the functionality or performance of their products and production processes leading

<<<

 to additional competitive pressure on prices for our products and services and potential decreases of sales volumes and market share.
In order to maintain or support our competitive position, we rely on continuous investments and innovations

<<<

 in product development, production processes, brands, services and distribution network. If we are less innovative than we historically have been, or less innovative than our competitors, we could lose customers and market share, and this could

<<<

 have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our divisions are active in industries that are capital intensive and require continuous capital expenditures in maintenance and optimization of

<<<

 our existing production facilities. Our competitors may have greater financial and personnel resources or know-how, may react more quickly to the changing needs and requirements of customers or better succeed in marketing their products than

<<<

 we do. Each of these factors could lead to a loss of market share and have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
25

Ourproducts compete with a variety ofdifferentproducts, many ofwhich we

<<<

 do notproduce and, as a result, we may lose market shares to such alternative products.
Our building insulation, technical insulation and sandwich panel products compete with several other types of insulation materials and facade panels that

<<<

 we do not produce. Other types of insulation materials (for example, glass wool, expanded polystyrene, extruded polystyrene and (particularly in our key Nordic BI and PPS markets) polyurethane products) and panels may be or may become more

<<<

 popular or may be perceived as having superior characteristics in terms of thermal insulation, load-bearing capacity, appearance, price, thickness or other respects. Given the similarities in properties, application and production, the main

<<<

 competitor to stone wool is glass wool, and there is a material area of overlap between mineral wool and foam insulation in external facades and roofs, as well as in sandwich panels, where mineral wool and foams are relatively more substitutable

<<<

. Although both glass wool and stone wool have advantages and disadvantages, low density glass wool insulation is easier to transport than stone wool due to better compressibility and is also cheaper to use in low density insulation products

<<<

 than stone wool. See "Business--Competition." The degree of substitution by other types of building materials may vary by region and from time to time and may also be attributed to local building and construction traditions, preferences and

<<<

 regulatory requirements. Substitute products may also gain market share through more effective advertising and marketing campaigns. If the environmental, fire protection, safety, energy or other characteristics of other products improve, or

<<<

 if substitute products' marketing campaigns are effective, any competitive advantage our building materials products enjoy may diminish. Additionally, we compete with alternative methods to increase energy efficiency such as, among others,

<<<

 replacement windows or doors and more efficient heating systems. Any significant replacement of any of our specific products by other types of products which we do not produce may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results

<<<

 of operations.
We are exposed to local business risks in many different countries.
Our growth strategy involves expanding outside of our core European markets, in particular into additional Central and eastern European countries, as well as

<<<

 Russia, and a significant portion of our current sales activities are conducted and located outside of our core markets of Finland, Sweden and the Baltic States. Further, we believe that sales generated outside of Finland, Sweden and the Baltic

<<<

 States in particular and, more generally, outside of the European Union, will increasingly account for a material portion of our total sales in the foreseeable future, which entails certain risks. These risks include, among other things:


<<<

 political instability, absence of sufficient protections for foreign investors and possible investment restrictions (including restrictions on assets belonging to certain investor groups);
 social instability, frequency of crimes and corrupt

<<<

 practices, and a lack of transparency on the part of governmental and political bodies;
 differing economic cycles and adverse economic conditions;
 disruption of our operations, e.g., by strikes or governmental action;
 unexpected changes

<<<

 in the regulatory environment;
 varying tax regimes, including with respect to the imposition of withholding taxes on remittances and other payments by our joint ventures or partnerships;
 fluctuations in currency exchange rates;
 inability

<<<

 to collect payments or seek recourse under or comply with ambiguous or vague commercial or other laws, and weak enforcement procedures for court judgments;
 changes in distribution and supply chains;
 varying degrees of concentration among

<<<

 suppliers and customers;
 insufficient protection against violations of our intellectual property rights;
 foreign exchange controls and restrictions on repatriation of funds; and
 difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified management

<<<

 and employees (including restrictions on employing foreign workers), or further rationalizing our work force.
Our expansion into markets outside of our core markets in Finland, Sweden and the Baltic States requires us to respond to rapid changes

<<<

 in market conditions in these countries. Our overall success as a global
26

business depends to a considerable extent on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage differing legal, political, social and regulatory requirements and economic

<<<

 conditions and unforeseeable developments. We may not continue to succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies which will be effective in each location where we do business and obtain raw materials from or may do so in the

<<<

 future.
We may not be able to successfully managefuture growth, including by way of organic growth to new regions and potential acquisitions which may expose us to additional risks.
Over the past decade, we have expanded our business primarily

<<<

 through organic growth, in particular in western, central and eastern Europe, the Baltic States and Russia, and we intend to continue our international expansion in all our divisions. In implementing this strategy, we are pursuing both organic

<<<

 growth and evaluating the market for potential acquisitions of insulation production facilities and other companies. Our growth has placed and will continue to place a strain on our management systems, infrastructure and resources. Our ability

<<<

 to manage this planned growth and integrate operations, technologies, products and personnel depends on our administrative, financial and operational controls, our ability to create the infrastructure necessary to exploit market opportunities

<<<

 for our products and our financial capabilities. We may also reach limits under applicable antitrust merger control laws if we attempt to further grow through acquisitions in certain markets. In order to compete effectively and to grow our

<<<

 business profitably, we will need to maintain our financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures, implement new systems as necessary, attract and retain adequate management personnel, and hire a qualified workforce that

<<<

 we can train and manage.
Our operations and expansion into Russia pose significant challenges as we attempt to successfully navigate operating in this new jurisdiction. We are aware of certain deficiencies related to the new Tver production

<<<

 facilities, as well as various regulatory, legal and other deficiencies in our operations in Russia, as described below. Although we believe that these are not unusual for a new business operating in Russia due to the regulatory structure and

<<<

 operational authorization process, we will need to rectify these deficiencies in order to ensure that our business operations are compliant with applicable laws. We commenced commercial operations and production at our new manufacturing facility

<<<

 in Tver in January 2014. As the facility is in its opening phase, with only limited operations underway, we are still in the process of obtaining certain necessary authorization documents. The process of obtaining these documents may take time

<<<

, and we may not be compliant with certain regulations during this initial period. For example, upon completion of a construction project some of our Russian production facilities may be classified as "dangerous industrial facilities", which

<<<

 will trigger the need for us to comply with specific industrial safety regulations. To date we have taken some, but not all, of the necessary steps to comply with these industrial safety regulations, but some time may pass before we become

<<<

 fully compliant. Moreover, some of our operations at Tver (specifically, our industrial gas consumption facilities) may be regarded as explosive dangerous industrial facilities and, if this is the case, we will need to obtain a relevant license

<<<

 in order to operate gas consumption facilities. We have commenced this process, but we only expect to receive the license towards the end of 2014, and there is no guarantee that we will receive the license. Certain administrative sanctions

<<<

 (including the temporary restriction of operations for up to 90 days) may be imposed on our operations in Russia if we fail to promptly complete all industrial safety and license compliance procedures. We additionally have some deficiencies

<<<

 in our title to real estate that will need to be corrected. There are also certain deficiencies in corporate formalities, charter capital and documentation that we need to address, as they could potentially result in compulsory liquidation

<<<

 of ZAO Paroc, our Russian subsidiary. However, once we have shareholder approval, we intend to convert ZAO Paroc from a closed joint-stock company to a limited liability company (or "OOO") later in 2014, which should address these corporate

<<<

 formality deficiencies. ZAO Paroc will have to notify its creditors of this reorganization process by publication of an official reorganization notice. Creditors whose claims have arisen before such publication will have the right to take legal

<<<

 action to accelerate their claims or demand early termination of the relevant agreements and compensation for associated losses incurred by them, provided that ZAO Paroc, its shareholder or any other third party does not provide sufficient

<<<

 security in respect of ZAO Paroc's liabilities to its creditors. However, we believe that in relation to the potential creditors of ZAO Paroc this risk is rather low, as most such potential creditors are either customers with whom we have contracts

<<<

 generally based on payment after delivery, or service providers whose rights should not be adversely affected by the reorganization and who we would not expect to wish to terminate their agreements with us. We also have what could be significant

<<<

 shortcomings in our intellectual property protection in Russia. See ``--Any threat to, or impairment of, our intellectual property rights could cause us to incur costs to defend those rights." If we are unable to successfully address these

<<<

 issues and put in place
27

measures to prevent similar problems in the future, our long-term plans for expansion in Russia could be compromised, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
Acquisitions pose additional risks, including

<<<

 that we may pay too much to acquire a business, assume contingent liabilities in connection with the acquisition, lose customers or employees following the acquisition and be unable to successfully integrate the acquired business with our existing

<<<

 business. Moreover, our plans to acquire additional businesses in the future are subject to the availability of suitable opportunities. Our competitors may also follow similar acquisition strategies and may have greater financial resources

<<<

 available for investments or may have the capacity to accept less favorable terms than we can accept which may prevent us from acquiring the businesses that we target and reduce the number of potential acquisition targets. Moreover, certain

<<<

 agreements concerning the acquisition of a number of shares in Paroc Polska sp. z o.o. might have been executed with certain legal deficiencies. Consequently, we cannot exclude the risk of such agreements being considered invalid.
If we establish

<<<

 new production plants as greenfield operations, significantly expand existing plants (such as the Tver production plant in Russia) or invest in or operate new businesses, we may initially incur start-up losses due to lower levels of capacity

<<<

 utilization and ramp-up and training cost and face additional challenges in entering or significantly increasing our exposure to new markets (such as Russia), including locating and securing suitable plant sites, understanding the dynamics

<<<

 and customer composition of new markets and translating our marketing and sales strategies to new markets. Start-up losses for production plants in new markets typically are incurred for the first five to seven years of operation.
Furthermore

<<<

, we expect that as we continue to introduce new products in our markets, we will be required to manage an increasing number of relationships with various customers and other third parties. The failure or delay of our management in responding

<<<

 to these challenges could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We operate in emerging markets such as Russia, which exposes us to risks inherent to such less developed markets, and we

<<<

 may be exposed to greater risks as we intend to increase our operations in such markets.
Some of the markets in which we operate and/or are considering entering or expanding our exposure, and in particular Russia, and from which we obtain raw

<<<

 materials for our products, are emerging markets in which the business climates expose us to greater political, economic, legal and social uncertainty than markets with more developed institutional structures, and the risk of loss resulting

<<<

 from changes in law, economic and social upheaval and other factors may be substantial. In many of these countries, the democratic tradition is less established and the rule of law less developed. Accordingly, our business is and may increasingly

<<<

 be subject to risks resulting from differing legal, political, social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions and unforeseeable developments in a variety of jurisdictions, including in emerging markets. In these markets we are exposed

<<<

 to an increased degree of risks arising from interruption of operations due to political or social instability and the establishment or enforcement of foreign exchange restrictions, which could effectively prevent us from repatriating profits

<<<

, liquidating assets or withdrawing from one or more of these markets. Recent political instability in Ukraine could impact our supply of coke; although we have not been impacted thus far, there is no guarantee that we will not be impacted in

<<<

 the future. See "-- Our business may be negatively affected by volatility in raw and other material prices, our inability to retain or replace our key suppliers, unexpected supply shortages and disruptions of the supply chain.' The imposition

<<<

 of economic or other sanctions upon countries in which we operate may also adversely affect our ability to do business in such countries, either by preventing us from doing business, or by lowering economic growth, in such countries. For the

<<<

 year ended December 31, 2013, Russia accounted for 8.3% of our revenues, and on March 6, 2014, the United States imposed sanctions on specific Russian and Ukrainian individuals deemed responsible for undermining the Ukrainian government, sovereignty

<<<

 and territorial integrity in the context of Russian actions in Crimea. On March 17, 2014, the European Union imposed sanctions (including travel restrictions and an asset freeze) against similar individuals and other persons and entities associated

<<<

 with them, while the U.S. expanded the scope of its sanctions to Russian officials (entities operating in the Russian arms sector and individuals who allegedly provide material support to senior officials, in the Russian government). On March

<<<

 20, 2014, the United States expanded the reach of sanctions to additional officials and one Russian bank, and left open the possibility that more extensive sanctions (for example, against core sectors of the Russian economy) could be imposed

<<<

. Most recently, on April 28, 2014, citing a failure by Russia to comply with its agreement to assist in resolving the political crisis in Ukraine, the United States imposed additional sanctions on Russian individuals and entities, as well as

<<<

 acted to freeze certain exports of military technology to Russia. On April 29, 2014, the European Union expanded the reach of sanctions to additional individuals.
28

Although we do not believe at this time that these sanctions will directly

<<<

 affect our Russian business, such sanctions could become more far-reaching, potentially covering imports to Russia, exports from Russia, or restrictions on doing business in Russia, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our

<<<

 Russian business operations, and our business as a whole. For example, as a result of the situation in Crimea, certain credit ratings agencies have revised their outlook for Russia from stable to negative, and there have been signs of adverse

<<<

 effects on the Russian economy, for example volatility and an overall decline in the Russian rouble against other currencies and declines in the Russian stock market. Moreover, we cannot exclude the possibility that Russian authorities may

<<<

 adopt certain measures in response to the sanctions imposed by foreign states, which may be primarily aimed at restricting foreign investments and foreign business in Russia, and which could materially and adversely affect our business, particularly

<<<

 in Russia. Further instability in or arising from Ukraine or the region could materially adversely affect our business in Russia, including due to increased volatility in currency exchange rates in the region, lower economic growth in the region

<<<

 or an increased risk of default by contractual counterparties with exposure to the region (such as our current supplier of coke from Ukraine and suppliers and customers in Russia).
Additionally, our business and corporate governance practices

<<<

 may place us at a disadvantage when competing with local companies in emerging markets, as such companies may gain a competitive advantage by implementing corrupt or `shadow' schemes, including cash tax evasion schemes, use of sham firms, and

<<<

 grey salaries and imports.
Interruptions in operations at our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
We operate a total of nine production plants in five countries

<<<

 plus additional industrial facilities, such as stone quarries, landfill sites and storage sites, and our results of operations are dependent on the continued operation of our production facilities and the ability to complete special customer

<<<

 order projects on schedule. Our production processes and technologies are complex as they need to be adapted to variations in the properties of certain raw materials and use combustibles and other dangerous materials, such as coke and chemical

<<<

 binding agents. Significant interruptions in operations at our production plants or other facilities, for example, due to explosions, fires, environmental incidents or other accidents, or to routine or extraordinary state audits or changes

<<<

 in regulatory requirements, may significantly reduce the productivity and profitability of a particular production or other facility, or our business as a whole, during and after such interruptions, including as a result of necessary repairs

<<<

 or upgrades to or replacements of damaged equipment or facilities, investigations or proceedings by governmental or regulatory bodies, and compensation claims brought by injured persons. Although we hold several types of insurance policies

<<<

 (including insurance against fire and business interruptions), our insurance coverage may be inadequate. Furthermore, our insurance coverage may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms and our insurance carriers may not

<<<

 have sufficient funds to cover all potential claims.
Additionally, three of our production facilities, including the Lappeenranta, Skvde and Vilnius facilities, are situated on land that we lease from third parties. It is possible that such

<<<

 third parties may elect to terminate or not to renew such leases, as has occurred with the Lappeenranta facility. See ``-- The closure of the Lappeenranta facility may result in greater costs or disruptions to our business than currently expected

<<<

." In particular, the lease relating to our Skvde facility can be terminated at the end of its initial three-year term (May 31, 2017) by either party, and unless terminated, the agreement will continue for successive periods of three years

<<<

. If a third-party lessor were to terminate or decline to renew a lease in respect of land on which one of our facilities is located, this may result in significant interruptions to our manufacturing operations, significant and temporary or

<<<

 permanent reductions in our overall production capacity, a material impact on our ability to serve customers in the regions in which we currently operate, and/or the incurrence of significant expenditures associated with the cessation or relocation

<<<

 of operations at the relevant facility. For further detail regarding the costs related to the closure of Lappeenranta. See ``-- The closure of the Lappeenranta facility may result in greater costs or disruptions to our business than currently

<<<

 expected." This may in turn significantly reduce the productivity and profitability of our business as a whole, both during and after any such shutdown or relocation process.
Similarly, the operation of our facility in Trzemeszno is dependent

<<<

 upon arrangements with the owners or users of certain adjacent real properties, particularly regarding certain easements and infrastructure necessary for the operation of our facility. Some of the formal documentation governing such arrangements

<<<

 may have expired or may not be complete or sufficiently comprehensive. We are negotiating, or are about to start the negotiation of, appropriate agreements in order to rectify this. However, there is no guarantee that we will ultimately reach

<<<

 satisfactory agreements with such third parties or that the terms
29

of such agreements will be on substantially the same terms as the arrangements currently in place. We may also be required to pay to such third parties amounts relating

<<<

 to our use or access to such easements and infrastructure, or arising from the inability of such third parties to use or access such easements and infrastructure. If no agreement is reached with such third parties, we may be required to temporarily

<<<

 or permanently discontinue our operations in Trzemeszno, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
The closure of the Lappeenranta facility may result in greater costs

<<<

 or disruptions to our business than currently expected.
Nordkalk, the owner of the land on which our Lappeenranta facility is situated (and a former affiliate when both companies were part of Partek), has informed us that it does not intend

<<<

 to renew our lease of that land upon its expiration in 2019. We have therefore decided to end our production on the site by the end of 2016. We have commenced the relocation process in respect of our operations at that facility and are in the

<<<

 process of reallocating production to our other facilities. See "Business--Divisions--Production facilities and inter-segment sales--Lappeenranta closure." Although we currently estimate that the total cost of the transfer process will be approximately

<<<

 7 million in capital expenditures and 1.3 million in operational expenses, and have recognized a provision of 6.9 million as of December 31, 2013 for demolition and other closure costs relating to this facility (reflecting the net present value

<<<

 of the 9 million in expected future demolition, land clearing and remediation costs), it is possible that the relocation process may not proceed according to plan and that expenses in excess of these estimates may be incurred. We also may incur

<<<

 significant additional remedial or other closure costs in connection with site investigations that are expected to be required, including if any impacts from historical operations are identified. The transfer process may also result in significant

<<<

 disruptions to our production operations and impair our ability to service our customers. We estimate that there will also be productivity, labor efficiency and other incremental costs that are expected to be spread over the duration of the

<<<

 transfer period, with a greater proportion incurred at the beginning of the transfer period. Additionally, there is a risk that the production equipment may be damaged during the transfer process, and it could be costly to repair or replace

<<<

 the equipment. These costs may underestimate the actual productivity and efficiency losses associated with the closure of the plant. This may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of our operations

<<<

.
Our business may be negatively affected by volatility in raw and other material prices, our inability to retain or replace our key suppliers, unexpected supply shortages and disruptions of the supply chain.
The cost and availability of raw

<<<

 material and other supplies are critical to our operations. Our profit margins are largely a function of the relationship between the prices that we are able to charge for our products and the cost of the raw materials and other inputs we require

<<<

 to produce these products. The raw materials and other inputs we depend on include chemical binding agents, stone raw materials, coke, electricity, natural gas, steel, coatings, wired net and packaging materials. For the year ended December

<<<

 31, 2013, the cost of these raw materials and other inputs (excluding energy cost) amounted to a total of 85.5 million, or 19.7%, of our sales. The prices of the raw materials that we use generally tend to be cyclical and highly volatile. The

<<<

 availability and prices of raw materials and other supplies are influenced by factors that we cannot control, such as market conditions, general global economic prospects, production capacity in the relevant markets, production constraints

<<<

 on the part of our suppliers, infrastructure failures, regulations, political instability that reduces production, including carbon dioxide emission regulations applicable to our suppliers and the amounts of emission allowances available to

<<<

 them, export restrictions, such as the export restriction on coke that were imposed by the Chinese government (lifted in January 2013), demand from other users of such raw materials (such as steel manufacturers, in the case of coke), foreign

<<<

 exchange rates and other factors. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we supplied approximately 30% of the total raw stone material that our operations required from quarries over which we have mining rights, which meant that we needed to

<<<

 source the majority of our total raw stone requirements from third parties. Although the underlying prices for stone have been relatively stable over the past five years, we have experienced volatility in connection with related inbound transport

<<<

 logistic costs, which are sensitive to the distance of delivery and oil price movements. One of our outside sources of stone is a quarry set to close in 2015; although we have alternative sources for this stone, it is possible that upon such

<<<

 as a closure in the future, replacement raw materials will be more difficult to source, or if the new source is located at a greater distance, transport costs could increase significantly.
30

We plan to purchase approximately 50% of our anticipated

<<<

 coke needs for 2014 from suppliers in Ukraine, and all of our coke supplies for our Russian business are supplied by Ukrainian sources. Our main source of Ukrainian coke is in Kharkov in the eastern region of Ukraine, where there has been continuing

<<<

 political instability. Continuing instability could threaten our supplies of Ukrainian coke, which could adversely affect our business. Although we have put in place contingency plans for the supply of coke from the Czech Republic and Poland

<<<

, there is no guarantee that these contingency plans will be as cost-effective as our current supplies, and if there is an escalation of instability in the region, that substitute coke will be able to reach our production plant in Russia. The

<<<

 coke we require for our plants must meet certain characteristics, and it is possible that we could have difficulty in sourcing the correct type of coke, even from these alternative suppliers. We are also investigating Ukrainian sources for

<<<

 raw stone material, which could be affected by the current instability. Our plants use natural gas sourced from Russia, and such supply could be affected by the current instability in the region. See "-- We operate in emerging markets such

<<<

 as Russia, which exposes us to risks inherent to such less developed markets, and we may be exposed to greater risks as we intend to increase our operations in such markets.''
In order to manage the risk of fluctuations in raw material and

<<<

 energy prices, we enter into supply agreements covering significant portions of our expected raw material and energy requirements for set periods of time, which may be on a monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual basis depending on the nature

<<<

 of the supply agreement. If raw material or energy prices decline after we have entered into the relevant supply agreement, we may have to pay prices under the agreement which are in excess of prevailing spot market prices, which may adversely

<<<

 impact our results of operations.
Furthermore, interruptions of our operations resulting from supply shortages of certain raw materials or other inputs can significantly affect our profitability. If any of our suppliers is subject to a major

<<<

 disruption in its production or is unable to meet its obligations under our existing supply agreements, we may be forced to pay higher prices to obtain the necessary raw and other materials from other sources. We purchase certain raw materials

<<<

, such as coke and binder, from a limited number of suppliers, and although they are presently widely available, we may not in future be able to find acceptable alternative sources or adapt our production processes sufficiently to differing

<<<

 qualities of raw materials and the process of locating and securing such alternative sources might be disruptive to our business. In particular, switching binder suppliers would require extensive testing. Any extended unavailability of a necessary

<<<

 raw material or other input could cause us to cease manufacturing one or more of our products for a certain period of time.
While we attempt to match price increases of raw materials and other inputs with corresponding product price increases

<<<

, and historically we have been able to do so with an approximately six-month time lapse, our ability to pass on increases in the cost of raw materials to our customers is, to a large extent, dependent upon our contractual relationships and

<<<

 market conditions, and we may not be able to raise product prices immediately or at all, and we may not succeed in passing on the entire cost increase to our customers. Our ability to pass on price increases of raw materials and other inputs

<<<

 may also be affected by a temporary decline in demand for our products in the markets in which we are active and increased price competition for market share. A significant proportion of sales of our products are made to dealers. Many of our

<<<

 dealer customers, particularly larger dealer chains, have purchasing relationships with one or more of our competitors and may possess significant pricing power. While our top 10 customers for each of our Building Insulation, Technical Insulation

<<<

 and PPS divisions represented, respectively, only 31%, 37% and 19% of total gross external sales for the year ended December 31, 2013, and the vast majority of sales made by our Russian business unit are to dealers, the purchasing power of

<<<

 large dealers may nonetheless impair our ability to pass on increases in the cost of raw materials. Purchase cooperation and a tendency toward dealer consolidation may also limit our ability to pass on increases in the cost of raw materials

<<<

. Any inability or delay in passing on increases in raw materials cost to our customers could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flow.
Significantfluctuations in demand or a decrease

<<<

 or increase ofproduction capacities might lead to overcapacity or undercapacity, either of which could adversely affect our business.
Our customer agreements generally do not require customers to purchase defined volumes during their term.

<<<

 This means that there is no guarantee that future cash flow and revenues from such agreements will correspond to historic levels. A significant decrease in demand, such as due to a cyclical weakness of the construction industry, and delays

<<<

 in the capacity adjustment process may result in overcapacity and a reduction in the utilization rates of our plants in the respective geographic regions. Decreases in demand and increases in production capacity that result in overcapacity

<<<

 may also lead to increased price
31

competition. Should we in such a situation not succeed in reducing overcapacity at reasonable cost, for example by temporary or permanent plant closures, thereby lowering our cost base and helping to minimize

<<<

 the excess supply, we may face a further decline in profitability, cash flows and results of operations. Even if we successfully reduce our capacity, such reduction may lead to significant extraordinary cost, particularly in connection with

<<<

 plant closures, termination of employees or other restructuring measures. In addition, the pricing and production policies of competitors are unpredictable and could frustrate our efforts. Moreover, declining prices in a market situation with

<<<

 significant oversupply may also affect neighboring regions, thereby causing further declines in sales, cash flows and results of operations. There is also a risk that we could establish or acquire additional production capacities which cannot

<<<

 be appropriately used, for example as a result of an inaccurate evaluation of market developments. Any failure to adequately utilize our production capacities could lead to impairment on production equipment and significant impairment charges

<<<

 on goodwill and have negative consequences for our profitability due to our relatively high level of fixed cost. If one or more of the aforementioned risks materializes, this could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition

<<<

 and results of operations.
Alternatively, a significant increase in demand, or decrease in production capacity, may result in our production becoming capacity-constrained. If demand for our products increases beyond the maximum production capacity

<<<

 of our existing production plants, our ability to satisfy customer orders in a timely manner may be adversely affected, which may result in declines in customer satisfaction, reputational damage and lost sales. The number of production shifts

<<<

 can range between three and five (representing shifts working 24 hours a day, seven days a week), although running five production shifts is illegal in Finland and in Russia. However, in Finland and Sweden, increasing the number of shifts from

<<<

 three to four roughly increases our salary costs by 8%, and our salary costs would be increased by roughly 25% if shifts increase from three to five, due to Sunday compensation regulated by law and our collective bargaining agreements, thereby

<<<

 increasing the marginal cost of ramping up production. We may also need to notify our Russian employees of introduction of shifts in advance and obtain their consent. Failure to meet these requirements may impair our ability to meet the increased

<<<

 demand in production. We may also be required to make substantial capital expenditures in order to augment our production capabilities to meet such increased demand by expanding existing production plants or developing new production plants

<<<

, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. See "-- We may not be able to successfully manage future growth, including by way of organic growth to new regions and potential acquisitions

<<<

 which may expose us to additional risks."
Our licenses, permits and certifications may be suspended, amended or terminatedprior to the end oftheir terms or may not be renewed.
Our licenses, permits and certifications required to conduct our

<<<

 business operations (or certain parts thereof), including for the exploration, development and exploitation of mineral resources, operation of our manufacturing facilities, and sale of our products for use in specific applications (particularly

<<<

 the products produced by our Technical Insulation division), could be revoked, withdrawn, invalidated or amended by the relevant authorities under certain circumstances. For example, a license, permit or certification could be revoked, withdrawn

<<<

, amended or refused to be renewed if there is a breach of a permit condition or collateral clause, a subsequent change of facts or a relevant regulation, if a permit is found to be contrary to the public interest, if it is deemed necessary

<<<

 to prevent severe harm to the common good, or if we fail to satisfy the criteria for its continuation or renewal. Licenses or permits which have been granted for existing operations may also be required to be reviewed regularly by the permit

<<<

 authorities. As a consequence of such reviews, the relevant license or permit conditions may be updated in accordance with current standards, which may be more rigorous or onerous than those applicable at the time the relevant license or permit

<<<

 was initially granted or last renewed. In particular, the Finnish environmental permit system does not recognize the grandfathering of existing permit conditions into renewed permits. Due to production caps in our environmental permits we might

<<<

 also be required to renew our permits if our business expands and requires larger production capacities. Our existing permits might therefore be amended to include more stringent threshold, which may have a significant adverse effect our operations

<<<

. See ``Regulation--Finland--Emissions and Environmental Permits" for further details.
Some of our TI products, namely those with marine applications and fire protection applications for ventilation ducts, require certifications before they

<<<

 can be sold for use in certain specific applications. We estimate that approximately 30% of our sales in the TI division come from sales of products for which a certification is required. While we do not foresee a risk that our products will

<<<

 not be properly certified, certification requirements change, and there is a possibility that we may need to make adjustments to our products to comply with amended requirements, which could prove costly.
32

There is a potential risk of certain

<<<

 permits relating to our production facilities at Trzemeszno being declared invalid in the future due to formal irregularities in their issuance. There is no guarantee that we would be able to procure their reissue in such circumstances. Additionally

<<<

, fines may be imposed by the relevant Polish authorities if the relevant facilities are used without valid permits. Payment of benefits under insurance policies relating to those facilities may also be refused due to our potential failure to

<<<

 hold the required permits.
Moreover, in some jurisdictions and in respect of some of the licenses and permits we require, private individuals and the public have the right to comment upon the process, raise objections to proposed permits and

<<<

 initiate court proceedings to intervene and prevent the granting of requested permits. In addition, environmental organizations, residents or other third parties may raise objections to our current or proposed activities or file suits challenging

<<<

 our operations and the granting or existence of permits and licenses to conduct our operations. However, permits must be granted to us if the legal requirements for such permits are met, regardless of possible complaints and appeals. The administrative

<<<

 permit procedure might, however, be delayed for several years due to appeals.
If any of our licenses, permits or certifications is appealed, revoked, withdrawn or amended, or if we have difficulty renewing a license, permit or certification

<<<

, we may experience delays in our operations which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In some circumstances the Finnish environmental permitting regime permits the commencement of

<<<

 projects notwithstanding pending appeals, but this does not apply to all projects. In addition, the right to commence such a project may be cancelled or limited by appeal courts.
The licensing, permitting and certification rules, particularly

<<<

 in emerging markets such as Russia, are complex, sometimes contradictory, and may change over time, making our ability to comply with all applicable requirements more difficult or even impossible, thereby precluding continuing or future operations

<<<

. For instance, the construction or renovation of buildings in Russia requires a significant number of varied governmental approvals, including positive conclusions of state environmental expertise processes, project documentation approvals

<<<

 and ultimate construction permits issued by regional or local authorities. Moreover, due to its location construction of the Tver production plant requires additional consents from the administration of the Zavidovo national park. See "--We

<<<

 are subject to numerous environmental, building, health and safety regulations, technical standards and other regulations". If the construction of the Tver production plant fails to conform to the project documentation, construction is commenced

<<<

 without an appropriate construction permit or otherwise fails to comply with regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines and penalties, as well as cancellation of the project by government officials or even demolition of the building

<<<

 already constructed. Regulatory authorities, particularly in Russia, exercise considerable discretion in matters of enforcement and interpretation of applicable laws, regulations and standards, the procedure, timing and scope of issuance and

<<<

 renewal of licenses, permits, approvals and authorizations, and in monitoring licensees' compliance with the terms thereof. Russian authorities have the right to, and frequently do, conduct inspections of the operations and properties of license

<<<

 and permit holders. Any such future inspections may result in a determination that ZAO Paroc has violated laws, decrees or regulations, and ZAO Paroc may be unable to refute such a determination or remedy the alleged violations. ZAO Paroc's

<<<

 failure to comply with existing laws and regulations, the terms and conditions of its licenses and permits, or the findings of governmental inspections may result in the imposition of fines and penalties or more severe sanctions, including

<<<

 the suspension, amendment or termination of licenses, permits, approvals and authorizations, ZAO Paroc being required to cease certain business activities, or the imposition of criminal or administrative penalties on ZAO Paroc's officers. The

<<<

 introduction of public consultation as a part of permitting procedures in most of the jurisdictions in which we operate has in many cases extended the processing times for license and permit applications, and increases unpredictability in the

<<<

 permitting process. Requirements imposed by these authorities may be costly and time consuming and may result in delays in the commencement or continuation of exploration, production, sales or distribution operations.
We also may incur penalties

<<<

 and other costs, sanctions and obligations as a result of permit violations. There have also been certain compliance issues with environmental permit stipulations within the Finnish mining sector during the last two years. This has led to an

<<<

 intensive discussion concerning the supervision of permit compliance. The Finnish Ministry of the Environment amended its environmental permit supervision guidance document in late 2013 and has established new positions within the state environmental

<<<

 administration in order to support environmental permit supervision. This may have an impact on the degree of scrutiny and likelihood of authorities imposing more stringent permit requirements (for example, in connection with reviews of environmental

<<<

 permits) and may thus affect our
33

operations. Moreover, environmental protection legislation reform is currently being progressed by the Finnish Parliament, which will implement the EU Industrial Emissions Directive ("IED"). The Polish

<<<

 Parliament is also currently working on legislation implementing the IED into the Polish Environmental Protection Law; under this implementing legislation, IPPC permits (so-called integrated permits) should be reviewed by competent authorities

<<<

 within three months from the date when such legislation enters into force, in order to adapt such permits to the standards laid down in the IED. The implementation of the IED in the EU Member States in which we have production facilities will

<<<

 have an impact on all Paroc operations, excluding quarrying, and will likely require capital expenditure in respect of baseline environmental studies of our facilities with environmental permits. As the IED is implemented in the other jurisdictions

<<<

 in which we operate, we also anticipate additional capital expenditure in respect of baseline environmental studies from facilities with permits. See ``Regulation."
Furthermore, we are required to obtain licenses or permits for quarrying of

<<<

 specific mineral deposits. In Finland these are known as `mining districts' granted pursuant to `mining district decisions', where granted in response to applications filed prior to July 1, 2011; they are known as `mining permits' otherwise

<<<

. See "Regulation--Finland--Excavation of Stone Resources" for further details. We currently hold eight mining districts in Finland: Joutsenenlampi, Lehlampi, Ybbersns, Sallittu, Vanhasuo, Metssianniemi, Ntrml and Kangas. We own the two

<<<

 real property sites included in the Joutsenenlampi mining district, pay a leasing fee for the land on which the Sallittu and the Kangas districts are located, and for the other five quarries, we do not lease the land, but pay the statutory

<<<

 mining excavation fee. Under the Finnish mining legislation, in order to exploit our quarries we (as the mining district holder) are also required to secure surface rights to the relevant real property from the relevant landowners either by

<<<

 private agreement, or through the exercise of statutory appropriation rights conferred by mining district decisions or permits. We are responsible for paying annual compensation in the form of an excavation fee to the owners of land included

<<<

 in the mining district. The basis for determining the annual excavation fee varies by mining district, but is generally based on contracts with the land owner and a statutory excavation fee based on the Finnish mining legislation. A mining

<<<

 district decision could be revoked if we fail to comply with the legal requirements applicable to such mining districts decisions or we do not actively carry out mining for a period of over five years (or such further period as may be specified

<<<

 in response to an extension application by us, though during such extended period we are required to pay a higher extraction fee to the relevant landowner). Because mining at the Kangas and Ntrml sites (we currently hold these sites as

<<<

 reserves) has been suspended for a number of years, we run the risk that the exclusive rights we obtained to exploit stone resources at these sites will be revoked. We have already been granted an extension to begin mining at Kangas until December

<<<

 3, 2015. If our right to quarry is revoked, we will no longer have access to the reserves at these sites, which could materially adversely affect our supply of stone and therefore results of operations. After the closure of the Lappeenranta

<<<

 facility, we will likely hold the Vanhasuo mining district as a reserve site and will not conduct active quarrying operations.
We also need to obtain environmental permits which cover each of our operations. These environmental permits are

<<<

 reviewed at regular intervals determined by the relevant environmental permitting authority. We currently hold valid environmental permits for our production sites in Finland (Lappeenranta, Oulu and Parainen) and for the Joutsenenlampi, Lehlampi

<<<

, Vanhasuo, Ybbersnas, Sallittu and Metsasianniemi districts, however, we do not have valid environmental permits for the Kangas or Natramala districts. Environmental permits are needed before commercial exploitation of these rights may

<<<

 commence. The Oulu, Hssleholm and Vilnius environmental permits will need to be renewed by December 31, 2014, we are applying for new environmental permits at the Lappeenranta plant (by October 2015) and landfill (by May 2015) and the environmental

<<<

 permits at Joutsenenlampi, Sallittu and Ybbersns each have an authority audit due by December 31, 2017. We are also required to have chemical safety permits for each of our operations. Although we have a good historical record of obtaining

<<<

 such mining districts and environmental permits in Finland, we may not be able to obtain such specific permits in the future, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Increased

<<<

 energy cost or disruptions in energy supplies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our business is dependent on the steady supply of significant amounts of energy, in the form

<<<

 of coke and electricity, at commercially reasonable terms. In particular, the stone wool production process relies on substantial amounts of energy to melt the stone raw materials and other materials used in the production process. In our manufacturing

<<<

 facilities this is done in a cupola oven fired by coke or in an electric melting furnace (in two of our facilities). Our energy cost, which therefore mainly consists of cost for the supply of
34

coke and electricity incurred in connection

<<<

 with the production of our products, accounts for a high percentage of our cost base. We also consume natural gas, propane and biogas and burning oil. Gas is used primarily as fuel in the curing process to polymerize binder. Gas is also used

<<<

 to pre-heat combustion air in the melting process. In the year ended December 31, 2013, our energy cost (excluding coke) amounted to a total of 27.5 million, or 6.3% of our sales. Energy cost is affected by various factors, including the availability

<<<

 of supplies of particular sources of energy, energy prices and regulatory decisions. We have also experienced significant volatility with respect to coke prices in recent years. Coke prices spiked in 2011 with an approximately 28% increase

<<<

 in price over the previous year, but over the course of 2012 and 2013 prices have declined significantly. For example, coke average consumption prices have ranged between approximately 234 and 506 per tonne since 2007. Negotiated prices are

<<<

 generally based on trends in Australian coking coal prices. Such volatility may increase as a result of natural disasters (for example floods in Queensland, Australia, which is an important region in the global supply of coking coal, increased

<<<

 the global price of coking coal), current political instability, such as the unrest currently occurring in several countries in the Middle East, North Africa and eastern Europe, the promoted growth of renewable energy sources, especially in

<<<

 Europe, or the imposition of regulations such as export restrictions or government excises on coke or coking coal. Any significant increase in market prices, transportation cost, grid fees or taxes (including reduction of tax benefits) associated

<<<

 with the supply of energy would increase our operating cost and, thus, may negatively affect our results of operations if we are not able to pass the increased cost fully and without delay on to our customers. Our ability to pass on energy

<<<

 price increases may also be affected by a decline in demand for our products in the markets in which we are active and increased price competition for market share. Any inability or delay in passing on increases in energy cost to our customers

<<<

 or any interruption or shortage of energy supply may negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
In addition, in March 2014 the Finnish government reached an agreement on central government spending limits

<<<

 for 2015-2018. The Finnish government has decided to increase energy taxation in respect of the mining industry. It is anticipated that the electricity tax rate (currently at 0.703 c/hWh (VAT 0%)) applicable to companies operating in the mining

<<<

 industry will be increased, and mines will be excluded from the scope of accompanying energy tax cuts to support companies operating in energy-intensive industries. The Finnish government may yet change its position and no precise information

<<<

 is available at the moment. However, if enacted these changes may increase the energy taxes paid by the mining industry in the forthcoming years. Because we operate quarries, all or part of our operations may be subject to any increased tax

<<<

 rate applicable to the mining industry, and we may not receive all or any of the benefit of the accompanying reductions in the energy tax applicable to companies operating in energy-intensive industries. Any increase in our effective tax rate

<<<

 may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
The availability of and any significant increase in the cost of transportation represent a significant risk for our business.
Transportation plays

<<<

 an important part in our supply chain as we ship our products, mainly by truck and to a lesser extent by rail or ship, to our customers. Further, most of the raw materials need to be transported to our production facilities. Any material disruption

<<<

 in or lack of availability of transportation, inadequacy of transport infrastructure (particularly in Russia), or significant increases in fuel or energy prices, road tolls or demand-driven market prices resulting in higher transportation cost

<<<

, could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, increased costs relating to exhaust emissions control requirements that have been or may be imposed in the future, particularly

<<<

 due to climate change-related legislation, may also lead to such effects. Additionally, it is possible that legislation (both at the EU and national level) will change regarding truck size, axis weight and truck length, or that regulations

<<<

 may introduce or raise fuel content or economy standards, which could potentially increase transportation costs. For example, over the past decade in certain jurisdictions in which we operate, national legislation on such issues has changed

<<<

 in response to EU legislation and domestic political concerns, which has in certain cases, such as the introduction of a new heavy vehicle tolling system in Poland in 2011, resulted in higher transportation costs. In the year ended December

<<<

 31, 2013, our transportation cost, which include freight for deliveries from our plants or other stocks to customers, customs tariffs and clearance, as well as intra-group transfers of finished products but excluding transportation cost arising

<<<

 from purchases of raw materials and other inputs, amounted to a total of 44.7 million, or 10.3%, of our sales.
35

We generally rely upon third-party service providers for the transportation of our products to customers. Our ability to service

<<<

 our customers at commercially reasonable cost depends, in many cases, upon our ability to negotiate commercially reasonable terms with carriers, including railroads and trucking and shipping companies. To the extent that third-party carriers

<<<

 increase their rates, including to reflect higher labor, maintenance, fuel or other cost they may incur, we may be forced to pay such increased rates sooner than we are able to pass on such increases to our customers, if at all. Any material

<<<

 increases in our transportation cost that we are unable to pass on to customers fully and in a timely manner could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.
Any threat to, or impairment of, our

<<<

 intellectual property rights could cause us to incur cost to defend these rights.
Protection of intellectual property is essential in the context of maintaining and developing Paroc proprietary technology. We currently own 332 registered trademarks

<<<

 and 513 registered patents (and patent applications) worldwide. These protections may not adequately safeguard our intellectual property and we may incur significant cost to defend our intellectual property rights, which may adversely affect

<<<

 our results of operations. There is a risk that third parties, including our current competitors, will infringe on our intellectual property rights, in which case we would have to defend these rights. We have in the past (some licensing agreements

<<<

 are still in place) licensed our proprietary technology to third parties, including to some of our competitors, which carries with it the risk that our intellectual property may be misused or used in ways contrary to the licensing agreements

<<<

. There is also a risk that third parties, including our current competitors, will claim that our products infringe on their intellectual property rights. These third parties may bring infringement claims against us or our customers. Additionally

<<<

, any of our intellectual property may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented by third parties, which could limit our ability to prevent competitors from marketing related or competing products. Any such actions by third parties may adversely

<<<

 affect our results of operations, our customer relationships and our reputation.
Although we are not aware of any major legal proceedings that have been brought against us for infringement of a patent or trademark or of any proceedings brought

<<<

 against any of our patents that could have a material adverse effect on our business if we would not prevail in such proceedings, we cannot exclude the possibility that such a claim could be brought against us in the future. We do, from time

<<<

 to time, face incidents of infringement of our intellectual property, and currently there are two companies which may be infringing upon our patented technology, and we are in the process of evaluating the proper course of action. We have recently

<<<

 settled a dispute with another company over the other company's use of red and white stripes. The Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market recently denied our application for a Community Trademark for our red and white stripes, ruling

<<<

 that the trademark is instead protected by local regulations. If not enough is done in these cases to protect our proprietary technology or other intellectual property, there is a risk that our proprietary technology or other intellectual property

<<<

 will become widely available and could be used by our competitors, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
Our expansion into the Russian market has brought with it certain challenges with respect to intellectual property. There

<<<

 are certain shortcomings in our intellectual property protection in Russia that we will need to address in order to properly protect our intellectual property. Although the process of addressing these shortcomings is ongoing, there is no guarantee

<<<

 that we are able to rectify all of the shortcomings before irrecoverable damage is done to our intellectual property protection in Russia. For example, certain Paroc Group patents and trademarks used in Russia have not been properly licensed

<<<

 to our Russian subsidiary and it may be difficult to prove the actual use of these patents and trademarks in order to protect them from being contested in Russia on the basis of non-use. Furthermore, to date we have not definitively confirmed

<<<

 whether or not the products that we sell in Russia infringe any third-party patents, and we cannot guarantee that there are no third-party patents that might hinder our Russian operations. Moreover, we do not currently employ all available

<<<

 means to prevent the parallel importation of our products into Russia, such as registration of our trademarks with the Russian Customs Register of Intellectual Property Rights and registration of our trademarks in other countries of the Customs

<<<

 Union of Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan. Moreover, there is a risk that certain of our products are not adequately protected by our trademarks in Russia. Our existing internal procedures in Russia do not provide a sufficient level of protection

<<<

 for business secrets, and so there is a risk that they may be disclosed to our competitors in circumstances where we are unable to recover damages or obtain injunctive relief in respect of such disclosure. There is also some evidence that there

<<<

 are imitators using the Paroc name in Russia. If we are not able to resolve these issues, or we incur significant costs in doing so, this may adversely affect our results of operations.
36

We rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality

<<<

 agreements with our employees and contractors for the protection of our products, technologies, recipes and other material know-how. If we are not able to maintain sufficient secrecy, this could have a material adverse effect on our results

<<<

 of operations andfinancial condition.
While we own a significant number of patents and trademarks, in certain circumstances we protect our technology and know-how as trade secrets. We principally rely on trade secrets instead of other forms

<<<

 of protection either because patent or trademark protection is not possible, for example the particular technology could not be exactly identified which was used or would not qualify for patent or trademark protection, or in our opinion would

<<<

 be less effective than maintaining secrecy. In addition, we rely upon confidentiality agreements with our employees and contractors. To the extent that we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements, there can be no assurance

<<<

 that our efforts to maintain secrecy will be successful or that third parties will not be able to develop the product, technology or know-how independently. Any loss of secrecy could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations

<<<

 and our financial condition.
The quality of our stone wool products depends upon our ability to successfully exploit existing resources of stone raw materials that are difficult to source from third parties and acquire and develop further stone

<<<

 raw material resources at competitive costs. Delay orfailure in acquiring, developing and completing developmentprojects could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
The quality of

<<<

 our stone wool products depends on our ability to quarry certain stones that are difficult to source from third parties cost-effectively and to meet the quality standards required by our manufacturing facilities. Although we can supply stones

<<<

 that are difficult to source from third parties over the medium- to long-term based on current production levels, in the future our resources may not be available when required or, if available, may not be capable of being quarried cost-effectively

<<<

 or possess appropriate qualities. Additionally, we may not be able to accurately assess the geological characteristics of any resources that we acquire, and the acquisition of an inferior grade of resources may materially and adversely affect

<<<

 our profitability and financial condition.
Although we believe that there are local substitutes for one type of stone that is difficult to source from third parties and there are other substitutes, such as slag, for another type of stone, substitution

<<<

 would likely increase costs as we transport the first type of stone over longer distances to our production plants, and as we test the replacements for the second type of stone. As the chemical composition of the second type of stone is uniquely

<<<

 suited to our stone wool products, sourcing slag with the correct composition may be a costly process, and it is possible that the products produced with the substitute will not be of the same quality as those made with the virgin stone we

<<<

 currently source from the quarries over which we have mining rights. We estimate that it would cost approximately 50,000 per plant in research and development and other costs to implement the use of slag instead of this stone across all our

<<<

 production facilities. This estimated cost does not include possible losses in productivity or higher scrapping costs.
The hydrological and geological structure of the quarry can affect the ease and volume of quarrying as well as the speed

<<<

 of overburden removal. Additionally, our operations require the quality monitoring and removal of groundwater during quarrying. Future efforts to remove groundwater may not be adequate and may not meet future operational demands or expectations

<<<

. In addition, quarrying involves hazardous activities, such as operating large pieces of rotating and other heavy equipment. It is possible that the equipment may be subject to corrosion due to weather exposure, and preventing such corrosion

<<<

 may require additional costs. All of these factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
We currently hold both Kangas and Natramala mining districts in reserve and no mining has been

<<<

 carried out in those areas for a number of years. If mining is ceased for a period of five years the Finnish Mining Authority (TUKES, the Chemical Safety Agency) may rescind the mining district decisions. Prior to this, we may apply for an

<<<

 extension to this five-year limit in order to avoid losing the mining district. The Mining Authority may grant extensions up to a period of 10 years. We are in the process of applying for an extension for the Natramala mining district, and

<<<

 have an extension for the Kangas mining district. However, during this time we must pay a higher land area based extraction fee to landowners (normally 50 per hectare; higher fee 100 per hectare). Once we commence quarrying, we will also be

<<<

 required to pay, in addition to the normal 50 per hectare land area-based extraction fee, a fee which is based on the amount of quarried minerals in accordance with the Finnish Mining Act. A byproduct fee may also be required if byproducts

<<<

 are sold for use outside the mining operations. The Mining Authority has not initiated any proceedings so far. However, if such proceedings are initiated and the mining districts are
37

revoked, there may be material adverse effects on our

<<<

 profitability. Furthermore, if we are required to start quarrying in these mining districts in order to avoid losing them, we may incur additional costs.
Our stone resource estimates are based on current production needs. If we increase production

<<<

, this could cause our stone resources to be depleted earlier. The success of our plans to extend the life of our quarries depends on, among other factors, our ability to expand existing quarrying areas and to make new quarrying areas accessible

<<<

. This may require extensive and costly infrastructure measures such as the relocation of industrial facilities or residential communities and may lead to compensation obligations. In addition to general quarrying permit requirements, relocation

<<<

 measures may require administrative or judicial proceedings or other legal procedures to enforce the relocation, particularly if agreement on relocation is not reached with affected parties. With such proceedings we risk an unfavorable decision

<<<

 that may delay, complicate or impede projects to expand existing or develop new quarries. Moreover, increasing attention on the environmental impacts of quarrying may have an impact on future permitting procedures and cause delays in initiating

<<<

 new production. If we cannot expand existing or acquire new quarries and make them accessible to increase our stone resources, this may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our quarries will

<<<

 require additional capital expenditures in the future in order to fully exploit these resources as projected. In addition, since we attempt, where practical, to quarry our lowest-cost resources first, we may not be able to quarry all of our

<<<

 reserves at a cost similar to our current operations.
Because our stone resources deplete as we extract stone, our ability to sustain or increase our current level of production in the long term depends, in part, upon our ability to acquire

<<<

 and develop additional stone resources that are economically recoverable and to develop new, and expand existing, quarrying operations. We applied for, and on July 24, 2013 and January 15, 2014 (respectively) received, mining district decisions

<<<

 for the Teerisuo and Longanlampi concession areas. We believe these mining district decisions are legally valid. These decisions have been delivered to the National Land Survey of Finland and we are currently awaiting the commencement of the

<<<

 requisite land surveys to define the boundaries of the respective concession areas. We have yet to complete the process of securing the necessary surface rights to the respective areas (either by entering into private agreements with the relevant

<<<

 landowners, or exercising the statutory expropriation rights conferred by the mining district decisions). We currently expect these surveys to be completed, and the surface rights to be acquired, during 2014. This will increase our resources

<<<

 of the stones that are difficult to source from third parties. However, there is no guarantee that those surface rights will be obtained (though in certain circumstances the land surveying process permits a mining district holder to access

<<<

 expropriated areas notwithstanding unresolved appeals by landowners regarding compensation amounts), and it is possible that the land surveys may uncover issues that could potentially delay the finalization of our rights in relation to the

<<<

 respective areas. Moreover, our planned expansion projects might not result in additional stone resources, and we might not have continuing success developing additional quarries due to the aforementioned reasons. Furthermore, the quality of

<<<

 stone and quarrying conditions in new or expanded quarries is uncertain and may be less favorable than those at which we are currently quarrying. In addition, these expansion projects could be limited by many factors, including our ability

<<<

 to raise sufficient financing, investment restrictions under our existing or future debt agreements and the inability to expand onto properties on commercially reasonable terms. Furthermore, expansion of existing quarries requires significant

<<<

 economic, political, public and infrastructure development efforts and investments, particularly if there is a need to relocate existing residents. Recent reforms of Finnish mining legislation have made the expropriation of properties within

<<<

 a proposed mining area more difficult, particularly in cases of low-value or short-term deposits. Prior to those reforms, obtaining a mining district decision automatically gave grounds for expropriation. For mining permit applications filed

<<<

 after July, 2011, obtaining an expropriation permit requires that the construction of the mine be in the public interest, and that the benefits of the project outweigh the detriments. The previous provisions relating to expropriations will

<<<

 continue to apply to mining district decisions granted in response to applications filed prior to July 1, 2011. Although our Teerisuo and Longanlampi applications were filed before the reforms became effective, the new rules may affect future

<<<

 applications for mining permits. The occurrence of any of the aforesaid risks could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Additional factors affecting our ability to successfully

<<<

 exploit stone resources, particularly in new areas of our quarries, include the ability to acquire new land, gather geological data, obtain reserve assessments, acquire approvals, consents, licenses and permits from the relevant authorities

<<<

, work with environmental groups, work with unions, secure the availability, terms, conditions and timing of acceptable arrangements for quarrying, ensure successful transportation and construction and the performance of engineering and
38


<<<


construction contractors and secure the services of contractors, suppliers and consultants. Exploitation permits or quarrying rights that have already been granted may later be restricted or limited by the competent authorities. The authorities

<<<

 may make such permits or rights subject to new conditions provided these conditions still allow for an economically reasonable exploitation. A delay in obtaining required land plots and gathering information necessary for an application for

<<<

, or the denial of, an allowance, approval, consent, license or permit or other delays in permitting procedures may harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. There can be no guarantee as to when our development

<<<

 projects will receive the appropriate approval and whether the necessary project infrastructure will be completed, whether the resulting operations will achieve the anticipated production volumes or whether the costs in developing these projects

<<<

, including additional costs necessary to comply with conditions imposed by the relevant authorities, will be in line with those anticipated.
The stated stone resources included in this offering memorandum are estimates based on our, and a third

<<<

 party contractor's knowledge, experience and industry practice, and the volume and quality of our actual resources could be substantially lower than such estimates, and may also differfrom those generally disclosed infilings with the U.S. Securities

<<<

 and Exchange Commission in accordance with SEC Industry Guide 7. Our stated resources are not calculated or reported pursuant to or in accordance with the JORC Code.
Our stone resources data with respect to our six active quarries over which

<<<

 we have mining rights, on which our production and capital investment program are based, are estimates that were calculated by a thirdparty contractor, and confirmed by us. There are no requirements under Finnish law relating to the classification

<<<

 or quantification of mineral reserves. The Finnish association of extractive resources industry recommends that mining companies use the Fennoscandian review board's standards of disclosure for mineral projects when they make reports of their

<<<

 mineral projects. These standards are based on the Canadian NI 43-101. However, most mining companies use the reporting standards which are typically employed in the jurisdictions where the companies are listed or systems for which their personnel

<<<

 have accreditation; the JORC Code and CIM/NI 43-101 are frequently used. Our mineral resources are not calculated pursuant to or in accordance with such standards, but rather are calculated through the taking and analysis of core samples, and

<<<

 land surveying, by a third-party contractor.
Our reserve and resource estimates are inherently uncertain and depend on geological assumptions, cost assumptions and statistical inferences which may ultimately prove to have been unreliable. Consequently

<<<

, reserve estimates are often regularly revised based on actual production experience or new information and could change. Furthermore, should we encounter mineralization or formations different from those predicted by past drilling, sampling

<<<

 and similar examinations, the volume or quality projections of our reserve estimates may have to be adjusted and exploitation plans may have to be altered in a way that might adversely affect our operations.
Moreover, increases in capital expenditures

<<<

 necessary for quarry development, production costs, decreases in recovery rates or changes in applicable laws and regulations, including environmental, permitting, title or tax regulations that are adverse to us, could result in the volumes

<<<

 or qualities of stone that we can feasibly extract being significantly lower than the resource estimates indicated in this offering memorandum. If it is determined that the quarrying of certain of our resources has become uneconomical, this

<<<

 may ultimately lead to a reduction in our aggregate stone resources. These variations could be material, and therefore could adversely affect our results of operations.
The estimated volume and quality of resources described in this offering

<<<

 memorandum should not be interpreted as an assurance of the commercial viability, profitability or potential of any future operations. Our production levels at any of our quarries might not reach previous historical production levels, and the

<<<

 volumes of stone that we can feasibly extract may be significantly lower than the reserve and resource estimates indicated in this offering memorandum.
Our resource estimates are disclosed on a different basis than those disclosed in registration

<<<

 statements and other documents filed by other companies with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ``SEC"). The calculation and disclosure principles that are the basis for our reserve calculations may differ in several significant

<<<

 respects from the SEC Industry Guide 7 (``Guide 7"), which governs disclosures of stone or other mineral resources in registration statements and reports filed with the SEC and may differ in several significant respects from reserves calculated

<<<

 pursuant to the JORC Code. In particular, Guide 7 does not recognize classifications other than proven and probable reserves, and the SEC does not permit mining companies to disclose mineral resources estimates other than proven and probable

<<<

 reserves in SEC filings.
39

The resource estimates included in this offering memorandum may include measured, indicated and inferred resources, which are generally not permitted in disclosure filed with the SEC. Under Guide 7, minerals may

<<<

 not be classified as a "reserve" unless the determination has been made that the minerals could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made. All or any part of measured or indicated resources

<<<

 may never be classified as reserves. Further, there is a great amount of uncertainty as to the existence of "inferred resources" and as to whether they can be exploited legally or economically. Accordingly, it should not be assumed that all

<<<

 or any part of an "inferred resource" will be upgraded to a higher category.
We are subject to numerous environmental, building, health and safety regulations, technical standards and other regulations.
We are subject to a number of European

<<<

 Union, national, state and municipal environmental, building and occupational health and safety laws, rules and regulations and technical standards relating to, among other things, the protection of the environment and natural resources, including

<<<

 those governing air emissions, energy performance of buildings, hazardous substances and waste, water discharges and emission of pollutants into water, transportation, remediation of contamination, product requirements, dangerous industrial

<<<

 facilities, sanitary requirements and workplace health and safety. Several of the regulatory requirements that apply to our business operations have in the recent past become more stringent, and we expect some of them to become even more stringent

<<<

 in the future. For further information about the various laws, rules and regulations as well as technical standards applicable to our business operations, see "Regulation. ''
Compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations

<<<

, as well as technical standards applicable to our business operations, entails and is expected to continue to require considerable capital expenditures and other cost. In addition, any violation of or liability under these laws and regulations

<<<

, such as those governing discharges to air and water, contamination of groundwater, sediments or soil, or occupational health and safety, and the failure to maintain necessary permits and approvals, could result in substantial administrative

<<<

 and criminal penalties and remediation cost, temporary or permanent shutdowns of certain of our production facilities, temporary or permanent prohibitions on the marketing and sale of certain products, third-party claims and negative publicity

<<<

. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See "-- Obligations resulting from environmental conditions at our current and former production and other sites could

<<<

 have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations."
We are also required to obtain and maintain permits from governmental authorities for many of our operations. These permits are subject to modification

<<<

, renewal and revocation by governmental authorities. For example, in January 2011, the European Directive 2010/75/EC on industrial emissions ("IED") came into force, which sets out rules on the prevention and control of pollution from industrial

<<<

 activities and includes rules aimed at reducing emissions into air, water and land, as well as preventing the generation of waste in order to achieve a high level of overall environmental protection. From 2016, each of the jurisdictions in

<<<

 which we have manufacturing operations (apart from Russia) has to comply with the emissions limits set for certain industries. However, according to the European Commission, few of these jurisdictions has fully implemented laws necessary to

<<<

 comply with the IED's provisions, and, therefore, future modifications to the permitting requirements in each such jurisdiction are possible to address IED-related requirements. In Finland, the implementation of the IED is currently ongoing

<<<

, while Sweden has fully adopted the IED. The IED is to be implemented by a revision of the Finnish Environmental Protection Act. The revision is ongoing and the new act is expected to enter into force during year 2014. Poland is yet to implement

<<<

 the IED, though it is currently expected that implementing legislation will be passed during 2014 that will require certain terms of existing integrated permits (such as that under which our Trzemeszno plant operates) to be reviewed within

<<<

 three months after the legislation comes into force. Additionally, although the IED and its implementation provide transitional provisions, once a new industry standard becomes binding, existing permits, which are not in compliance with such

<<<

 standard, will not be grandfathered but will be adjusted with respect to the new (binding) standard. In Sweden, however, the emission limits stipulated by the provisions of the IED Directive will not adjust the existing permit provisions, but

<<<

 will apply to the operations in parallel with existing environmental permit conditions. See "Regulation."
We have in the past incurred, and will in the future incur, significant cost for capital and operating expenditures to obtain and maintain

<<<

, or as a result of obligations imposed under, necessary permits. For example, our Hllekis and Hssleholm facilities in Sweden (Skvde is exempt from environmental
40

permitting), which implemented the IED in 2013, will be required to conduct

<<<

 baseline studies to evaluate soil and groundwater conditions either by 2016 or otherwise in connection with any earlier application for an environmental permit application or an amendment to an existing permit. Lappeenranta, which will shut

<<<

 down operations in 2016, is required to conduct a baseline report on soil contamination by the end of October 2015. Certain of our facilities (namely Hssleholm, Oulu and Parainen) expect that it will be necessary to make certain IED-related

<<<

 improvements in order to remain compliant with "best available techniques'' requirements under the directive, which may require significant capital expenditures. However, we cannot ensure that we will also in the future be able to obtain and

<<<

 finance all permits which we require for our business operations. Any such failure or any violation of the terms and conditions of such permits or revocation of existing permits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial

<<<

 condition and results of operations.
We are also required to comply with Regulation (EC) No. 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and Counsel concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals ("REACH"), which

<<<

 requires companies to secure the safe use of substances and chemicals put on the market. REACH requires that, unless exempt, all chemicals and substances manufactured, imported, or used within the EU must be registered with the European Chemicals

<<<

 Agency ("ECHA"). We registered our stone wool fiber, a man-made vitreous (silicate) fiber, with the ECHA in September 2010 and we believe we are compliant with the REACH regulations. Our ECHA registration covers the stone wool fiber used in

<<<

 all of our products. In addition, as we manufacture building materials, regulations on constructions products are applicable to our activities. We are also required to comply with the EU Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive (94/62/EC).
In

<<<

 addition, the disposal of waste is often restricted to licensed facilities and/or by licensed entities or, in some jurisdictions, generators, owners, collectors and transporters of waste must demonstrate to the competent authority and to other

<<<

 parties that they have properly disposed of hazardous waste by proof of waste disposal. Our hazardous waste in Finland is mainly disposed of by authorized hazardous waste management and treatment companies. Non-hazardous waste is either disposed

<<<

 at our own landfills or by waste management companies. We are responsible for costs of the necessary waste management and for the environmental impacts of our operative and closed landfills. Liability for closed landfills may last for several

<<<

 decades. Even though we believe we are in compliance with environmental and waste regulation at the time, remediation liabilities may arise as a result of conditions identified or obligations imposed in the future that could have an adverse

<<<

 effect on our business. See ``--Obligations resulting from environmental conditions at our current and former production and other sites could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results o f operations."

<<<

 Requirements for regulated substances may reduce the possibility for landfill disposals and may result in higher costs of disposal. In addition, we cannot exclude that a so-called "taking back'' obligation may be introduced in the future requiring

<<<

 us to take-back, or fund the take-back, of our products for recycling or disposal when they are discarded by end users, which could result in higher costs to us for disposal of products containing regulated substances.
At our production facilities

<<<

 and quarrying sites, certain particulates are released in the form of dust. Additionally, certain chemical binding agents and other hazardous substances are used at our sites. Future limits on the use of such materials or chemicals may result

<<<

 in additional costs in the production process and more complex handling procedures at construction sites due to more extensive workplace safety requirements. Increased attention has been paid to chemicals in connection with workplace safety

<<<

 and environmental permits in Finland. This may result in requirements to replace chemicals now in use with chemical considered to be safer. This may have adverse effect on our business. In addition, our products contain mineral fibers, which

<<<

 complicates handling at construction sites due to more extensive requirements for worker safety requirements, resulting in increased costs to us. Any occupational safety deviations, discoveries of latent injuries, spills of substances or other

<<<

 accidents could result in claims for damages, capital expenditures for technical improvements, or maintenance to ensure future compliance, which could adversely affect our business. Consumer concern about mineral fibers included in our products

<<<

 or released during production processes, construction or use of certain products may negatively affect the reputation of our products. Our production facilities and quarrying sites also generate noise that is regulated by permit conditions

<<<

 in our environmental permits. Permit conditions regarding noise generally establish a maximum noise threshold, which may vary depending on the time of day. If general noise reference values are updated our permit conditions may be correspondingly

<<<

 altered. This could have adverse effects on our business as we may be required to limit or alter our operations so that applicable noise thresholds are not exceeded.
41

As urbanization continues to progress in many of our operating jurisdictions

<<<

, residential areas have drawn increasingly close to a number of our older sites. For example, Vilnius, Parainen, Lappeenranta and Hssleholm are located close to city centers. Hllekis and Parainen are located close to Natura 2000 sites (EU

<<<

-wide network of "Special Areas of Conservation" designated by Member States under the EU Habitats Directive, and also incorporates ``Special Protection Areas'' which are designated by Member States under the 1979 EU Birds Directive), which

<<<

 require additional focus on emissions levels. Although we expend substantial efforts on community engagement and research and development of solutions to minimize or address potential impacts on nearby communities, we may be compelled to cease

<<<

 or scale back operations at sites located close to residential areas or protected natural reserve areas in response to community pressure or regulatory changes (such as changes in zoning), or to relocate certain households situated in the special

<<<

 protection zone of our facilities. We may not be able to obtain compensation for any such cessation or reduction in production, or may be required to incur substantial expenditures in connection with such relocations, and thus they may have

<<<

 a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See ``--Interruptions in operations at ourfacilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations

<<<

 and cash flows."
The Tver production plant is located in a specially protected natural area--the Zavidovo national park-- and consequently is subject to stricter environmental regulations. For instance, losses incurred as a result of environmental

<<<

 offences committed in specially protected natural areas are required to be compensated by double damages. Administrative liability for environmental offenses committed in such areas can lead to confiscation of the equipment which caused the

<<<

 relevant environmental offence. Moreover, due to its location construction of the Tver production plant requires additional consents to be issued by the administration of the Zavidovo national park. Moreover, we cannot exclude the possibility

<<<

 that in the future any production activities within the territory of the Zavidovo national park may be restricted due to its special status. Should ZAO Paroc violate the existing environmental regulations and/or fail to comply with additional

<<<

 requirements for protection of the national park area and/or fail to effectively arrange for exclusion of its land from the territory of the Zavidovo national park, it may be subject to inspection by the Russian authorities, and administrative

<<<

 or other liabilities, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
We receive government subsidies that may, in certain circumstances, be reduced, withdrawn or required to be repaid

<<<

.
We receive certain subsidies from the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation for research and development financing of certain R&D projects, but there is no guarantee such subsidies will continue in the future. In particular

<<<

, the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation has the right to claw-back these subsidies if certain events specified in the funding conditions (e.g. business changes or reorganizations such as mergers, divisions or significant changes

<<<

 in ownership) occur without its consent within five years after the payment of the subsidies. It is therefore possible that any subsidies received by us, plus interest and fees, may be clawed back if such an event were to occur without its

<<<

 consent. If such claw-back rights were to be triggered and exercised, we would be required to repay such subsidies. The establishment of our financial services center in Vilnius, and the associated training of new employees recruited in connection

<<<

 therewith, was partially funded by EU Structural Funds received by UAB Paroc totaling approximately LTL 1.4 million. The terms and conditions upon which this funding was provided to us include obligations on us to invest at least LTL 6.5 million

<<<

 in the financial center and training projects, and to create at least 50 new jobs at our financial services center. If we fail to reach these targets, the amount of the funds may be decreased proportionally. The terms and conditions also prohibit

<<<

 us from changing the nature or scope of our business, participating in a reorganization, or initiating any liquidation procedure without the prior written consent of the Ministry of Economics and Ministry of Social Security and Labour of the

<<<

 Republic of Lithuania within the five-year period after completion of the relevant investment projects (i.e., until April 5, 2015 (for the financial center project) and July31, 2015 (for the training project)). Additionally, we are obliged

<<<

 to assure the continuity of the projects for the same respective five-year post-completion periods. If we fail to comply with any of these terms and conditions, we may be required to repay all or part of the EU Structural Funds that we have

<<<

 received. This may adversely affect our business, financial position or results of operations.
Changes in the European Union's andMember States'energy efficiencypolicies couldhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition

<<<

, results of operations and cash flows.
The insulation materials industry is strongly influenced by the European Union's policy of targeting a 20% increase in energy efficiency by 2020, pursuant to Directive 2012/27/EU (Energy Efficiency Directive

<<<


42

(``EED")) adopted by the European Parliament and the European Council in 2012. The EED entered into force on December 4, 2012 and obliges Member States to set national energy efficiency targets and report any progress achieved towards

<<<

 these targets to the European Commission by April 30 of each year from 2013. The EED further states that Member States should encourage the use of financing incentives to further the objectives of the EED. Such financing incentives could include

<<<

 financial contributions and fines resulting from non-fulfillment of certain provisions of the EED.
Pursuant to the EED, as an alternative to setting up an energy efficiency obligation scheme, Member States may opt to take other policy measures

<<<

 to achieve energy savings among final customers. The annual amount of new energy savings achieved through this approach would be equivalent to the amount of new energy savings required by the energy efficiency obligation scheme option. Provided

<<<

 that equivalence is maintained, Member States may combine obligation schemes with alternative policy measures, including national energy efficiency programs. The policy measures may include, but are not limited to:
 the implementation of energy

<<<

 or CO2 taxes that have the effect of reducing end-use energy consumption;
 financing schemes and instruments or fiscal incentives that lead to the application of energy-efficient technology or techniques and have the effect of reducing end

<<<

-use energy consumption;
 regulations or voluntary agreements that lead to the application of energy-efficient technology or techniques and have the effect of reducing end-use energy consumption;
 standards and norms that aim at improving

<<<

 the energy efficiency of products and services, including buildings and vehicles, except where these are mandatory and applicable in Member States under EU law;
 energy labeling schemes, with the exception of those that are mandatory and applicable

<<<

 in the Member States under EU law; and
 training and education, including energy advisory programs that lead to the application of energy efficient technology or techniques and have the effect of reducing end-use energy consumption.
Because

<<<

 demand for our insulation materials (and panels containing such materials), which are more energy efficient than many competing types of insulation, is currently supported, or is expected to be supported by, actions taken by governments pursuant

<<<

 to the EED in many of the countries in which we operate, any changes to the EED or associated programs that reduce the requirements imposed thereby, or the level of government support or subsidies for energy-efficient insulation may have a

<<<

 material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Regulations regarding carbon dioxide emissions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations

<<<

.
We operate a total of nine production plants in addition to other industrial facilities. Our operations result in the release of substantial quantities of carbon dioxide, particularly through the combustion of coke in our manufacturing process

<<<

. The emission of carbon dioxide is subject to a constantly developing body of laws and regulatory requirements addressing the challenges of global climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting higher efficiency in the use of

<<<

 energy from conventional sources and increasing the use of energy from renewable sources. In the European Union, regulations attempt to both reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to establish a mechanism for trading in carbon dioxide emission

<<<

 allowances under the EU Emissions Trading System (``EU ETS"). The trading period of the EU ETS commenced in 2013, and the quantity of emission allowances allocated each year in the European Union was reduced by a linear factor of 1.74% annually

<<<

 as compared to the average annual total quantity of emission allowances issued in previous years. In addition, since January 2013, a full auctioning of emission allowances has been gradually introduced for the manufacturing sector by reducing

<<<

 the allocation of emission allowances free of charge from 80% in 2013 to 30% in 2020 and to 0% in 2027.
As a result, we will need to purchase a significant, and steadily increasing, share of emission allowances in auctions in the future, which

<<<

 will result in substantial additional cost, depending on certain factors. In particular, certain energy-intensive industries which are exposed to a significant risk of relocation to countries with less stringent climate protection laws, a phenomenon

<<<

 known as ``carbon leakage,'' will receive free allowances corresponding to their sector specific ``benchmark value'' of emissions levels. If granted free emissions allowances because of a ``carbon leakage'' classification, an installation is

<<<

 not subject to the aforementioned reduction of free allowance allocations from 80% to 30% between 2013 and
43

2020, but instead receives free allowances determined in accordance with the benchmark value applicable to the relevant sector.

<<<

 Although all of our manufacturing plants other than the Tver facility, the Panel System facility at Parainen and the Skovde facility are subject to the EU ETS, each of these sites benefit from the current carbon leakage exemption granted in

<<<

 2012 for the years 2013-2014 pursuant to Commission Decision 2012/498/EU (amending Commission Decision 2010/2/EU and Commission Decision 2011/278/EU), and have therefore initially been allocated emission allowances free of charge corresponding

<<<

 to the mineral wool sector benchmark value and the average historical annual level of production performed in the relevant installation, calculated for the higher of the periods between 2005 and 2008, and 2009 and 2010. The European Commission

<<<

 will determine every five years which industries are threatened by carbon leakage. Thus, there is no certainty that the stone wool industry will again be considered as being threatened by carbon leakage. Although the mineral wool sector has

<<<

 again been specified as a sector deemed to be exposed to a significant risk of carbon leakage in the draft European Commission decision published on May 5, 2014 regarding the 2015-2019 carbon leakage list, there is no guarantee that the sector

<<<

 will be included in the list ultimately adopted by the European Commission following scrutiny by the EU Climate Change Committee, the European Parliament and the Council. If the European Commission concludes that no such threat of carbon leakage

<<<

 exists in 2014 or at the time of any later determination, the regular emissions reduction scheme would also apply to our manufacturing plants and we would be required to purchase emission allowances in the amount required for our production

<<<

 purposes. Even assuming that carbon leakage status is maintained by the stone wool industry, we estimate that we will have an average annual shortfall of approximately 29% in emissions allowances across the whole Paroc Group during Phase III

<<<

 (2013 to 2020) and this shortfall will be greater if carbon leakage status is not maintained). In addition, new production capacity may not be eligible for carbon leakage status, unless the operations meet the required criteria for new entrants

<<<

. We expect the future cost of purchasing necessary additional emissions allowances to be material, although we do not have an estimate at this time given that the emissions allowance market is an open market with fluctuating prices. See ``Regulation

<<<

--Finland-- Climate Change Law--Emission Trading Law in the European Union," "--Sweden-- Emission Trading Law in the European Union, " "--Lithuania--Emission Trading Law in the European Union" and ``--Poland--Emission Trading Law in the European

<<<

 Union." Compliance with existing, new or proposed regulations governing such emissions might lead to a need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, to purchase rights to emit carbon dioxide from third parties, or to make other changes to our business

<<<

, all of which could result in significant additional cost or could reduce demand for our products. In addition, we require large quantities of energy in various forms for our production processes. Existing, new and proposed regulations relating

<<<

 to the emission of carbon dioxide by our energy suppliers could result in materially increased energy cost for our operations and we may be unable to pass on these increased energy cost to our customers, which could have a material adverse

<<<

 effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See "--Increased energy cost or disruptions in energy supplies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations."
We have

<<<

 no control over the security and operational processes of the national registriesfor emissions allowances within Europe.
We own a significant number of emissions allowances and emission credits, which are registered as intangible assets by

<<<

 national registries in individual EU countries. National emissions allowances and emission credits registries are operated by independent governmental bodies and are governed by EU law. We have no control over or influence on the security and

<<<

 operational processes of these national registries. The financial value of our assets registered in such registries is significant and a change in the quantity of permitted emissions represented by our allowances and credits or an unauthorized

<<<

 transfer on the relevant registries of such allowances and credits to another party could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Obligations resultingfrom environmental conditions

<<<

 at our current andformer production and other sites could have a material adverse effect on our business,financial condition and results of operations.
Many of our current and former facilities and properties have long histories of industrial

<<<

 operations. In addition, we have responsibility for a number of sites we have acquired, or that we owned or operated in the past. At many of our sites, hazardous substances and waste are or have been used or stored in significant quantities

<<<

. Contaminants have been detected at some of these sites. For example, groundwater and/or soil contamination has been found at our Hssleholm, Oulu, Parainen, Trzemeszno and Tver sites. In 2005, we conducted environmental remediation when resin

<<<

 leaked from a broken hose at Oulu. Although our remedial responsibilities at these sites, other than the Lappeenranta site and the Oulu site in
44

2005, have not been material to date, the ultimate cost of remediation is difficult to accurately

<<<

 predict, and we could incur significant additional cost as a result of the discovery of additional contamination or the imposition of additional remediation obligations at these or other sites in the future, including in connection with site

<<<

 investigations that may be necessary in complying with IED requirements or the closure of our Lappeenranta site. In some cases, we may also incur costs related to remediation of pre-existing contamination of properties owned by us which has

<<<

 not been caused by us, if the original polluter cannot be established in the course of administrative proceedings or, in certain jurisdictions, because we are the current owner of the relevant property. We may also incur significant costs in

<<<

 seeking to enforce contractual indemnities provided to us in respect of environmental liabilities by other parties conducting operations at our sites, and we may not be successful in enforcing such indemnities. Moreover, certain permits which

<<<

 we need to carry out our operations contain provisions requiring us to remediate possible contamination or old landfills, and it is possible that such provisions will be introduced into our other necessary permits. See ``Regulation--Finland

<<<

--Soil and Groundwater Contamination," "--Sweden-- Soil and Groundwater Contamination," "--Poland-- Soil and Groundwater Contamination and "--Russia-- Soil."
In relation to the Lappeenranta site, as at December 31, 2013, we have recognized an

<<<

 environmental provision of 6.9 million for demolition and other costs related to the closure of the Lappeenranta facility. However, costs in excess of this provision may be required to be incurred by us in order to comply with our ultimate

<<<

 remediation obligations, which are difficult to accurately predict. In addition, we may have failed to properly identify and assess potential risks with respect to plants and sites that we have acquired in the past, for example at Skovde, the

<<<

 prior occupants produced polystyrene, and we would be liable for any contamination discovered in the future under Swedish law. In such a case, we might not succeed in claiming damages or indemnification against the relevant seller; our ability

<<<

 to seek indemnification from the relevant seller may be limited by various factors, including the financial condition of the indemnifying or responsible party as well as by contractual or legal limits on such indemnities or obligations (for

<<<

 example, in the case of the Tver production plant, most of the associated assets were purchased pursuant to a bankruptcy sale and so recourse to the vendor of the assets may not be possible). Furthermore, there is no insurance coverage for

<<<

 financial liabilities arising from soil, water and other forms of contamination. In addition, we may be responsible for any contamination detected at a site that we have sold or vacated in the past, if the contamination is traced back to our

<<<

 use of the site. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We are subject to certain restrictions and reclamation and recultivation obligations resultingfrom our

<<<

 Finnish law mining rights, as well as to Finnish environmental regulations, which could adversely affect our ability to expand our business, our financial condition, our results operations and cash flows.
As one of the prerequisites for obtaining

<<<

 a permit to quarry a designated area, we are required by the Finnish mining and environmental authorities to provide a reclamation plan which obligates us to restore the quarrying site in accordance with specific standards. As part of this

<<<

 reclamation plan, we are required to create, and annually adjust, non-cash reserves to cover these future reclamation costs, which are calculated by discounting estimated costs under the reclamation plan to their present value. Furthermore

<<<

, our environmental permits and mining district decisions (i.e., mining concessions in Finland) require us to collateralize our obligations to remediate waste areas and mining district or permit areas. The requirement to provide collateral for

<<<

 the remediation of mining district areas was introduced in connection with the 2011 reform of the Finnish mining legislation and the Mining Authority has accepted our proposal that we provide a three-year bank guarantee in the amount of 50

<<<

,000 to cover all of our mining districts. See "Regulation--Finland--Excavation of Stone Resources."
It is possible that the relevant authorities might demand reserves or security in the future, in response to increases in expected reclamation

<<<

 costs. The relevant legislator may also tighten the requirements to obtain quarrying rights or the terms and conditions under which quarrying rights are granted. In the event of a material adverse change in our financial condition, or in response

<<<

 to an economic downturn or volatility in the financial markets, financial assurance providers may have the right and could decide not to issue or renew the financial assurances, to demand additional collateral upon renewal, or to require us

<<<

 to obtain a discharge of the financial assurance provider's liability under the financial assurances or to provide cash or letters of credit equal to 100% of the amount of the outstanding financial assurances. A failure to maintain or renew

<<<

, or our inability to acquire or provide a suitable alternative for, any such financial assurances and any exercise of rights the financial assurance providers have to require us to discharge the related liability
45

or to provide additional

<<<

 collateral would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
As of December 31, 2013, we had a 7.3 million non-cash environmental provision for restoration and decommissioning booked as a liability

<<<

 included in the consolidated Paroc Group balance sheet pursuant to IFRS, and no cash reserves. These environmental provisions relate to costs from future closure of quarries related to landscaping, security arrangements and stacking area lining

<<<

 work and future closure of dumpsites related to landscaping, as well as the 6.9 million provision for the demolition costs relating to the closure of the Lappeenranta facility. The provisions for dumpsites are estimated to be used between 

<<<

2014 and 2019. The provisions for quarries are estimated to be used between 2020 and 2096. Changes to the assumptions used to estimate the present value of the provisions, such as the applicable discount rate, the inflation rate and the estimated

<<<

 future cash costs related to reclamation, can have a substantial impact on such provisions, and can also have an impact on financial results for the Paroc Group.
If the necessary scope for restoration and remediation activities increases, or

<<<

 if we have underestimated the costs of such restoration and remediation, we may be required to create higher provisions or spend greater amounts than anticipated. For example, reclamation costs could further increase if, after draining the

<<<

 quarries, groundwater levels exceed pre-quarrying levels and cause flooding, including damage to buildings and infrastructure, as the quarrying operator is, in principle, held responsible for such damage. In addition, we may be liable for damages

<<<

 caused by our activities or associated with our quarrying activities on properties owned by third parties. Furthermore, anticipated costs may be affected by possible third party claims resulting from damage caused by our operations. In either

<<<

 case, we could be required to make significant payments in the future, adversely impacting our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Any requirement to increase our provisions could adversely impact our business

<<<

, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
We may need to write down goodwill and brands, which would adversely affect our financial results.
As of December 31, 2013, 39.4% of our total group assets were intangible assets,

<<<

 with 26.2% and 3.2% of our total group assets corresponding to goodwill and brands with indefinite useful lives, respectively. Goodwill arising from an acquisition represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the acquisition

<<<

 date fair values of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and contingent liabilities recognized. Goodwill is recognized at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not amortized but tested

<<<

 for impairment annually whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a cash generating unit may not be recoverable. Preparation of these calculations requires the use of estimates and assumptions. The key

<<<

 assumptions used in cash flow projections are based on management estimates and estimates made by certain third parties. The most significant key assumption affecting the projections is the development of residential construction business,

<<<

 as well as the development of commercial building construction business which has an effect on our panels segment. For our insulation segment, an increase in discount rate of 0.5 percentage points or any other reduction in gross margin of 

<<<

1.2 percentage points, of the estimated gross margins would cause the cash generating units' recoverable amount to be equal to its carrying amount. According to our estimates, in other cash generating units, any reasonably possible change in

<<<

 a key variable would not create a scenario in which the unit's carrying value would exceed its value in use.
In determining that the Paroc brand has an indefinite useful life, we have considered various factors such as the past and expected

<<<

 longevity of the brand, the impact of possible changes in technologies and the impact of possible evolutions of the regulatory environment. Based on the analysis of these factors, we have determined and confirmed at December 31, 2013 that there

<<<

 is no foreseeable limit to the period of time over which the Paroc brand is expected to generate cash inflows for the Group. Paroc brand is not amortized but tested for impairment annually.
We believe that our brands are important to our ongoing

<<<

 success, and damage to our brands could harm our business results and reputation.
During the year ended December 31, 2013, we generated the majority of our product sales (i.e., sales excluding service sales, trading goods, transportation and

<<<

 inter-segment sales) from products marketed mainly under the PAROC and PARAFON brands. We believe that the brand awareness, preference and loyalty that some professional and end-user customers exhibit for these brands in many markets in which

<<<

 we operate are an important competitive advantage. The maintenance and protection of our brands are therefore important for our future success. If we are unable to protect and promote our brands effectively,
46

our brands might not continue

<<<

 to be recognized by our relevant customer groups for their high quality and advanced technical standards. This could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.
Currency rate and

<<<

 interest ratefluctuations might adversely affect ourfinancialposition and results ofoperations.
Due to our international business activities, we are exposed to a variety of financial risks. In particular, these include risks related to changes

<<<

 in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Although we may enter into derivatives transactions from time to time to hedge against interest rate and currency risks, we may misjudge the extent to which such hedges are required and

<<<

, accordingly, be required to pay rates exceeding the prevailing market price under our hedging agreements to effect certain transactions.
Interest rate risks exist as a result of potential changes in the market interest rate and might lead

<<<

 to a change in fair value in the case of fixed interest-bearing financial instruments, and to fluctuations in interest payments in the case of variable interest-bearing financial instruments. Our interest risks arise primarily from short-term

<<<

 deposits and draw-downs on cash loan facilities. As of December 31, 2013, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, approximately 230 million of our third-party indebtedness would have had a floating interest rate. With regard to variable

<<<

 interest-bearing financial instruments, changes in market rates have an impact on our interest expense. We may decide to put hedging in place for our New Revolving Credit Facility, our Floating Rate Notes or any other variable rate debt obligations

<<<

 we may have outstanding from time to time in the future. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-- Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk--Interest rate risk. ''
Our consolidated

<<<

 financial statements are presented in euros, which is the functional and reporting currency of the Group. Currency risk arises through fluctuations of the exchange rate of the currencies of countries that are not part of the European Monetary

<<<

 Union and their impact on our results of operations and statements of financial position as we translate the financial results from our subsidiaries in those countries to the euro. We also face transactional currency exchange rate risks if

<<<

 income generated in one currency is accompanied by cost in another currency. Net currency exposure from sales denominated in foreign currencies arises to the extent that we do not incur corresponding expenses in the same foreign currencies

<<<

.
Other than the euro and the Lithuanian litas (which is pegged to the euro), the principal currencies we transact in are the Swedish krona, the Danish krone, the Norwegian krone, the Polish zloty, the Russian rouble and the British pound. Currency

<<<

 exchange rate risks exist in connection with inter-company transactions between Group companies with different functional currencies. Exchange rate risks related to such inter-company transactions are managed by intragroup sales to subsidiaries

<<<

 domiciled in jurisdictions that are not part of the European Monetary Union being denominated in their own functional currencies, such that currency risk is concentrated at the producing entities. We do not hedge our net investments in our

<<<

 subsidiaries. We attempt to absorb short- and medium-term exchange rate fluctuations through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts. Specifically, we forecast our cash flows by currency on a rolling six-month basis and hedge between

<<<

 60% and 80% of those estimated cash flows, calculated on a Group basis. We also require our subsidiaries to follow standardized group procedures and guidelines regarding the management of exchange rate risk. As of December 31, 2013, for such

<<<

 purposes we had outstanding currency forward agreements amounting in total to 33.4 million. However, these hedging transactions may prove to be insufficient. In the context of such transactions, we are also exposed to the risk of the insolvency

<<<

 of the relevant hedge counterparty.
Currency exchange risks also exist in connection with inter-company loans between Group companies with different functional currencies. For example, as a result of a restructuring of the Group that occurred

<<<

 in 2009, there is currently an outstanding SEK-denominated intercompany loan from Paroc Group Oy (the functional currency of which is the euro) to Paroc Sverige AB (the functional currency of which is the Swedish krona) which, as of December

<<<

 31, 2013, had a book value of 225.8 million. Due to movements in the euro-krona exchange rate since that loan was established in 2009, as at December 31, 2013, Paroc Group Oy has an unrealized gain in the amount of 20 million in respect of

<<<

 that loan. In connection with the Transactions, we may repay this intercompany loan and replace it with a new SEK-denominated intercompany loan from Paroc Group Oy to Paroc Sverige AB, which may be in an amount that is greater than the amount

<<<

 of the existing loan. When this loan is repaid (whether in connection with the Transactions or otherwise), any foreign exchange gain would become taxable at the applicable taxation rate in Finland, which is currently 20%. To the extent we replace

<<<

 this intercompany loan in the future, we will
47

be exposed to similar risks of incurring taxable foreign exchange gains upon repayment such replacement loans.
We may also be exposed to currency exchange rate risks if we commit to making

<<<

 substantial future expenditures denominated in a currency other than one of our principal transacting currencies, or in an amount of one of our transacting currencies that is significantly greater than the amounts of that currency that we generally

<<<

 deal in. We generally manage these risks through hedging transactions entered into by the relevant Group company. For example, during the construction phase of our new Tver manufacturing facility, we hedged our significant Russian rouble exposures

<<<

 arising from the capital expenditure commitments involved in that project through currency forward purchase agreements covering our entire expected Russian rouble exposure for that project.
It is impossible to hedge completely against exchange

<<<

 rate fluctuations. The business activities of our foreign competitors could be favored by exchange rate advantages, meaning that we may lose customers and suffer a decline in sales. As the foreign exchange markets are characterized by high

<<<

 volatility, exchange rate fluctuations could in the future have a material adverse effect on our net assets, financial position and results of operations. Should we be unable to structure our earnings capacity more independently of exchange

<<<

 rate fluctuations, this could have negative effects on our sales and results of operations.
We have obligations to our employees relating to retirement and other obligations, the calculations of which are based on a number of assumptions, including

<<<

 discount rates and life expectancies, which may differfrom actual rates in the future.
We operate an unfunded defined-benefit pension scheme for beneficiaries under an arrangement that has been established in Sweden.
Our exposures under the

<<<

 Finnish defined contribution scheme, which mandatorily applies to all employees in Finland, are insured insofar as sponsors retain no risk in respect of past service benefits once they pay contributions at the rates set by the Finnish Ministry

<<<

 of Social Affairs and Health. Contribution rates for this scheme are set centrally by the Finnish Ministry of Social Affairs and Health, there is a risk that contribution rates may be increased in the future so as to have a material adverse

<<<

 effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Our exposures under the Swedish defined contribution scheme are fully insured as to benefits that accrued after March 31, 1994 pursuant to arrangements under which we pay regular

<<<

 premiums according to pension schemes agreed in the Swedish collective bargaining agreements. However, we have unfunded exposures under the PRI plan as to certain benefits accrued up to and including March 31, 1994. The PRI solution enables

<<<

 the company to retain the pension capital within the company, with the company making an annual provision in its balance sheet corresponding to the value of the accrued pension debt. The PRI plan is not funded by way of paying recurring pension

<<<

 premiums, but instead is handled in accordance with the obligations under the PRI arrangement, which require the payment of the pension as and when it falls due (i.e., as an employee covered under the PRI plan retires). Around 130 current employees

<<<

 have benefits that accrued prior to April 1994, with a further 210 pensioners currently in receipt of benefits that accrued prior to April 1994. As of December 31, 2013, we had total unfunded pension obligations under the Swedish PRI plan of

<<<

 10.1 million. We are also required by law to obtain credit insurance from PRI Pensionsgaranti in respect of these defined benefits obligations, and PRI Pensionsgaranti also has the power to require us to provide additional security towards

<<<

 these benefits, or even obtain insurance in respect of the benefits. We have provided PRI Pensionsgaranti with a letter of credit in the amount of SEK 35 million in respect of our unfunded pension obligations (the "Pensions L/C"), as well as

<<<

 a parent company guarantee (from the Issuer) covering amounts in excess thereof. It is possible that, in the event of any material change in our capital structure or ownership, PRI Pensionsgaranti may require us to provide similar or additional

<<<

 security or credit support, or obtain pension insurance, at significant expense to us.
The remainder of the pension schemes we operate or are required to contribute to are defined contribution schemes. In some countries, including Russia, we

<<<

 are subject to mandatory pension and other social contributions and we cannot exclude the possibility that the welfare policies in such countries and the growing number of the beneficiaries under the pension legislation would lead to the increase

<<<

 of the amount of contributions that may adversely negatively influence our business and financial results.
Our defined benefit obligations are based on certain actuarial assumptions that can vary by defined benefit plan, including discount

<<<

 rates and life expectancies and rates of increase in future compensation levels. If actual results, especially discount rates or life expectancies were to differ from our assumptions, our
48

pension obligations could be higher than expected

<<<

 and we could incur actuarial re-measurements. Changes in all assumptions or under performance of plan assets could also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In the fiscal years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and

<<<

 2013 actuarial gains and losses were charged or credited to equity through other comprehensive income. In the beginning of January 1, 2013 we have applied the revised International Accounting Standard (``IAS 19"). Revised IAS 19 did not have

<<<

 a significant impact on our financial statements in 2013. Under IAS 19 (revised), the approach to assess interest cost and expected return on plan assets is replaced by compulsory application of a uniform, market-based discount rate to both

<<<

 the defined benefit liability and any corresponding plan asset (net interest approach). Future declines in the value of plan assets or lower-than-expected returns may require us to make additional current cash payments to pension plans. However

<<<

, our current defined benefit schemes do not include plan assets as defined by IAS 19. Significantly increased contribution obligations could have adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, local funding

<<<

 rules might require additional contributions to avoid underfunding. The defined benefit plan in Sweden is operated by Alecta, which is not able to split the plan assets by company. Consequently, the plan operated by Alecta has been accounted

<<<

 for as a defined contribution plan. Top management located in Finland and Sweden has individual voluntary pension plans. These plans entitle a pension at the age of 62. The plans were changed in 2010 so that they are classified as defined contribution

<<<

 plans.
As part of the Finnish statutory defined contribution pension plan, there has been a system of registered supplementary pensions that was created to supplement the statutory pension scheme. The registered supplementary pension system

<<<

 was closed to new insured in 2001, but approximately 90 of our employees are still covered by this scheme. However, due to legislative changes, such schemes will have to be discontinued by the year 2016. We may, therefore, be obligated to agree

<<<

 on a new pension arrangement with the employees who have not yet retired but are within the scheme by, for example, taking out a group life insurance for the employee. Upon the occurrence of certain conditions the employer may pay a lump-sum

<<<

 payment. Depending on the arrangements chosen, such a change may cause additional costs to us in the form of several lump-sum payments or increased insurance costs.
In the fiscal years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, pension payments

<<<

 amounted to 8.5 million, 9.9 million and 10.5 million, respectively, of which payments in respect of our unfunded and uninsured defined benefit obligations comprised 0.4 million (plus additional expenses incurred in connection with the Pensions

<<<

 L/C) in each year.
We are dependent on qualified personnel in key positions and employees having special technical knowledge.
Qualified and motivated personnel is one of the key factors for the further development of our business, in particular

<<<

 our further technological development and geographic expansion. There is a risk that we may not be able to attract key personnel, or employ foreign citizens in certain markets (such as Russia, where we have in the past had difficulty getting

<<<

 approval to employ foreign citizens), to fill vacancies or that we fail to retain key employees. Personnel shortages and the loss of key employees could negatively influence our further business development. In addition, there are risks related

<<<

 to our dependence on individual persons in key positions, particularly at the level of the managing board as well as in the areas of development, distribution, service, production, finance and marketing. The loss of management personnel or

<<<

 employees in key positions would lead to a loss of know-how, or under certain circumstances, to the passing on of this know-how to our competitors. If one or more of these risks materialize, this could adversely affect our business, financial

<<<

 condition and results of operations.
Our business may be affected by the default of counterparties in respect of money owed to us.
In the ordinary course of our business, we are often owed significant amounts of money by numerous counterparties

<<<

, including customers. We manage customer credit risk for trade receivables through insuring sales in all significant countries. All sales above 5,000 are covered with a deductible of 10%. We apply internal credit policies and regularly analyze

<<<

 the status of trade receivables. In addition, we often hold significant cash balances on deposit with financial institutions or invested on a short-term basis. These contractual arrangements, deposits and other financial instruments give rise

<<<

 to credit risk on amounts due from such counterparties. The Group's treasury monitors counterparty credit ratings, however, credit risks arising from transactions with financial counterparties in particular can escalate rapidly and a high credit

<<<

 rating is no guarantee that an entity will not experience a rapid deterioration of its financial position. During the financial crisis and the economic downturn, we were increasingly exposed to the default of counterparties, including financial

<<<

 institutions and customers with bad debts. If the economic conditions do not improve or continue to worsen, this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
49

We depend on efficient and uninterrupted

<<<

 operations of our information and communication technology.
The operation of our production facilities as well as our sales and service activities depend on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex and sophisticated computer, telecommunication

<<<

 and data processing systems. Computer and data processing systems and related infrastructure (data center, hardware and wide and local area networks) are generally exposed to the risk of human errors, disturbances, contractual discontinuity

<<<

, damage, electricity failures, computer viruses, fire, other disasters, hacker attacks and similar events. Disruptions to operations or interruptions in operations involving the systems may occur in the future and minor interruptions have occurred

<<<

 in individual cases in the past. Although administration and production networks are separated, an interruption in the operations of computer or data processing systems could adversely affect our ability to efficiently maintain our production

<<<

 processes and to ensure adequate controls. Disruptions to or interruptions in operations could lead to production downtime which, in turn, could result in lost sales. Information and communication technology-related risks are particularly relevant

<<<

 since, even though our business critical applications have been consolidated, our information technology landscape is partly decentralized for non-business critical applications. The different platforms used throughout the group for key processes

<<<

 may lead to inefficiencies, such as problems with interoperability, malfunctions and higher cost, as well as to difficulties in the administration of the scope and contents of the required licenses and related support services acquired from

<<<

 third-party service providers that may render the company vulnerable to risks associated with contract discontinuity. Further, we are dependent on the expertise of third-party contractors and service providers operating certain key information

<<<

 technology systems, which may increase the risk of service interruptions. Our standard group wide information technology systems may be disturbed, damaged or disrupted. If one or more of these risks materializes, this could materially adversely

<<<

 affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our risk management and internal controls may not prevent or detect violations of law.
Our existing compliance processes and controls may not be sufficient in order to prevent

<<<

 or detect inadequate practices, fraud and violations of law by our contractors and customers, intermediaries, sales agents and employees. These risks may increase as we expand into new markets, especially Russia. In certain business transactions

<<<

, we cooperate with intermediaries or sales agents whose activities we are not able to control, especially in connection with promoting business in certain countries and in connection with mergers and acquisitions. We pay the intermediaries

<<<

 customary commissions. We also cooperate with consultants in relation to the expansion of our business activities, such as in certain eastern European markets, for example, Russia.
In the case that any contractors, customers, intermediaries

<<<

, consultants, sales agents or employees with whom we cooperate receive or grant inappropriate benefits or generally use corrupt, fraudulent or other unfair business practices, including sham tax schemes, we could be confronted with associated

<<<

 financial losses, legal sanctions, penalties and loss of orders and harm to our reputation. For example, we are currently involved in litigation relating to alleged embezzlement in 2011 and 2012 by a former employee of our Latvian subsidiary

<<<

 of goods with a total value of approximately LVL 104,000 from us using a system of fake invoicing, which we allege also resulted in additional VAT liabilities totaling approximately LVL 22,000 in respect of the allegedly misappropriated goods

<<<

. Both criminal and civil proceedings in relation to these allegations are currently ongoing. However, we may not be able to recover the full amount of the losses we allege that we have sustained in connection with these matters, and may incur

<<<

 substantial legal costs in attempting to do so. We conducted thorough internal investigations in relation to these incidents and introduced consequential amendments to our internal systems and controls. Nonetheless, given our global alignment

<<<

, complex group structure, size and the extent of our cooperation with intermediaries, consultants and sales agents, our internal controls and procedures, policies and our risk management may not be adequate, which may result in similar occurrences

<<<

 in the future having a material negative impact on our reputation, business activities, financial position and results of operations.
Our international sales are subject to variousjurisdictions'economic sanctions, export control and anti-corruption

<<<

 laws and regulations, which increases the risk that we may become subject to significantpenaltiesfor violating such laws.
We operate on a global basis and are subject to laws of the EU and other jurisdictions regulating the export of our products

<<<

 to certain countries. For instance, Belarus is subject to sanctions under the laws of the U.S., the EU, and other jurisdictions. For the year ended December 31, 2013, 12.1 million of revenues (3%, of our total sales) came from Belarus, which

<<<

 we conduct through a representation office in Belarus.
50

We have additionally agreed to sell products to a customer in Iraq on a project-specific basis, and could sell other products to customers in sanctioned countries in the future on

<<<

 a project-specific basis. We do not believe that any of our exports or customers are designated or targeted by U.S. or EU sanctions. Nevertheless, due to political instability in Ukraine it is possible that further sanctions will be imposed

<<<

 on Russia that may effect on our operations. See ``-- We operate in emerging markets such as Russia, which exposes us to risks inherent to such less developed markets, and we may be exposed to greater risks as we intend to increase our operations

<<<

 in such markets " We have implemented certain policies and procedures to address compliance with sanctions, export controls and anti-corruption laws and regulations, including limited training to educate our employees about these topics, but

<<<

 we do not currently maintain formal group-wide written policies or training detailing how to comply with such laws. Although we are committed to conducting our operations in accordance with applicable laws and will continue to implement our

<<<

 current policies and procedures, the absence of formal policies and training detailing specific compliance procedures may make it more difficult to control and monitor full compliance of our activities in countries subject to U.S., EU or other

<<<

 sanctions with applicable anti-corruption laws. We are in the process of planning formal group-wide policies and procedures, including formal employee training, to ensure continued compliance with sanctions, export controls and anti-corruption

<<<

 laws and regulations and expect these formal compliance procedures to be implemented group-wide by the end of 2014. Failure to comply with these laws could expose us to civil and criminal prosecution and penalties, the imposition of export

<<<

 or economic sanctions against the Group, and reputational damage, all of which could materially and adversely affect the Group's financial results.
We also conduct business in countries where there is governmental and private corruption. We

<<<

 are committed to doing business in accordance with all applicable laws, but there is a risk that we or our respective officers, directors, employees or agents may act in violation of our codes and applicable laws. Any such violations could

<<<

 result in substantial civil and criminal penalties and might materially adversely affect our business and results of operations or financial condition.
If the European Monetary Union ceases to exist or one or more countries leave the European

<<<

 Monetary Union, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.
Recent economic events affecting the European economies, including the sovereign debt and other economic crises in Cyprus, Greece

<<<

, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain, have raised a number of questions regarding the overall stability of the European Monetary Union. Despite measures taken by countries in the European Monetary Union and the European Central Bank

<<<

 to alleviate credit risk, concerns persist with respect to the ability of certain European Monetary Union countries to meet future financial obligations, the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency

<<<

 given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual euro member states. The economic outlook is adversely affected by the risk that one or more European Monetary Union countries could come under increasing pressure to leave

<<<

 the European Monetary Union, that the euro could cease to be the single currency of the European Monetary Union, or that certain post-Soviet states, with weaker economic fundamentals, could become part of the European Monetary Union. The legal

<<<

 and contractual consequences of such a development for the business of the Group and for holders of the Notes would be determined by applicable laws in effect at such time. Any of these developments, or a perception that any of these developments

<<<

 may be likely to occur, could have a material adverse effect on the economic development of the affected countries or lead to economic recession or depression that could jeopardize the stability of financial markets or the overall financial

<<<

 and monetary system. This, in turn, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We may incur material cost as a result ofwarranty, product liability orpersonal injury claims which could

<<<

 adversely affect our profitability.
Our products are subject to express and implied warranties and we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims, including class action claims, in the event that the use of any of

<<<

 our products results in personal injury or property damage. In the event that any of our products is defective or proves to be defective, among other things, we may be responsible for damages related to any defective products, including damages

<<<

 for indirect or consequential losses, and we may be required to recall or redesign such products. Because of the long useful life of our products, it is possible that latent defects might not appear for several years. Similarly, although Finnish

<<<

 Emission Classification of Building Materials tests on our insulation products for volatile organic compounds emissions currently categorize them as low-emitting building materials, it is possible that this categorization may be revised in

<<<

 the future.
51

Any such revisions may expose us to material claims, interruptions to our business and research and development expenditures that may consequentially be required in order to modify our products. We therefore may not be successful

<<<

 in maintaining or reducing the historical level of warranty claims and claims in connection with the supply of our products may increase significantly. Additionally, defects in our products may result in product recalls, adverse customer reactions

<<<

 and negative publicity about us or our products. Product failures, in particular of insulation materials or panels produced by us or our predecessors or acquired businesses or facilities, could result in substantial harm to people or property

<<<

. We hold insurance for product liability risks, and in many instances have contractual arrangements to limit or exclude our liability or hold us harmless against such claims (though such arrangements may not in the past have always been effectively

<<<

 included in our supply agreements). However, such insurance and contractual arrangements may not adequately cover any such matter, insurance coverage may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, the insurance carrier or

<<<

 the contractual partner may not have sufficient funds to cover all claims, if any, or such contractual arrangements may not be valid or enforceable or may not cover our activities in certain jurisdictions. Defects may also require expensive

<<<

 modifications to our products and may adversely affect our reputation. If any of these events occur, our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected, even if we are not legally

<<<

 liable for particular claims.
A small number of the current and former employees of the Finnish Group companies and their predecessor entities, including five of our current employees, have probably worked in the past under circumstances that

<<<

 exposed them to asbestos-containing materials associated with certain activities conducted by previous owners of some of our plants. In accordance with the Finnish employment legislation, employees' existing rights and obligations automatically

<<<

 transfer to the new employer upon a transfer of business, and have thus transferred to us in connection with our purchase of these assets in 1998. An employee who has been injured or has a medical condition due to exposure may claim damages

<<<

 for the amount of lost salary and other damages that are not covered by the Statutory Worker's Compensation Insurance. The magnitude of potential damage is, however, limited by the principle of the prohibition of enrichment, which is a fundamental

<<<

 principle of Finnish tort law. Compensation is as a rule only issued for proven losses (i.e. punitive damages are not awarded). Although no such claims for compensation by our employees, insurers or other parties have been presented to us,

<<<

 if claims for compensation or otherwise relating to past activities are made against us in the future, it could have a significant and adverse effect on our reputation and business and financial condition. See "Regulation-- Finland--Asbestos

<<<

 Containing Material (ACM)."
Prior to Paroc ownership, there was an asbestos-cement sheet production plant at our Trzemeszno site in Poland, which was established in 1968 and shut down in 1998 when the former parent company of Paroc (Partek

<<<

, a Finnish industrial conglomerate) acquired the stone wool production departments (the other departments were acquired by third parties). Although we understand that all asbestos materials were removed before Partek purchased the site, it

<<<

 is possible that we could incur material expenses in cleaning-up any residual impacts that are identified, or as result of any liability claims that are brought against us, in the future.
Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover

<<<

 all the risks we mayface and if we were no longer covered by our existing insurance, it may be difficult to obtain replacement insurance on acceptable terms or at all.
Our production plants, equipment and other assets are insured for property

<<<

 damage and business interruption risks and our business as a whole is insured for public and products liability risks. We believe that these insurance policies are generally in accordance with customary industry practices, including deductibles

<<<

 and limits of cover, but we cannot be fully insured against all potential hazards incident to our business, including losses resulting from risks of war, terrorist acts, riots, coups, uprisings, invasions, annexations or other political or

<<<

 crisis management risks, expropriation, confiscation and forced abandonment, employment practices liability, certain natural hazards (such as earthquakes), cybercrime or other cyber risks, environmental damages (including pollution liabilities

<<<

 and costs for gradual pollution incidents and on-site clean-up costs), or all potential losses, including damage to our reputation. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, or if premiums and deductibles

<<<

 for certain insurance policies were to increase substantially as a result of any incidents for which we are insured, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
52

We are subject to

<<<

 risks from legal proceedings.
We are involved in litigation in the ordinary course of business and could become involved in additional legal and arbitration disputes in the future which may involve substantial claims for damages or other payments

<<<

, including damages claims by customers in connection with past or future product liability claims, tax litigation, violations of antitrust laws, compensation suits by former employees (including for workplace injuries) or compensation owed

<<<

 to former minority shareholders in connection with squeeze-out proceedings. The outcome of currently pending or potential future proceedings is difficult to predict with any certainty. In the event of a negative outcome of any material legal

<<<

 or arbitration proceeding, whether based on a judgment, award or a settlement, we could be obligated to make substantial payments. In addition, the cost related to litigation and arbitration proceedings may be significant.
In 2012 (with respect

<<<

 to 2006) and 2013 (with respect to 2007-2008), the Finnish tax authorities conducted tax reassessments concerning the tax payable by Paroc Oy Ab in respect of the company's transfer pricing practices for intra group pricing of supplies of raw

<<<

 materials, license fees and distributor services during the 2006 to 2008 financial years. Under these tax reassessments, the company is required to pay 22.3 million in taxes and penalties (this amount also includes interest of 5.9 million calculated

<<<

 until December 31, 2013). Because we have a different view as to the correct tax treatment of our transfer pricing practices during that period, we have filed an appeal against the tax reassessment with the Board of Appeals and have not recognized

<<<

 a provision for this potential liability in our financial statements. We have been granted an interdiction of payment, which means that the reassessed taxes are not due until the earlier of the date of the Board of Appeals' decision and January

<<<

 31, 2015. However, if we are unsuccessful in our appeal and the Board of Appeals does not accept our view, absent any successful subsequent appeal by us, we will be liable to pay the reassessed amount, plus additional interest calculated up

<<<

 to the payment date. As we have applied the same transfer pricing practices in respect of the 2009 to 2013, financial years, if our appeal is unsuccessful we may also have to pay additional taxes, penalties and accrued interest, which we estimate

<<<

 may total as much as 16.7 million (comprising additional tax of 12.6 million, plus 2.5 million in penalties and 1.6 million in interest, in respect of those financial years).
In 2012, the Finnish tax authorities also conducted an audit of Paroc

<<<

 Oy Ab's tax return in respect of the financial year ended December 31, 2011 and assessed 7.6 million of additional taxable income on the basis that a deduction had been incorrectly claimed on write-downs of intragroup loans. The authorities

<<<

 also imposed an additional penalty of 370,000, which we have paid. We have appealed this assessment and the penalty, and as a result of the appeal the penalty imposed has been reduced to 800. The Finnish tax authorities have appealed the reduction

<<<

 of the penalty and we have appealed the assessment of additional income as taxable income. The proceedings before the Administrative Court in relation to the matter are currently pending. If the Finnish tax authorities are successful in the

<<<

 pending proceedings before the Administrative Court, we will not receive a refund of the penalty amount paid by us absent any successful subsequent appeal by us.
We are also currently involved in a material dispute arising from our operations

<<<

 in Poland. In 2011, a local authority sought to impose real property taxes for 2009 to 2011 in respect of an investment project at our Trzemeszno production facility in an amount totaling approximately PLN2.2 million more than the amounts declared

<<<

 and paid by us for such taxes. To date we have been unsuccessful in disputing the imposition of these additional taxes in appeals to the Self-Government Appeal Court and Regional Administrative Court in Poznan. We are currently awaiting the

<<<

 outcome of a further appeal to the Supreme Administrative Court. While we await the outcome of our appeal, we have paid this additional tax amount, and have booked a tax receivable for which 100% of the provision is booked.
We are subject to

<<<

 certain competition and antitrust laws.
Our business is subject to applicable competition and antitrust laws, rules and regulations. In general, these laws are designed to preserve free and open competition in the marketplace in order to enhance

<<<

 competitiveness and economic efficiency. While we believe we are generally in compliance with all applicable competition and antitrust laws, rules and regulations we may become subject to investigations and proceedings by national and supranational

<<<

 competition and antitrust authorities for alleged infringements of competition or antitrust laws. This may result in fines or other forms of liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition

<<<

 and results of operations. From 2009 to 2012, there was an investigation by the Finnish Competition Authority on the competition in the Finnish insulation industry. Although this investigation was not related to Paroc specifically, and was

<<<

 closed, the Finnish Competition Authority did indicate that it will continue to monitor
53

the competitive situation in the industry, leaving open the possibility that a new investigation could be opened in the future. Our market shares in

<<<

 certain business segments are relatively high and it is thus possible that competition authorities may find us to hold a dominant market position in one or several relevant markets. If such a finding is made, there is a risk that certain of

<<<

 our sales and distribution policies and agreements could come under competition scrutiny in the various jurisdictions in which we operate, exposing us to the possibility of substantial fines and other restraints on our operations. It is also

<<<

 possible that certain of our procurement arrangements with our suppliers may be subject to competition scrutiny. In the past we have also entered into licensing agreements, some of which remain outstanding, with regard to our intellectual property

<<<

, and as some of these licensing agreements are with competitors, they could potential be the subject of competition scrutiny. Depending on the particular facts and circumstances, we could become subject to certain limitations on future acquisitions

<<<

 and certain business practices if we were found to have obtained a dominant position in certain markets.
The adoption of new or revised International Financial Reporting Standards may have material effects on our future consolidated financial

<<<

 statements.
The International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") comprise IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB"), the International Accounting Standards ("IAS") as well as the interpretations of the International

<<<

 Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (``IFRIC") and the Standing Interpretations Committee ("SIC"). Our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum comply with the IFRS as adopted by the European

<<<

 Union as of the date of such financial statements. The IASB has published or may in the future publish new or amended standards and interpretations, which are not yet effective and have not yet been adopted by the Group in its financial statements

<<<

. See "Note 2--Summary of significant accounting policies--Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective" to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum for

<<<

 more information on new or amended standards and interpretations that have been published by the IASB. The Group will adopt each standard and interpretation from their effective date, or if the effective date is different from the first date

<<<

 of the reporting period, from the start of the next reporting period following the effective date as endorsed by the European Union. The amendments to the standards and interpretations mentioned in "Note 2--Summary of significant accounting

<<<

 policies--Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective" to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum are estimated to primarily impact the presentation

<<<

 in our financial disclosures.
Pending andfuture tax audits within our Group and changes in fiscal regulations or the interpretations thereof could lead to additional tax liabilities.
We operate in many countries, most of which have complex

<<<

 tax regimes. Our corporate structure requires a variety of intercompany services and supplies. Due to the nature of our operations and our significant reorganizations in recent years, our tax affairs and those of our subsidiaries are complex

<<<

. Significant judgment is required in determining provisions for income taxes. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Management judgment is required for the calculation of the provision

<<<

 for income taxes. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current recorded and unrecorded tax provisions in the period in which such determination

<<<

 is made.
The Group and its constituent entities are subject to routine tax audits by the respective local tax authorities. Paroc Oy Ab is currently subject to disputes with the Finnish tax authorities arising from tax audits regarding transfer

<<<

 pricing in financial years 2006 through 2008, and the deductibility of write-downs of intercompany loans in the 2011 financial year. See "-- We are subject to risks from legal proceedings." As the associated litigation has not yet been finalized

<<<

, we cannot exclude that actual tax payment obligations may exceed the amount reflected in our financial statements. Paroc AB was the subject of a general tax audit opened by the Swedish taxation authorities in July 2013. While we have received

<<<

 formal notification that we are not required to pay additional tax and penalties in excess of the amount reflected in our financial statements, we cannot exclude the possibility of further tax audits in the future. Future tax audits in Finland

<<<

 or other jurisdictions may result in additional tax and interest payments which would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Changes in fiscal regulations or the interpretation of tax laws, including regarding

<<<

 transfer pricing, by the courts or the tax authorities in Finland or foreign jurisdictions in which we are conducting our business may also have adverse consequences for us. For example, the Group recently completed a reorganization
54

of

<<<

 the holding structure for the intellectual property previously held by its Finnish entity, Paroc Oy Ab, which will have the effect of transferring all such intellectual property to Paroc Group Oy. Although tax clearance for the reorganization

<<<

, including the proposed post-reorganization transfer pricing methodology, was obtained in advance from the Finnish tax authorities, the Finnish tax authorities have not approved our suggested pricing under that methodology. As the Finnish tax

<<<

 authorities' approach to transfer pricing appears to be in a state of flux, it is possible that our transfer pricing practices in respect of this intellectual property may result in tax and interest payments in excess of the amount currently

<<<

 expected.
In some jurisdictions, such as Russia, tax authorities have broad powers in terms of the application and interpretation of existing laws and the issuance of by-laws. Their position on various issues may change significantly over time

<<<

, which in turn increases the probability of adverse consequences for our business. For example, we are currently involved in a pending dispute with the Russian tax authorities in relation to the refusal by such authorities to permit ZAO Paroc

<<<

 to recover RUB 11.8 million (approximately 262,222) of VAT for the second quarter of 2013 due to insufficient documentation. ZAO Paroc expects to receive similar VAT recovery refusals for the third and fourth quarters of 2013 for the amount

<<<

 of RUB 9.2 million (approximately 204,444) and RUB 20 million (approximately 444,444), respectively. ZAO Paroc plans to settle this issue with the Russian tax authorities out-of-court by providing a revised tax return with complete documentation

<<<

. Non-residents are also exposed to the risk of cancellations of or amendments to double taxation treaties, which in turn may affect such an investor's position if they previously derived benefits from such treaties. Over the last 20 years,

<<<

 the Russian taxation system has been subject to frequent, arbitrary and radical changes and the system will likely continue to change. Therefore, we are unable to confidently predict the impact of the Russian taxation system on our activities

<<<

 in Russia, though it is possible that it may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.
Due to restrictions on the deduction of interest expenses orforfeiture of interest carry-forwards under

<<<

 Finnish and Swedish law, we may be unable to fully deduct interest expenses on our financial liabilities.
A certain amount of our Group's annual financing expenses (interest payments) may not be deductible under Finnish or Swedish taxation

<<<

 laws. Subject to certain prerequisites, these laws impose certain restrictions on the deductibility of interest for tax purposes. Most relevantly, new interest deduction limitation rules were introduced in Sweden with effect on and from January

<<<

 1, 2013, pursuant to which interest payments to affiliated companies are not deductible unless an exemption applies. These exemptions are essentially that either (i) the interest income would have been taxed at a minimum rate of 10% in the

<<<

 residence state of the beneficial owner thereof, assuming that such income were its only income, unless the main reason for the loan structure is to obtain a substantial tax benefit, or (ii) the loan (as well as the acquisition, if the loan

<<<

 relates to an acquisition of shares from an affiliated party or shares in a company that will become affiliated further to the acquisition), are motivated by business reasons, and the recipient of the interest is resident in another EEA country

<<<

 or a country which has a tax treaty with Sweden. At present, there is a SEK-denominated intercompany loan outstanding between Paroc Sverige AB and Paroc Group which, as of December 31, 2013, had a book value of 225.8 million, and in respect

<<<

 of which the interest expense in the stand-alone financial statements of Paroc Sverige AB for the year ended December 31, 2013 was 10.5 million. It is possible that we may be denied a deduction for this interest expense, which may result in

<<<

 additional tax liabilities in respect of the 2013 financial year in the order of 2.2 million, plus penalties of 0.9 million. We may also not be able to claim a deduction for interest expenses in respect of this loan, or any similar loans replacing

<<<

 or refinancing this loan, for the 2014 financial year or future financial years. If we are unable to claim a deduction for this loan, or any similar loans replacing or refinancing this loan, in respect of any financial year, this may have a

<<<

 material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In this context, it should be noted that a committee has been appointed by the Swedish government to carry out a general review of the Swedish corporate

<<<

 tax system. The committee has a specific instruction to propose rules making it more neutral to invest in equity compared to debt and to contemplate and propose legislation to further restrict deductions on interest payments. At this stage

<<<

 it is uncertain what the outcome of this will be (the committee is to submit its final report in June, 2014), The restriction of the deductibility of interest expenses for tax purposes may have adverse consequences for our financial condition

<<<

 and results of operations.
In Finland, new interest deduction limitation rules were introduced in 2013 and are applicable from the 2014 tax year. The rules considerably limit the ability to deduct interest expenses paid between affiliated companies

<<<

. According to the rules, net interest expenses may become non-deductible if they exceed 500,000 per tax year. If the 500,000 limit is exceeded, the net interest expenses can still be deducted to
55

the extent that they do not exceed 25% of

<<<

 the company's adjusted EBITDA. For the purposes of the calculation of the 25% limit, both interest on associated loans and third party loans are taken into account, while the deductibility of interest on associated loans may only be lost. The

<<<

 new rules include a solvency test based on which otherwise non-deductible net interest cost may become deductible. According to the solvency test, net interest expenses are always deductible if the taxpayer provides evidence that the ratio

<<<

 of the equity of the taxpayer to the balance sheet total is not below the corresponding ratio of the group balance sheet in the end of the tax year. Any non-deductible amount is carried forward and may be, again subject to the interest barrier

<<<

 rules, deductible in future fiscal years. The restriction of the deductibility of interest expenses for tax purposes may have adverse consequences for our financial condition and results of operations in the future.
Restrictions on the utilization

<<<

 of our tax loss carry-forwards may have an adverse effect on ourfinancial condition and results of operations.
Certain companies in our corporate structure have tax loss carry-forwards of which the tax effect has partially been capitalized

<<<

 as deferred tax assets in the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2013. The Group reviews at each balance sheet date the carrying amount of deferred tax assets. The Group considers whether it is probable

<<<

 that the group entities will have sufficient taxable profits against which the unused tax losses or unused tax credits can be utilized. The factors used in estimates may differ from actual outcome which could lead to significant adjustments

<<<

 to deferred tax assets expensed in the statement of income. The net operating loss carry-forwards for which no deferred tax asset is recognized due to uncertainty of their utilization amounted to 8.4 million at December 31, 2013 for the Paroc

<<<

 Group, and does not include significant tax loss carry-forwards at our parent company, Safari Finco 1 Oy. These losses for the Paroc Group expire between the years 2019 - 2023. In general, in Finland, tax losses may be carried forward for 

<<<

10 years and set off against income from the same source in which the loss was incurred, assuming certain conditions are met. According to Finnish rules, if more than 50% of the share capital is transferred, tax loss carry-forwards and current

<<<

 losses will be forfeited unless a dispensation is granted. In addition, in Finland the ability to make group contributions to passive holding companies may be restricted, which could potentially limit our ability to utilize tax losses in our

<<<

 corporate structure, including at Safari Finco 1 Oy. To the extent that the utilization of tax losses is restricted, they cannot be set-off against future tax profits which would result in increased future tax burdens. In addition, any such

<<<

 restriction may require a write-down of the deferred tax assets in our consolidated financial statements. This could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.
Certain of our customers have been expanding and may continue

<<<

 to expand through consolidation and internal growth, which may increase their buyingpower, which could materially and adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial position.
Certain of our important customers in certain

<<<

 markets are large companies with significant buying power. In addition, potential further consolidation in the distribution channels could enhance the ability of certain of our customers to seek more favorable terms, including pricing, for

<<<

 the products that they purchase from us. A tendency toward dealer consolidation and therefore increased customer bargaining power is a risk, especially in the dealer segment. Accordingly, our ability to maintain or raise prices in the future

<<<

 may be limited, including during periods of raw material and other cost increases. See "--Our business may be negatively affected by volatility in raw and other material prices, our inability to retain or replace our key suppliers, unexpected

<<<

 supply shortages and disruptions of the supply chain' If we are forced to reduce prices or to maintain prices during periods of increased costs, or if we lose customers because of pricing or other methods of competition, our revenues, operating

<<<

 results and financial position may be materially and adversely affected.
Because to a certain extent we depend on a coregroup ofsignificant customers, our sales, cashflowsfrom operations and results of operations may decline if our key customers

<<<

 reduce the amount ofproducts that they purchasefrom us.
Our top 10 customers accounted for 31%, 37% and 19% of our gross external sales in our BI, TI and PPS divisions, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2013. We expect a small number

<<<

 of customers to continue to account for a not insignificant portion of our net sales for these divisions for the foreseeable future. By contrast, in our Russian operations, our top 10 customers accounted for 50% of our gross external sales

<<<

 in the year ended December 31, 2013, and a small number of customers may continue to account for a substantial portion of our net sales for this business unit for the foreseeable future.
56

The loss of, or a significant adverse change in

<<<

 our relationships with, our major customers, or a loss of market position of any major customer, could cause a decrease in our sales. The loss of, or a reduction in orders from, any significant customers, losses arising from customers' disputes

<<<

 regarding shipments, fees, merchandise condition or related matters, or our inability to collect accounts receivable from any major retail customer could cause a decrease in our net income and our cash flows. In addition, revenue from customers

<<<

 that have accounted for significant revenue in past periods, individually or as a group, may not continue, or if continued, may not reach or exceed historical levels in any period.
Increases in union organizing activity and work stoppages at

<<<

 ourfacilities or thefacilities of our suppliers could delay or impede our production, reduce sales of our products and increase our costs.
Our financial performance is affected by the cost of labor. As of December 31, 2013, we estimate that

<<<

 in Finland, approximately 98% of our blue collar and 85% of our white collar employees were represented by labor unions, in Sweden, approximately 95% of our blue collar and 75% of our white collar employees were represented by labor unions

<<<

, in Poland, approximately 40% of our blue collar and 20% of our white collar employees were represented by labor unions and in Lithuania, 15% of our blue collar employees were represented by labor unions. There is currently no unionization

<<<

 at our Russian facility. We are subject to the risk that strikes or other types of conflicts with personnel may arise or that we may become a subject of union organizing activity. There are collective bargaining agreements in place in our operations

<<<

 in Finland, Sweden and Lithuania. In Poland, we have a set of "Regulations" related to, for example, remuneration, which have been drafted according to the Polish Labor Code, issued by Paroc Polska Sp. z o.o. and approved by the trade unions

<<<

 active in Paroc Polska Sp. z o.o. Furthermore, some of our direct and indirect suppliers have unionized work forces. Strikes, work stoppages or slowdowns experienced by these suppliers could result in insufficient supply of the raw materials

<<<

 we need to produce our stone wool products. In the past, we have had disputes with unions operating in our Polish operations, which in 2011 were ultimately settled amicably. We could in the future have disputes with the unions operating in

<<<

 our organization. Any interruption in the production or delivery of our products could reduce sales of our products and increase our costs.
Our ability to operate and ourgrowthpotential could be materially and adversely affected if we cannot

<<<

 employ, train and retain qualified personnel at a competitive cost.
Many of the products that we manufacture and assemble require manual processes in plant environments. We believe that our success depends upon our ability to attract, employ

<<<

, train and retain qualified personnel with the ability to design, manufacture and assemble these products. In addition, our ability to expand our operations depends in part on our ability to increase our skilled labor force as the housing market

<<<

 recovers in our core Nordic markets. A significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction of our qualified labor force, increases in the wage rates that we must pay, or both, particularly in the emerging

<<<

 markets in which we operate. In addition, our ability to quickly and effectively train additional workforce to handle the increased volume and production while minimizing labor inefficiencies and maintaining product quality will be a strategic

<<<

 initiative in a housing market recovery. If either of these events were to occur, our cost structure could increase, our margins could decrease, and any growth potential could be impaired.
We may not be able to effectively predict or react

<<<

 to rapid technological changes that could render our products obsolete.
The emergence of new technologies is driving rapid change in some of the Group's markets. The Group has to keep pace with these changes and integrate the new technologies

<<<

 in its product offer, in order to respond effectively to customers' needs. This requires spending on research and development, with no guaranteed return on investment. The Group's sales and operating margin may be affected if it fails to invest

<<<

 in appropriate technologies or to rapidly bring new products to market, or if competing products are introduced or the Group's new products do not adequately respond to customers' needs. This could in turn have a material adverse effect on

<<<

 the Group's financial position and results.
Changes in distribution channels may adversely affect our sales volume and profitability, and new distribution channels may have lower margins and reduce our profitability.
Distribution of insulation

<<<

 materials is generally made via dealers or other intermediaries or by direct sales to end users. Panels are generally sold directly to end users, other than in Russia. Direct sales typically have lower margins. If direct sales channels gain

<<<

 greater importance in the future, we may lose market share or
57

our margins may decline, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
In addition, in recent years, the trend towards the increasing

<<<

 use of the internet as a source of information has generally resulted in greater levels of price transparency. However, the share of the internet as a sales channel is still limited in our industry. Although we do not believe that the internet

<<<

 has had a material impact on our sales or margins to date, we cannot assure you that this will not change in the future. We have seen an increasing tendency toward dealer consolidation, which could increase customer bargaining power and lower

<<<

 margins if dealers start to demand lower prices, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We may be affected by changes of approach or existing practices by governmental authorities or courts

<<<

 in certain countries with respect to the interpretation of unclear or ambiguous provisions of laws
In certain countries, like Poland and, to some extent, Russia, a number of provisions of the laws, including in relation to taxation, applicable

<<<

 to our operations and the way we finance them are unclear or ambiguous and, therefore, we are exposed to the risk of unfavorable administrative or judicial interpretations thereof. Moreover, the past and current practices of governmental authorities

<<<

, courts and other parties in regarding or interpreting our actions, or actions of third parties, as effective and valid may be altered, which could result in a negative impact on our business, financial position and results of operations. In

<<<

 particular, certain agreements we have entered into in relation to the acquisition of part of the real property on which our manufacturing facilities in Trzemeszno are located may be declared invalid or ineffective due to the fact that at the

<<<

 time of closing such acquisitions we relied on permits issued by the Polish Ministry of Internal Affairs which might not have been fully effective as at the time of closing. This may affect our title to our land and the facilities we have constructed

<<<

 thereon; at worst, if in the event of a dispute no agreement is reached with the legal successor of the vendor of the relevant real property in Trzemeszno and our real property interests are not recognized by a court, we may be forced to move

<<<

 our Polish manufacturing facilities to another location, relinquish the relevant real property to the legal successor of the vendor, pay damages to the legal successor of the vendor, or offset the cost of our investments in the facilities against

<<<

 damages payable by us to the vendor's successor. Our ultimate recovery, if any, in such circumstances may be less than the cost of our investments in the facilities. This can have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position

<<<

 and results of operations. See "--Interruptions in operations at our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. ''
We may not realize any or all ofour anticipated

<<<

 cost savings andproductivity andefficiency gains with respect to our cost savings programs.
This offering memorandum includes estimates and assumptions, including some that are related to the implementation of cost savings programs. These cost

<<<

 savings programs include productivity, efficiency and selling, general and administrative expense ("SG&A") programs, including an energy efficiency project, a consumption optimization project, a packaging improvement project, a maintenance

<<<

 saving program (involving the centralization of maintenance and repair processes), a reduction in headcount (mainly indirect, finance/accounting), a finance transformation project wherein a financial service center was established in Vilnius

<<<

, Lithuania and the business controlling organization was reorganized, among other programs. The estimates contained herein involve risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements

<<<

 to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied.
We may not be able to obtain the anticipated benefit of our cost savings programs. In addition, any cost savings that we realize may be offset

<<<

, in whole or in part, by temporary or permanent reductions in revenues, or through increases in other expenses, including expenses incurred in connection with the implementation of cost savings programs.
Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure

<<<


Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business and preclude us from satisfying our obligations under our debt, including the Notes and the Note Guarantees.
We have a substantial amount

<<<

 of outstanding indebtedness. As of December 31, 2013, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, we would have had total financial liabilities of 431.8 million (which represents the aggregate principal amount of the Notes offered hereby

<<<

, together with finance lease
58

liabilities), of which 430.0 million constituted senior secured indebtedness. As of the same date, we also would have had the ability to incur significant additional financial indebtedness under our New Revolving

<<<

 Credit Facility.
Our significant leverage could continue for the foreseeable future and the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences to our business and the holders of the Notes, including, but not limited to:
 limiting

<<<

 our ability to obtain additional funding for future capital expenditure, working capital requirements, debt service requirements, acquisitions, and other general corporate requirements;
 requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our

<<<

 cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditure, acquisitions, and other general corporate requirements;
 limiting our flexibility in planning

<<<

 for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we operate;
 increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business or in economic conditions generally;
 placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared with our

<<<

 competitors, to the extent that they are not as highly leveraged or have greater financial resources;
 exposing us to increases in interest rates with respect to our floating rate debt instruments, such as the New Revolving Credit Facility

<<<

 and the Floating Rate Notes; and
 making it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations, including those with respect to the Notes.
Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability

<<<

 to satisfy our debt obligations, including the Notes.
Despite our current level of indebtedness, we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in thefuture which may make it difficult for us to service our debt, including the

<<<

 Notes.
We may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, including up to 60.0 million under our New Revolving Credit Facility, which will be secured on a pari passu basis with the Notes. Although the New Revolving Credit

<<<

 Facility and the Indenture will contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances the amount of indebtedness

<<<

 that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial and we may be able to secure such additional indebtedness with the Collateral or other assets. Certain creditors in respect of our debt, including lenders under

<<<

 our New Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging obligations will receive proceeds from the enforcement of security granted over the Collateral prior to the holders of the Notes. If new indebtedness is added to our existing

<<<

 debt levels, the related risks that we now face would increase. In addition, the Indenture and the New Revolving Credit Facility will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements.
Furthermore

<<<

, some of the debt that we incur in the future could be structurally senior to the Notes and may be secured by collateral that does not secure the Notes. In particular, our non-Guarantor subsidiaries may incur substantial additional indebtedness

<<<

 in the future, further increasing the risks associated with our substantial leverage. If any of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries incur additional indebtedness, the holders of that debt will be entitled to share ahead of you in any proceeds distributed

<<<

 in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding-up of such subsidiaries. See "--The Notes will be structurally subordinated to present and future liabilities of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries."
We

<<<

 may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt and sustain our operations. Our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors beyond our control.
Our ability to make payments on, or repay or refinance, our debt

<<<

, including the Notes, and to fund future capital expenditure and other cash needs will depend largely upon our future operating performance. Our future performance, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive

<<<

, legislative, regulatory, technical and other factors, including those discussed in these "Risk Factors," that are beyond our control. In addition, our ability to borrow funds in the future to make payments on our debt will depend on the satisfaction

<<<

 of the covenants in our New Revolving Credit Facility, the Indenture and our other debt agreements, as well as any other agreements we may enter into in the future. We cannot assure
59

you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow

<<<

 from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt, including the Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs. See ``Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

<<<

 and Results of Operations--Liquidity and Capital Resources." In addition, prior to the repayment in full of the Notes, we will be required to refinance or repay certain other debt, including debt under the New Revolving Credit Facility. We

<<<

 cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance or repay any of our indebtedness, including the Notes, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates than our current debt

<<<

 and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. If we are unable to make payments or refinance our indebtedness or obtain new financing under these circumstances, we would have

<<<

 to consider other options, such as:  sell assets or equity;  reduce or delay our business activities and any capital expenditures;  restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity;  forego

<<<

 opportunities such as acquisitions of other businesses; or  negotiate with our lenders to restructure the applicable debt. If we are not able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on commercially reasonable terms, or

<<<

 at all, we may not be able to satisfy our debt obligations. Any failure to raise additional funds necessary to service our debt on a timely basis could result in a default under our debt, including under the New Revolving Credit Facility and

<<<

 the Notes. This in turn would also likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could adversely affect our ability to incur additional indebtedness. An event of default under any of these circumstances could result in:  holders

<<<

 of our indebtedness declaring all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable;  the lenders under our New Revolving Credit Facility being able to terminate their commitments to
lend us money and foreclose against the Collateral

<<<

 securing their borrowings; and  our being forced into bankruptcy or liquidation, which could result in you losing your investment in
the Notes.
Restrictive covenants in the New Revolving Credit Facility and the Indenture may restrict our ability

<<<

 to operate our business. Ourfailure to comply with these covenants, including as a result ofevents beyond our control, couldresult in an event of default that could materially and adversely affect ourfinancial condition and results of operations

<<<

. The Indenture and the New Revolving Credit Facility will contain, among other things, certain provisions which may restrict our ability to:  incur additional debt and issue guarantees and preferred stock;  create or incur certain liens;

<<<


 make certain payments, including dividends and other distributions, with respect to outstanding share capital;
 repay or redeem subordinated debt or share capital;  create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts from the

<<<

 Issuer and its restricted
subsidiaries;  make certain investments, loans or other restricted payments;  sell, lease or transfer certain assets, including shares of any restricted subsidiary of the Issuer;
 engage in certain transactions

<<<

 with affiliates;  guarantee certain types of other indebtedness of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries without also
guaranteeing the Notes;  expand into unrelated businesses;  impair the security interests granted over the Collateral

<<<

; and  effect a merger or consolidation of, or sell all or substantially all of, the assets of the Issuer and its
restricted subsidiaries.
60

All of these limitations are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. In addition,

<<<

 the New Revolving Credit Facility also requires us to satisfy financial condition tests provided for in the New Revolving Credit Facility. See ``Description of Other Indebtedness--New Revolving Credit Facility."
Our ability to comply with the

<<<

 covenants and restrictions under the Indenture and the New Revolving Credit Facility and under other agreements governing our indebtedness may be affected by events beyond our control. These include prevailing political, economic, financial

<<<

 and industry conditions.
The covenants in the Indenture and the New Revolving Credit Facility and any future indebtedness may significantly restrict our future operations and our ability to react to market conditions or take advantage of potential

<<<

 business opportunities as they arise. If there were an event of default under any of the agreements relating to our outstanding debt, including from the Issue Date the Indenture, and from the date of its execution (if earlier) the New Revolving

<<<

 Credit Facility, which was not cured or waived during any applicable grace period, the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately. We cannot assure you that

<<<

 our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments, including the Notes, if accelerated upon an event of default. Further, if we are unable to repay, refinance or restructure our secured

<<<

 debt, the holders of such debt could proceed against the Collateral securing that debt in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. In addition, any event of default or declaration of acceleration under one debt instrument

<<<

 could also result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt instruments.
The New Revolving Credit Facility and the Floating Rate Notes will bear interest at a floating rate that could rise significantly, increasing our interest

<<<

 cost and debt and reducing our cash flow.
The New Revolving Credit Facility and the Floating Rate Notes will bear interest at a floating rate of interest which could rise significantly in the future. Although we may enter into and maintain

<<<

 certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no assurances that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need

<<<

 to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. To the extent interest rates were to rise significantly, our interest expense associated with the New Revolving Credit Facility and the Floating Rate Notes

<<<

 and the carrying cost of our indebtedness would correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow.
Creditors under the New Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging liabilities are entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of the Collateral

<<<

 sold in any enforcement sale prior to the holders of the Notes.
The obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees are secured, subject to certain exceptions, on a contractual first-ranking basis with security interests over the Collateral

<<<

 that also secures our obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations on a pari passu basis. The Indenture also permits the Collateral to be pledged to secure additional indebtedness, including on a contractual

<<<

 first-ranking basis in accordance with the terms thereof and the Intercreditor Agreement. The Security Agent will act on behalf of the lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, certain hedge counterparties, the trustee for

<<<

 the Notes and holders of the Notes. See "-- The holders of the Notes may not control decisions regarding the Collateral."
Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the liabilities under the New Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations

<<<

 will have priority over the Notes with respect to the proceeds from the enforcement of the security granted over the Collateral. See `Description of Other Indebtedness-- IntercreditorAgreement" As a result, the claims of the holders of the

<<<

 Notes will be effectively subordinated to the rights of our existing and future secured creditors who have priority in respect of proceeds from enforcement of the liens over assets that constitute Collateral to the extent of the value of such

<<<

 assets. In the event we are subject to any foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, reorganization, administration or other bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding, lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedge counterparties

<<<

 and the holders of any other such super-priority debt will receive payment in respect of their obligations prior to any payments in respect of the Notes. As a result, holders of Notes may receive less than holders of such super-priority secured

<<<

 indebtedness, or may not recover amounts at all.
We will be permitted to borrow additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the terms of the Indenture and the New Revolving Credit Facility, and we may secure such indebtedness, including

<<<

 in certain cases, on
61

a super priority basis. Our ability to incur additional debt in the future secured on the Collateral may have the effect of diluting the ratio of the value of such Collateral to the aggregate amount of the obligations

<<<

 secured by the Collateral.
The claims ofthe holders ofthe Notes will be effectively subordinated to the rights ofour existing andfuture secured creditors to the extent of the value of the assets securing such creditors which do not also secure

<<<

 the Notes.
The claims of any secured creditors which are secured by assets that do not also secure the Notes will have priority with respect to such assets over the claims of holders of the Notes. As such, the claims of the holders of the Notes

<<<

 will be effectively subordinated to the rights of such secured creditors to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness.
You may be unable to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities laws violations.
The Issuer

<<<

, the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries are organized outside of the United States. It is anticipated that all of the directors and executive officers of the Issuer and the Guarantors will be non-residents of the United States and

<<<

 that the majority of their assets will be located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon the Issuer, the Guarantors or their respective directors

<<<

 and executive officers, or to enforce any judgments obtained in U.S. courts predicated upon civil liability provisions of the U.S. securities laws. Additionally, there is doubt as to the enforceability in many foreign jurisdictions of civil

<<<

 liabilities based on the civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States against the Issuer, the Guarantors, the directors, controlling persons and management and any experts named in this offering memorandum

<<<

 who are not residents of the United States. See "Service of Process and Enforcement of civil liabilities."
The Issuer is primarily a holding company that conducts substantially all of its operations through its subsidiaries and will depend

<<<

 on receivingpayments or distributionsfrom its subsidiaries to meet its obligations under the Notes.
The Issuer is primarily a holding company that conducts substantially all of its operations through its direct and indirect subsidiaries. Consequently

<<<

, it will be dependent upon payments from its subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including under the Notes. In addition, because certain of the Guarantors are also holding companies, the ability of these Guarantors to make payments on their

<<<

 guarantees will be dependent on the same factors.
The ability of the Issuer's subsidiaries to make payments to it to fund payments on the Notes will depend upon their cash flows and earnings which, in turn, will be affected by all of the factors

<<<

 discussed in these "Risk Factors' and elsewhere in this offering memorandum.
The payment of dividends and the making, or repayment, of loans and advances to the Issuer by the Issuer's direct subsidiaries and such payments by its indirect subsidiaries

<<<

 to their respective parent entities are subject to various restrictions. Existing and future indebtedness of certain of these subsidiaries may prohibit the payment of dividends or the making, or repayment, of loans or advances to the Issuer

<<<

 or its parent entities. In addition, the ability of any of the Issuer's direct or indirect subsidiaries to make certain distributions may be limited by the laws of the relevant jurisdiction in which the subsidiaries are organized or located

<<<

, including financial assistance rules, corporate benefit laws, liquidity requirements, requirements that dividends must be paid out of reserves available for distribution and other legal restrictions which, if violated, might require the recipient

<<<

 to refund unlawful payments.
Although the Indenture will limit the ability of the Issuer's subsidiaries to enter into future consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends and make other payments to the Issuer, there are significant

<<<

 qualifications and exceptions to these limitations. We cannot assure you that arrangements with the Issuer's subsidiaries and the funding permitted by the agreements governing existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer's subsidiaries will

<<<

 provide the Issuer with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans to fund payments on the Notes when due. See "Description of Other Indebtedness" and "Description of the Notes."
If our operating subsidiaries do not distribute sufficient

<<<

 cash to the Issuer to make scheduled payments on the Notes, we do not expect the Issuer to have any other source of funds that would allow it to make payments to the holders of the Notes.
62

The Notes will be structurally subordinated to

<<<

 present andfuture liabilities of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries.
Not all of our subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. Generally, claims of creditors of a non-Guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors and claims of preference shareholders

<<<

 (if any) of the subsidiary, will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiary over the claims of creditors of its parent entity, including claims by holders of the Notes under the applicable Note Guarantee. In the

<<<

 event of any foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, administration, reorganization or other insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding of any of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries, holders of their indebtedness and their trade creditors will

<<<

 generally be entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of those subsidiaries before any assets are made available for distribution to its parent entity. Consequently, the Notes and the Note Guarantees will each be structurally subordinated

<<<

 to the creditors (including trade creditors) and preference shareholders (if any) of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries. Further, the enforceability and scope of Note Guarantees granted by our Guarantor subsidiaries may be limited due to statutory

<<<

 restrictions (relating to, for example, corporate benefit and prohibited financial assistance) applying in the jurisdiction of the relevant Guarantor and to the extent of such limitations, the Notes and the Note Guarantees may each be structurally

<<<

 subordinated to the creditors (including trade creditors) and preference shareholders (if any) of our Guarantor subsidiaries or, in certain jurisdictions, rendered invalid and unenforceable. Although our non-Guarantor subsidiaries currently

<<<

 represent only a portion of our revenues and EBITDA, the covenants in the Indenture and New Revolving Credit Facility permit us to incur additional indebtedness at subsidiaries which do not guarantee the Notes and in the future the revenues

<<<

 and EBITDA of such entities could increase, possibly substantially.
The security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders ofthe Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce

<<<

 certain of the Collateral may be restricted by local law.
The security interests in the Collateral that will secure our obligations under the Notes and the obligations of the Guarantors under the Note Guarantees will not be granted directly

<<<

 to the holders of the Notes but will be granted only in favor of the Security Agent. The Trustee will enter into the Intercreditor Agreement with, among others, the Security Agent and representatives of the other indebtedness secured by the

<<<

 Collateral, including the New Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging obligations. Other creditors may become parties to the Intercreditor Agreement in the future. Among other things, the Intercreditor Agreement governs

<<<

 the enforcement of the Security Documents, and will provide that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, only the Security Agent has the right to enforce the Security Documents relating to the Collateral on behalf of the Trustee and the

<<<

 holders of the Notes, the sharing in any recoveries from such enforcement and the release of the Collateral by the Security Agent. As a consequence, holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take

<<<

 enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Security Agent, who will follow instructions as set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement. For more information, see `Description of Other Indebtedness--Intercreditor

<<<

 Agreement--Release of the Guarantees and the Security--Distressed Disposal" and "Certain Insolvency Law and Local Law Limitations.''
In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests in the Collateral is subject

<<<

 to mandatory provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over the Collateral are taken. For example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for an appropriation of certain pledged assets, but require a sale

<<<

 through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply. There is some uncertainty under the laws of certain jurisdictions as to whether obligations to beneficial owners of the Notes that are not identified as registered holders in a

<<<

 Security Document will be validly secured. In addition, the foreclosure of the pledged items in Poland as a part of an enforcement action may turn out to be ineffective if the foreclosure value does not correspond to the fair market value of

<<<

 the assets.
There is some uncertainty under the laws of certain jurisdictions, including the laws of Poland and Lithuania, as to whether trusts, including the security trust created pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, will be recognized

<<<

 and enforceable. To address this uncertainty, a direct covenant to pay (the ``Parallel Debt") has been granted to the Security Agent by each debtor under the Intercreditor Agreement, including each Guarantor of the Notes. The Parallel Debt

<<<

 provision allows the Security Agent to act in its own name in its capacity as a creditor. The Parallel Debt is an obligation under the Intercreditor Agreement to pay to the Security Agent amounts equal to any amounts owing from time to time

<<<

 by that debtor to any secured party under the debt documents, including the relevant Notes and the Notes Guarantees (the "Principal Obligations"). The Parallel Debt is a separate obligation of each respective debtor to the Security Agent and

<<<

 independent from the corresponding Principal Obligations. The Parallel Debt provisions constitute a secured obligation for the purposes of each Security Document securing the
63

Notes and the other indebtedness secured subject to the Intercreditor

<<<

 Agreement. Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. In respect of the security

<<<

 interests granted to the Security Agent (including to secure the Parallel Debt), the relevant Trustee and the holders of the relevant Notes do not have direct security and are not entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security

<<<

, except through the Security Agent. As a result, the holders of Notes bear some risks associated with the security trust and Parallel Debt structure. Moreover, although the Polish legal system does not provide for the formal legal institution

<<<

 of Parallel Debt, Polish courts' rulings (only limited judicial guidance is available) have generally accepted the parallel debt mechanism and, consequently, also the Polish security for repayment of such debt. However, this position may change

<<<

 in the future and the existence of a parallel debt alongside the primary debt may be found as contradicting Polish legal order. Similarly, the concept of parallel debt is not native to Lithuanian law and thus the Parallel Debt may be subject

<<<

 to uncertainties as to validity and enforceability in Lithuania. See "Certain Insolvency Law and Local Law Limitations. ''
The Issuer and the Guarantors have control over the Collateral securing the Notes and the sale ofparticular assets could

<<<

 reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes.
The Security Documents (except certain Security Documents subject to Swedish law) will, subject to the terms of the New Revolving Credit Facility and the Indenture, allow the Issuer and the Guarantors

<<<

, as applicable, to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income from the Collateral. So long as no default or event of default under the New Revolving Credit Facility

<<<

 or the Indenture would result therefrom, the Issuer and the Guarantors may, among other things, without any release or consent by the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the Collateral, such as selling, factoring

<<<

, abandoning or otherwise disposing of Collateral and making ordinary course cash payments, including repayments of indebtedness. Any of these activities could reduce the value of the Collateral and consequently the amounts payable to you from

<<<

 proceeds of any sale of Collateral in the case of an enforcement of the liens.
The Security Documents further provide for the perfection of security taken over certain Collateral in Sweden and Finland only upon the occurrence of certain specified

<<<

 enforcement events. In certain jurisdictions (including Finland, Sweden, Poland and Lithuania) a valid and enforceable security interest will not be deemed to have been effectively created until it is duly perfected and perfection will not

<<<

 be possible (or normally not be possible in Sweden) to achieve once insolvency proceedings have been commenced. Security may also be susceptible to recovery if granted or perfected within a certain critical time before the commencement of,

<<<

 for example, insolvency proceedings. Further, the enforceability and scope of security created under Security Documents may be limited due to statutory restrictions (relating to, among other things, corporate benefit and prohibited financial

<<<

 assistance) applying in the jurisdiction of the relevant security provider. All of the above could reduce the value of the Collateral and consequently the amounts payable to you from proceeds of any sale of Collateral in the case of enforcement

<<<

. See ``Certain Insolvency Law and Local Law Limitations.''
No appraisals ofany ofthe Collateral have beenprepared by us or on our behalfin connection with the issuance of the Notes. The Notes will be secured only to the extent ofthe value ofthe

<<<

 Collateral that has been granted as security for the Notes and the Note Guarantees,and the value ofthe Collateral securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations thereunder and such Collateral may

<<<

 be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances.
The Notes and the Note Guarantees will be secured by security interests in the Collateral as described in this offering memorandum, which Collateral also secures the obligations under the New

<<<

 Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations. The Collateral may also secure additional indebtedness to the extent permitted by the terms of the Indenture, the New Revolving Credit Facility and the Intercreditor Agreement. Your

<<<

 rights to the Collateral may be diluted by any increase in the indebtedness secured by the Collateral on a pari passu basis with the Notes. To the extent that other first-ranking security interests, pre-existing liens, liens permitted under

<<<

 the Indenture and other rights encumber the Collateral securing the Notes, those parties may have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral that could adversely affect the value of the security and the ability of the

<<<

 Security Agent (in each case in accordance with the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement) to realize or foreclose on the security. In addition, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the liabilities under the New Revolving Credit

<<<

 Facility and certain hedging obligations will have priority over the Notes with respect to the
64

proceeds from the enforcement of the security granted over the Collateral. As a result, holders of Notes may receive less than holders of such

<<<

 super-priority secured indebtedness, or may not recover amounts at all. See ``--Creditors under the New Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging liabilities are entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of the Collateral sold in any enforcement

<<<

 sale prior to the holders of the N otes'
No appraisal of the fair market value of the Collateral has been made in connection with this Offering. The book value of the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such

<<<

 assets. The value of the Collateral could be impaired in the future as a result of changing economic and market conditions, our failure to successfully implement our business strategy, competition and other factors. The Collateral may include

<<<

 intangible or other illiquid assets that by their nature may not have a readily ascertainable market value, whose value to other parties may be less than its value to us, or may not be readily saleable or, if saleable, there may be substantial

<<<

 delays in their liquidation. In addition, the value of the Collateral may decrease because of obsolescence, impairment or certain casualty events.
In the event of a liquidation, insolvency, foreclosure, bankruptcy, reorganization or similar

<<<

 proceeding, the value of the Collateral and the amount that may be received upon a sale of Collateral will depend upon many factors including, among other things, the condition of the Collateral and our industry, the ability to sell the Collateral

<<<

 in an orderly sale, market and economic conditions, whether the business is sold as a going concern, the availability of buyers and other factors. In addition, courts could limit recoverability with respect to the Collateral if they deem a

<<<

 portion of the interest claim usurious in violation of applicable public policy. As a result, liquidating the Collateral may not produce proceeds in an amount sufficient to pay any amounts due on the Notes. We cannot assure you of the value

<<<

 of the Collateral or that the net proceeds received upon a liquidation, foreclosure, bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding would be sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes.
If the proceeds of Collateral were not sufficient

<<<

 to repay amounts outstanding under the Notes, then holders of the Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would only have an unsecured claim against our remaining assets.
We cannot assure you that the

<<<

 Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, there may be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. Not all of our assets will secure the Notes and the value of the Collateral may not be sufficient to cover the amount of debt secured by

<<<

 such Collateral. There is no requirement under the Indenture to provide funds to enhance the value of the Collateral if it is insufficient, though applicable law may provide otherwise. With respect to any shares of our subsidiaries pledged

<<<

 to secure the Notes and the Note Guarantees, such shares may also have limited value in the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, winding-up or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity's shares that have been pledged because

<<<

 all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not

<<<

 recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the value of the Collateral may decline over time.
The Indenture will permit the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the Security Agent on the Collateral

<<<

. To the extent that holders of other secured debt or third parties enjoy liens, including statutory liens, such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to our or the Guarantors' shares that, if exercised, could reduce

<<<

 the proceeds available to satisfy our obligations under the Notes. Moreover, if additional Notes are issued under the Indenture, holders of such additional Notes would benefit from the same Collateral as the holders of the relevant Notes being

<<<

 offered hereby, thereby diluting your ability to benefit from the Collateral for such Notes.
The holders of the Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral.
Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent has

<<<

 been appointed to act as a common security agent for the secured parties under the New Revolving Credit Facility, the Notes, the Note Guarantees and certain hedging arrangements with regard to the Collateral (as applicable). The Intercreditor

<<<

 Agreement provides that the Security Agent will, subject to certain limited exceptions, act to enforce the security interests in the Collateral and take instructions from the relevant secured creditors in respect of the Collateral only at the

<<<

 direction of the ``instructing group.''
The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the Security Agent shall act upon the instructions of the ``Senior Secured Instructing Group'', which is comprised of (a) the holders of more than 662/3%

<<<

 of the aggregate of all outstanding liabilities under the New Revolving Credit Facility and the super senior hedging liabilities (the ``Majority Super Senior Creditors'') and (b) the holders of Notes and holders of
65

future pari passu debt

<<<

 and non-super senior hedging, if any, together holding more than 50% in aggregate principal value of the senior secured liabilities and (provided the aggregate amount of such debt is above a specified de minimis level) the pari passu liabilities

<<<

 then outstanding, and certain hedging liabilities permitted to be secured on a non-super senior basis pari passu with the Notes (the "Majority Senior Secured Creditors''). The Intercreditor Agreement sets forth that both the Majority Super

<<<

 Senior Creditors and the Majority Senior Secured Creditors shall be entitled to provide written enforcement instructions (the "Initial Enforcement Notice") to the Security Agent (which the Security Agent shall forward to each other creditor

<<<

 representative which did not deliver such notice). The Security Agent will act in accordance with the enforcement instructions received from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, subject to the following: (1) if (a) the Majority Senior Secured

<<<

 Creditors have not, within three months of the date of the Initial Enforcement Notice, either (i) made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue (and notified the Security Agent thereof

<<<

 in writing) or (ii) appointed a Financial Advisor (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) to assist them in making such a determination, or (b) the Super Senior Discharge Date (as defined under ``--Permitted Payments'' in "Description of

<<<

 Other Indebtedness--Intercreditor Agreement'' below) has not occurred within six months of the date of the Initial Enforcement Notice, the Security Agent will act in accordance with the enforcement instructions received from the Majority Super

<<<

 Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred; (2) if an insolvency event is continuing with respect to a debtor under the Intercreditor Agreement, then the Security Agent will, to the extent the Majority Super Senior

<<<

 Creditors elect to provide enforcement instructions, act in accordance with such instructions until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred; (3) if (a) the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the method

<<<

 of enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue (and notified the Security Agent thereof in writing) or appointed a Financial Advisor (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) to assist them in making such a determination

<<<

 and (b) the Majority Super Senior Creditors (i) determine in good faith (and notify the other creditor representatives and the Security Agent) that a delay in issuing enforcement instructions could reasonably be expected to have a material

<<<

 adverse effect on the ability to effect a distressed disposal or on the expected realisation proceeds of any enforcement and (ii) deliver enforcement instructions which they reasonably believe to be consistent with the Security Enforcement

<<<

 Principles (see "--Security Enforcement Principles'' in "Description of Other Indebtedness--Intercreditor Agreement" below) before the Security Agent has received any enforcement instructions from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, then

<<<

 the Security Agent will act in accordance with the enforcement instructions received from the Majority Super Senior Creditors until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred.
These arrangements could be disadvantageous to the holders of

<<<

 Notes in a number of respects and may permit the lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility to control enforcement in circumstances in which their interests are different from those of the holders of Notes. Disputes may occur between the

<<<

 holders of the Notes and creditors under our New Revolving Credit Facility, the counterparties to the relevant hedging arrangements or holders of any permitted additional indebtedness as to the appropriate manner of pursuing enforcement remedies

<<<

 and strategies with respect to the Collateral securing such obligations. In such an event, the holders of the Notes will be bound by any decisions of the instructing group, which may result in enforcement action in respect of the relevant Collateral

<<<

, whether or not such action is approved by the holders of the Notes or may be adverse to such noteholders. The Intercreditor Agreement also provides that the enforcement sale of any Collateral will be subject to, as a condition to the release

<<<

 of any claims of any other indebtedness secured by such collateral under the Intercreditor Agreement, certain protections intended to maximize the recovery from an enforcement sale. The creditors under the New Revolving Credit Facility, the

<<<

 counterparties to certain hedging arrangements or the holders of any permitted additional indebtedness may have interests that are different from the interest of holders of the Notes and they may elect to pursue their remedies under the relevant

<<<

 Security Documents at a time when it would otherwise be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so.
In addition, if the Security Agent sells Collateral comprising the shares of the Issuer or, if applicable, the shares of any of its

<<<

 subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Notes, the Note Guarantees (together with claims under the Notes) and the liens over any other assets securing the Notes and

<<<

 the Note Guarantee may be released. See "Description of other indebtedness--IntercreditorAgreement" and "Description of the Notes--Security--Release of Liens."
Other creditors not party to the Intercreditor Agreement could commence enforcement

<<<

 action against us or our subsidiaries during the consultation period, we or one or more of our subsidiaries could seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws, or the value of certain Collateral could otherwise be
66

impaired or reduced

<<<

 in value. In addition, if we incur substantial additional indebtedness which may be secured by security interests in the Collateral, the holders of the Notes may not comprise the requisite majority of the senior secured creditors for the purposes

<<<

 of instructing the Security Agent. See `Description o f Other Indebtedness--Intercreditor Agreement.''
It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Notes.
The Collateral will be subject to any and all exceptions,

<<<

 defects, encumbrances, liens, loss of legal perfection and other imperfections permitted under the Indenture and the New Revolving Credit Facility and accepted by other creditors that have the benefit of pari passu security interests in the

<<<

 Collateral securing the Notes from time to time pursuant to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, whether on or after the date the Notes are first issued. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens, loss of

<<<

 legal perfection and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the firstpriority ranking of security interests

<<<

 can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among other things, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or recharacterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions.
The security interests granted to the

<<<

 Security Agent in respect of the Collateral will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests over real or personal property such as the Collateral. For example, the Security Agent may need

<<<

 to obtain the consent of a third-party, including that of competent regulatory authorities (including competition regulators) or courts, to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any

<<<

 such consents. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets

<<<

, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease.
Furthermore, enforcement procedures and timing for obtaining judicial decisions in Finland, Sweden, Poland, Lithuania and any other jurisdictions in which Collateral may be located

<<<

 may be materially more complex and time-consuming than in equivalent situations in jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar.
In addition, our business requires a variety of national and local permits and licenses. The continued operation

<<<

 of properties that comprise part of the Collateral and that depend on the maintenance of such permits and licenses may be prohibited or restricted. Our business is subject to regulations and permitting requirements and may be adversely affected

<<<

 if we are unable to comply with existing regulations or requirements or if changes in applicable regulations or requirements occur. In the event of foreclosure, the grant of permits and licenses may be revoked, the transfer of such permits

<<<

 and licenses may be prohibited or may require us to incur significant cost and expense. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that the applicable governmental authorities will consent to the transfer of all such permits. If the regulatory approvals

<<<

 required for such transfers are not obtained, are delayed or are economically prevented, the foreclosure may be delayed, a temporary or lasting shutdown of operations may result, and the value of the Collateral may be significantly decreased

<<<

.
The Collateral is limited to certain categories of assets.
Certain limited assets will be pledged pursuant to the Security Documents. See `Description of the Notes-- Security.'' The Security Agent, and therefore indirectly the holders of the

<<<

 Notes, will only have an unsecured claim against any of the Issuer's or the Guarantors' assets that do not constitute Collateral.
The Collateral is subject to casualty risks.
We intend to continue to maintain insurance or otherwise insure against

<<<

 hazards in the manner described in this offering memorandum. There are, however, certain losses that may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable, in whole or in part. Insurance proceeds may not compensate us fully for our losses

<<<

. If there is a complete or partial loss of any of the Collateral, the insurance proceeds may not be sufficient to satisfy all of the secured obligations, including the Notes and the Note Guarantees. In addition, even if there is sufficient

<<<

 insurance coverage, if there is a total or partial loss of certain Collateral, there may be significant delays in obtaining replacement Collateral.
67

Enforcingyour rights as a holder ofthe Notes or under the Note Guarantees or security across

<<<

 multiplejurisdictions may prove difficult or provide less protection than U.S. bankruptcy law.
The Notes will be issued by the Issuer, a company incorporated under the laws of Finland. The Notes will be guaranteed by the Guarantors, which are

<<<

 incorporated under the laws of Finland, Sweden, Poland, Lithuania and Russia, and which hold assets in, among other jurisdictions, Finland, Sweden, Poland, Lithuania and Russia. In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings

<<<

 could be initiated in any, all or any combination of the above jurisdictions. Such jurisdictions may not be as favorable to investors as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which investors are familiar, and proceedings

<<<

 in these jurisdictions are likely to be complex and costly for creditors and otherwise may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of your rights. Your rights in and under the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Collateral

<<<

 will be subject to the bankruptcy, insolvency and administrative laws of the relevant jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that you will be able to effectively enforce your rights in such complex, multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or similar

<<<

 proceedings. See ``Certain Insolvency Law and Local Law Limitations'
In addition, in the event that one or more of the Issuer, the Guarantors and any future guarantor, if any, or any other of our subsidiaries experiences financial difficulty

<<<

, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of the Issuer's and the Guarantors' jurisdictions of organization and location of assets may be materially different from, or in conflict with, each other and those of the United States

<<<

, including in the areas of rights of creditors, contractual subordination, priority of governmental and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceedings. The application of these laws, or any conflict

<<<

 among them, could call into question whether the law of any particular jurisdiction should apply, and may adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Collateral in those jurisdictions or

<<<

 limit any amounts that you may receive. See "Service of Process and Enforcement o f Civil Liabilities'' with respect to certain of the jurisdictions mentioned above.
Moreover, in certain jurisdictions, the security interests in the Collateral

<<<

 will not give the Security Agent a right to prevent other creditors from foreclosing on and realizing the Collateral, but will only give the Security Agent priority (according to their rank) in the distribution of any proceeds of such realization

<<<

. Accordingly, the Security Agent and the holders of the Notes may not be able to avoid foreclosure by other creditors (including unsecured creditors) on the Collateral.
Each Note Guarantee will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement

<<<

 and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability.
Each Note Guarantee provides the holders of the Notes with a direct claim against the relevant Guarantor. However, the Indenture

<<<

 will provide that each Note Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that may be guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor without, among other things, rendering the relevant Note Guarantee, as it relates to that Guarantor, voidable or otherwise

<<<

 ineffective or limited under applicable law or resulting in the Guarantor's bankruptcy or causing the officers of the Guarantor to incur personal civil or criminal liability, and enforcement of each such Note Guarantee would be subject to certain

<<<

 generally available defenses. See ``Certain Insolvency Law and Local Law Limitations'
Enforcement of any of the Note Guarantees against any Guarantor, or of the security interests in respect thereof, will be subject to certain defenses available

<<<

 to Guarantors in the relevant jurisdiction. Although laws differ among these jurisdictions, these laws and defenses generally include those that relate to corporate purpose or benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference

<<<

, insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, financial assistance, preservation of share capital, thin capitalization, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally.
If one or more of these

<<<

 laws and defenses are applicable, a Guarantor may have no liability or decreased liability under its Note Guarantee depending on the amounts of its other obligations and applicable law. Limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained

<<<

 in New York courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of any Note Guarantee against any Guarantor.
Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law and other laws, a court could

<<<

 (i) avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor's obligations under its Note Guarantee or the security interests in respect thereof, (ii) direct that the holders of the Notes return any
68

amounts paid under a Note Guarantee to the

<<<

 relevant Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor's creditors or (iii) take other action that is detrimental to you, typically if the court found that:
 the relevant Note Guarantee was incurred with actual intent to give preference

<<<

 to one creditor over another, hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the relevant Guarantor or, in certain jurisdictions, when the granting of the Note Guarantee has the effect of giving a creditor a preference or when the recipient

<<<

 was aware that the relevant Guarantor was insolvent when it granted the relevant Note Guarantee;
 the relevant Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value or corporate benefit for the relevant Note Guarantee

<<<

 and such Guarantor was: (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant Note Guarantee; (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant Note Guarantee; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would

<<<

 incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity;
 the relevant Note Guarantee was held to exceed the corporate objects of the Guarantor or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor or was executed

<<<

 in the absence of corporate approvals required under the applicable law; or
 the amount paid or payable under the relevant Note Guarantee was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law.
These or similar laws may also apply

<<<

 to any future guarantee granted by any of our subsidiaries pursuant to the Indenture.
We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was ``insolvent'' at the relevant time or that, regardless of the

<<<

 method of the valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor was insolvent on the date its Note Guarantee was issued, that payments

<<<

 to holders of the Notes constituted preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds.
The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon applicable governing law. Generally, an entity would

<<<

 be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness:
 the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, is greater than the fair value of all its assets;
 the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount

<<<

 required to pay the probable liability on its existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they become due; or
 it cannot pay its debts as they become due.
The liability of each Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will

<<<

 be limited to the amount that will result in such Note Guarantee not constituting a preference, fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a

<<<

 court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor. There is a possibility that the entire Note Guarantee may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished.
If a court decided that a

<<<

 Note Guarantee was a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance and voided such Note Guarantee, or held it unenforceable for any other reason, you may cease to have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor and would be a creditor solely

<<<

 of the Issuer and, if applicable, of any other Guarantor under the relevant Note Guarantee that has not been declared void. In the event that any Note Guarantee is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent the agreed limitation

<<<

 of the Note Guarantee obligations apply, the Notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, and if we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes or any Note Guarantee is found to be a preference

<<<

, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. See ``Certain Insolvency Law and Local Law Limitations.''
The granting of the security

<<<

 interests in the Collateral may create hardening periods for such security interests in accordance with the law applicable in certain jurisdictions.
The granting of new security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes and the

<<<

 entry into the New Revolving Credit Facility may create hardening periods for such security interests in certain jurisdictions. The applicable hardening period will run as from the moment each new security interest has been granted, perfected

<<<

 or recreated.
69

In addition, the granting of a shared security interest to secure future debt may require the releasing and retaking of security or otherwise restart or reopen hardening periods in certain jurisdictions, as the Indenture

<<<

 will permit the release and retaking of security granted in favor of the Notes in certain circumstances, including in connection with the incurrence of future debt. The applicable hardening period for these new security interests will run from

<<<

 the moment each new security interest has been granted or perfected. If the security interest granted were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening period applicable in such jurisdiction, the security interest may be declared

<<<

 void or ineffective and it may not be possible to enforce it.
If the grantor of such security interest were to become subject to a bankruptcy or winding up proceeding after the Issue Date, any security interest in Collateral delivered after

<<<

 the Issue Date would face a greater risk than security interests in place on the Issue Date of being avoided by the grantor or by its trustee, receiver, liquidator, administrator or similar authority, or otherwise set aside by a court, as a

<<<

 preference under insolvency law. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, holders of the Notes would lose the benefit of the security interest. The same rights and risks also will apply with respect to future security

<<<

 interests granted in connection with the accession of further subsidiaries as additional Guarantors and the granting of security interests over their relevant assets and equity interests for the benefit of holders of the Notes. See `Description

<<<

 of the Notes--Security"
Rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the Collateral.
Applicable law may require that a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected

<<<

 and its priority retained through certain actions undertaken by the secured party or the grantor of the Collateral. The liens on the Collateral may not be perfected with respect to the Notes and the Note Guarantees, as the case may be, if the

<<<

 Security Agent is not able to or does not take the actions necessary to perfect or maintain the perfection of any such liens. Certain of these perfection steps may not be taken until after the Issue Date, or until the occurrence of certain

<<<

 events, as permitted by the Security Documents, the Indenture and the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. For example, in Poland, mortgages and pledges require registration, and such registration normally takes up to one month. However

<<<

, such registration may take three months or longer depending on court procedures, in particular if the court requests additional documents and information. In Finland, business mortgages and intellectual property pledges require registration

<<<

, and such registration normally takes up to three weeks. However, such registration may take up to one and a half months, depending on how quickly the relevant registrar acts to complete the registration process. Such failure may result in

<<<

 the invalidity of the relevant security interest in the Collateral securing the Notes, as applicable, or adversely affect the priority of such security interest in favor of third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors

<<<

 who claim a security interest in the same Collateral. In addition, applicable law may require that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest can only be perfected at the time such property and rights

<<<

 are acquired and identified. For example, establishment of a mortgage over newly acquired real property in Poland will require the issue by the security provider of a notarial mortgage deed and registration in the relevant land and mortgage

<<<

 register. There can be no assurance that the Security Agent will monitor, or that we will inform the Security Agent of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute Collateral, and that the necessary action will be taken to

<<<

 properly perfect the security interest in such after acquired collateral. The Security Agent has no obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute Collateral or the perfection of any security interest

<<<

 therein. Such failure may result in the loss of the security interest in the Collateral or adversely affect the priority of the security interest in favor of the relevant Notes and the Note Guarantees against third parties, including a trustee

<<<

 in bankruptcy and other creditors who may claim a secured interest in the Collateral. Additionally, the security interests over a number of the Collateral assets in Sweden and Finland have been granted over assets to be acquired (such as future

<<<

 receivables) or with delayed perfection and will only be perfected upon the occurrence of an enforcement event (See "Certain Insolvency Law and Local Law Limitations-- Sweden-- Creation of Valid Security Interests" and "--Finland-- Creation

<<<

 of Valid Security Interests").
Additionally, the Indenture and the Security Documents entered into in connection with the Notes will require us to take a number of actions that might improve the perfection or priority of the liens of the Security

<<<

 Agent in the Collateral. Certain of these perfection steps may not be taken until after the Issue Date, as permitted by the Security Documents. To the extent that the security interests created by the Security Documents with respect to any

<<<

 Collateral are not perfected, the Security Agent's rights will be equal to the rights of general unsecured creditors in the event of a liquidation, foreclosure, bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding.
70

There are circumstances

<<<

 other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be released automatically and under which the Note Guarantees will be released automatically, without your consent or

<<<

 the consent of the Trustee.
Under various circumstances, Collateral securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be released automatically (subject to compliance with certain requirements for the consent of the Security Agent, in the case

<<<

 of Collateral governed by Swedish law), including:
 only with respect to the security interests in the shares of the Issuer, in the event of an initial public offering of the Issuer as further described in `Description of the Notes--Security

<<<

--Release of Liens";
 subject to certain conditions, in connection with any sale or other disposition of such Collateral to a person that is not the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction subject to the "Merger" provisions

<<<

 of the Indenture), if such sale or other disposition does not violate the "Asset Sale" provisions of the Indenture or is otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture;
 in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Note Guarantee

<<<

 pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and capital stock, of such Guarantor;
 as permitted by the Indenture as provided under the caption `Description of the Notes--Amendments and Waivers";
 upon payment

<<<

 in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes, legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as provided under the captions "Description of the Notes--Defeasance" and "Description

<<<

 of the Notes-- Satisfaction and Discharge";
 if the Issuer designates any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets

<<<

, and capital stock, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary;
 in accordance with an enforcement action pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;
 to effect certain permitted reorganizations in accordance with

<<<

 the Indenture; or
 as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture.
Under various circumstances, Note Guarantees will be released automatically, including:
 upon a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger

<<<

) of the capital stock of the relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding company), or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary)

<<<

, if the sale or other disposition does not violate the Indenture and the Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer as a result of the sale or other disposition;
 if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary that is

<<<

 a Guarantor to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture;
 upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as provided under the captions "Description

<<<

 of the Notes--Defeasance" and "Description of the Notes--Satisfaction and Discharge";
 in the case of any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer that after the Issue Date is required to guarantee the Notes pursuant to the covenant described under

<<<

 "Description of the Notes-- Certain Covenants-- Additional Guarantees," so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, upon the release or discharge of the guarantee of Indebtedness by such Restricted Subsidiary which resulted

<<<

 in the obligation to guarantee the Notes;
 in accordance with an enforcement action in compliance with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;
 as described under "Description of the Notes--Amendments and Waivers

<<<

"; or
 as a result of a transaction permitted by ``--Certain Covenants--Merger and Consolidation--The Guarantors."
71

We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence

<<<

 of certain events constituting a change of control as required by the Indenture.
Upon the occurrence of a ``change of control," as defined in the Indenture, we would be required to offer to repurchase all the relevant outstanding Notes at a

<<<

 purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof on the date of purchase plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of purchase.
Our ability to fund the purchase price for any offer to

<<<

 purchase the Notes upon a change of control would be limited by our access to funds at the time and the terms of our other debt and contractual agreements, including the New Revolving Credit Facility and the Intercreditor Agreement. We may

<<<

 not have sufficient funds at the time of any such event to make the required repurchases. The source of funds for any repurchase required will be available cash or cash generated from operating activities or other sources, including borrowings

<<<

, sales of assets or sales of equity or funds provided by subsidiaries. We cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain the necessary level of financing. If an event constituting a change of control occurs at a time when our subsidiaries

<<<

 are prohibited from providing funds to ourselves for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes, our subsidiaries may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings

<<<

 that contain such prohibition. If a consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, we may be prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, a change of control may result in an event of default under, or acceleration of, our New Revolving

<<<

 Credit Facility, the Notes and any other indebtedness we may have outstanding. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under the New Revolving Credit Facility and other indebtedness, even if the change of

<<<

 control itself does not. Any failure by us to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture which would, in turn, constitute a default under the New Revolving Credit Facility and certain other indebtedness. See

<<<

 ``Description of the Notes-- Change of Control.''
The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring

<<<

, merger, recapitalization or other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a ``change

<<<

 of control" as defined in the Indenture. Except as described under `Description of the Notes-- Change of Control," the Indenture will not contain provisions that would require us to offer to repurchase or redeem the applicable Notes in the

<<<

 event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction.
The definition of ``change of control'' contained in the Indenture will include (with certain exceptions) a disposition of all or substantially all the

<<<

 assets of ourselves and our restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase ``all or substantially all,'' there is no precise established definition of the phrase

<<<

 under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of ``all or substantially all'' of our assets and its restricted subsidiaries

<<<

 taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and whether we are required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.
If an active trading market does not develop for the Notes, your ability to

<<<

 resell the Notes may be limited.
The Notes are new securities for which there is currently no market. We cannot assure you as to the liquidity of any market that may develop for the Notes, the ability of holders of the Notes to sell them or

<<<

 the price at which holders of the Notes may be able to sell them. Although application will be made for the Notes to be listed on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Global Exchange Market thereof within

<<<

 a reasonable period after the Issue Date, we cannot assure you that the Notes will become or remain listed. Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of the admission to trading on the Global Exchange Market

<<<

, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting of the Notes, as applicable, from the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange may have a material effect on a holder's ability to resell the Notes in the secondary market. Historically

<<<

, the market for non-investment grade debt has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. Any market for the Notes will likely be subject to similar disruptions and such

<<<

 disruptions may have a negative effect on you, as holder of the Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance.
72

The liquidity of any market for the Notes will depend on the number of holders of the Notes, prevailing interest

<<<

 rates, the market for similar securities and other factors, including general economic conditions and our own financial condition, performance and prospects, as well as third-party recommendations. The Initial Purchasers have informed us that

<<<

 they intend to make a market in the Notes. However, they are not obligated to do so and may discontinue such market-making at any time without notice. As a result, we cannot assure you that an active trading market for the Notes will develop

<<<

 or, if one does develop, that it will be maintained. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your Notes at fair value, if at all.
The liquidity of, and trading market for, the Notes may also be affected by declines

<<<

 in the market for high yield securities generally. Such a decline may affect any liquidity and trading of the Notes independent of our financial performance and prospects.
The Notes will initially be held in book-entryform, and therefore you

<<<

 must rely on the procedures of the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies.
The Notes will initially only be issued in global form and held through Euroclear and Clearstream.
Interests in the global notes will trade in

<<<

 book-entry form only, and the Notes in definitive registered form, or Definitive Registered Notes, will be issued in exchange for Book-Entry Interests only in very limited circumstances. Owners of Book-Entry Interests will not be considered

<<<

 owners of the Notes. The common depositary, or its nominee, for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the global notes representing the Notes. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect

<<<

 of the global notes representing the Notes will be made to The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch, as paying agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, these payments will be credited to participants' accounts

<<<

 that hold Book-Entry Interests in the global notes representing the Notes and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, we will have no responsibility or liability

<<<

 for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of Book-Entry Interests. Accordingly, if you own a Book-Entry Interest, you must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and if you are not a participant in

<<<

 Euroclear or Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the Notes under the Indenture.
Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of Book

<<<

-Entry Interests will not have the direct right to act upon our solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes. Instead, if you own a Book-Entry Interest, you will be permitted to act only to the

<<<

 extent you have received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear or Clearstream. The procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies may not be sufficient to enable you to vote on a timely basis.
Similarly, upon the occurrence of

<<<

 an event of default under the relevant Indenture, unless and until Definitive Registered Notes are issued in respect of all Book-Entry Interests, if you own a Book-Entry Interest, you will be restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream

<<<

. The procedures to be implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream may not be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Notes. See ``Book-Entry, Delivery and Form."
The transfer of the Notes is restricted, which may affect

<<<

 the value of the Notes.
The Notes are being offered and sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws of the United States. The Notes have not been and will not be registered under

<<<

 the Securities Act or any state securities laws. Therefore, you may not transfer or sell the Notes in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act

<<<

 and applicable state securities laws, or pursuant to an effective registration statement, and you may be required to bear the risk of your investment in the Notes for an indefinite period of time. The Notes and the Indenture contain provisions

<<<

 that restrict the Notes from being offered, sold or otherwise transferred except pursuant to the exemptions available pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act, or other exemptions under the Securities Act. In addition

<<<

, by acceptance of delivery of any Notes, the holder thereof agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor accounts for which it has purchased the Notes that it shall not transfer the Notes in an aggregate principal amount of less than

<<<

 100,000. Furthermore, we have not registered the Notes under any other country's securities laws and do not have any intention to do so. It is your obligation to ensure that your offers and sales of the Notes within the United States and other

<<<

 countries comply with applicable securities laws. See ``Transfer Restrictions."
73

The Notes may not become, or remain, listed on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange.
Although an application will be made for the Notes to be listed

<<<

 on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Global Exchange Market of the Irish Stock Exchange within a reasonable period after the Issue Date, the Issuer cannot assure you that the Notes will become, or

<<<

 will remain, listed. If the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Global Exchange Market of the Irish Stock Exchange and the Issuer can no longer maintain such listing, or if it becomes

<<<

 unduly burdensome to make or maintain such listing, the Issuer may cease to make or maintain such listing on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange;provided, however, that it will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and

<<<

 maintain the listing of the Notes on another "recognised stock exchange,'' although there can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to do so.
In addition, although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of

<<<

 listing the Notes on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange or another recognized stock exchange in accordance with the Indenture, failure to obtain approval for the listing or the delisting of the Notes from the Official List of the

<<<

 Irish Stock Exchange or another recognized stock exchange, as applicable, may have a material adverse effect on your ability to resell Notes in the secondary market.
The interests of our controlling shareholders may differ from the interests

<<<

 of the holders of the Notes.
The Issuer is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Safari Finco 1 Oy, a private limited liability company (``osakeyhtio") incorporated under the laws of Finland, which is in turn indirectly majority-owned by a lending syndicate

<<<

 comprised of over 30 financial institutions (the "Lender-Owner Syndicate"). The LenderOwner Syndicate took control of the Group in 2009 after a restructuring of the the Group's debt. In addition to the Existing Senior Notes and the Existing

<<<

 Senior Facility, the Lender-Owner Syndicate also holds the Existing Junior Notes issued by Safari Finco 1 Oy, as well as tracking preferred equity certificates issued by Safari Luxco 1 S.A. A portion of the proceeds of the Offering, together

<<<

 with cash on hand, will be used to (i) partially redeem, and pay accrued and unpaid interest on, the Existing Junior Notes and (ii) fund the purchase by Safari Luxco 2 S.A. of Existing Junior Notes from the Lender-Owner Syndicate.
As a result

<<<

, the Lender-Owner Syndicate is able to exercise significant influence over our corporate actions, including, but not limited to, the decision to incur indebtedness over a certain threshold, enter into significant transactions or undertake capital

<<<

Investors may face foreign currency exchange risks by investing in the Notes. The Notes will be denominated and payable in non-U.S. currency. Accordingly, for U.S. Holders

<<<

 (as defined under "Certain Tax Considerations--Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations"), an investment in a series of Notes will entail foreign currency exchange-related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes

<<<

 in the value of the non-U.S. currency relative to the U.S. dollar because of economic, political and other factors over which we have no control. Depreciation of the non-U.S. currency against the U.S. dollar may cause a decrease in the effective

<<<

 CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The discussion and analysis below provides information that we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our historical consolidated financial condition and results of operations. You should

<<<

 read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the sections entitled "Presentation of Financial and Other Information," "Summary-- Summary Financial, Operating and Other Information," "Selected Historical Consolidated Financial

<<<

 Information," "Use of Proceeds," "Capitalization" and "Business," as well as our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.
Thefollowing discussion and analysis

<<<

 of ourfinancial condition and results of operations as of and for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013 has been derived from, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, the audited consolidated financial statements o f Paroc

<<<

 Group Oy as o f and for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, which have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by the European Union ("IFRS").
The discussion and analysis of our

<<<

 financial condition and results of operations presented below includes certain non-IFRS measures that we use to evaluate our operating and financial performance. These non-IFRS measures are not recognized as measurements of our performance

<<<

 or liquidity under IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to operating profit or any other performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles or as alternatives to cash flows

<<<

 from operating, investing orfinancing activities. See "Presentation of Financial and Other Information--Non-IFRS Measures."
The following discussion and analysis includes forward-looking statements, which, although based upon assumptions that

<<<

 we consider to be reasonable, are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. See "Forward-Looking Statements

<<<

" and "Risk Factors."
Overview
We are a producer of premium stone wool insulation, and we believe that we are a market leader in Finland, Sweden and the Baltic States by market share, which according to our estimates has remained stable overall

<<<

 over the past three years. Our other important markets include Norway, Denmark, Poland, Germany and the United Kingdom. Our stone wool products are used for both building insulation and technical insulation, and are known for their high product

<<<

 quality and superior fire resistance, as evidenced by regular customer and market surveys. We have significantly broadened our geographic sales reach since 2009 through the expansion and leveraging of our strategically located manufacturing

<<<

 network, allowing for an increasing sales presence into western Europe and Russia, which we view to be potential growth markets. As of March 31, 2014, we operated nine production plants in five different countries with 13 Base production lines

<<<

, 18 Technical Insulation production lines and one Panel System production line. As of the same date, we had sales and representative offices in 14 European countries and sales to over 40 countries. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we generated

<<<

 total sales of 433.1 million (with Finland, Sweden and the Baltic States accounting for 20.2%, 25.1% and 8.6% of our total sales, respectively) and Adjusted EBITDA of 82.8 million.
Our business is organized in four divisions:
 Building Insulation

<<<

 ("BI"). Our Building Insulation division markets and distributes a range of insulation productions and solutions for residential and commercial buildings in both new-build and renovation construction markets. Products in the BI division range

<<<

 from general building insulation to more specialized acoustic or fire protection insulation products. General building insulation is the largest business segment within BI. The majority of the BI division's stone wool products are manufactured

<<<

 by our Base Production division, with the exception of some more specialized acoustics and roofing products, which are produced by our Technical Insulation division. The BI division does not have its own production lines or manufacturing capacity

<<<

. The BI division also sells panel wool internally to our Panel System division and sells insulation for pre-fabricated panels to third parties across Europe. For the year ended December 31, 2013, our Building Insulation division generated sales

<<<

 of 256.7 million (with external sales of 242.0 million, or 55.9% of our total sales).
 Technical Insulation ("TI"). Our Technical Insulation division produces high-quality stone wool products used in specialized industrial and technical applications

<<<

. Because the TI division's products are tailored for specific customer applications, including meeting regulatory requirements, the TI
80

division has its own manufacturing capacity. It uses stone wool from the Base Production division to

<<<

 produce more customized TI products through its own production lines and specialized machinery. There are 18 TI production lines at four plants. Products in the TI division are primarily used to provide insulation from heat, fire, condensation

<<<

 and sound, and are supplied to four key end-markets: heating, ventilation and air conditioning ("HV4C"), process industries, marine and offshore and original equipment manufacturers (``OEM"). The TI division also sells specialized acoustics

<<<

 and roofing products to the BI division. For the year ended December 31, 2013, our Technical Insulation division generated sales of 150.9 million (with external sales of 133.5 million, or 30.8% of our total sales).
 Panel System ("PPS"). Our

<<<

 Panel System division manufactures sandwich facade panels--lightweight steel-faced panels with an insulating core of stone wool. The main application of these panels are in the industrial and commercial construction of warehouses, municipal

<<<

 buildings and offices. The PPS division buys its stone wool from the BI division. For the year ended December 31, 2013, our Panel System division generated sales of 56.2 million (with external sales of 56.2 million, or 13.0% of our total sales

<<<

).
 Base Production ("Base"). Our Base Production division is responsible for producing all of the stone wool for our Building Insulation, Technical Insulation and Panel System divisions, developing proprietary production technology and managing

<<<

 capacity utilization across the Paroc Group. As of March 31, 2014, we operated eight production plants in five different countries with 13 Base Production lines producing stone wool. Production sites are managed as a network with production

<<<

 costs allocated to the most cost-efficient plant, taking into account distribution costs. For the year ended December 31, 2013, our Base division generated sales of 207.8 million (including internal sales of 207.3 million and external sales

<<<

 of 0.5 million). All of our internal sales are at a fixed cost agreed at the beginning of each year.
Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations
Set forth below is a description of certain key factors that have historically affected our

<<<

 results of operations and which may continue to impact our business in the future.
General market conditions and construction industry cyclicality
Similar to other building materials, demand for stone wool insulation in any geographic market

<<<

 is impacted by the level of construction activity within that geographic market. A substantial majority of our sales across the Group are driven by construction, meaning our results of operations depend to a large extent on the level of new

<<<

 build and renovation activity in both the residential, commercial and industrial construction sectors of the markets in which we operate. The construction industry is cyclical in nature and depends on the level of construction-related spending

<<<

 and investment in the residential, commercial and industrial sectors. The construction industry is particularly sensitive to factors such as economic growth, interest rates, cost and availability of financing for residential, commercial and

<<<

 industrial construction projects, inflation and other macroeconomic factors, although the new build construction market is subject to these cyclical effects to a much greater degree than the repair, maintenance and improvement ("RMT") construction

<<<

 market, which is less cyclical in nature. Our results of operations have been significantly affected by changes in the economic conditions of the markets in which we manufacture, market and sell our products. As a result of the global financial

<<<

 and economic crisis which began towards the end of 2007 and the subsequent sovereign debt and Eurozone crisis, we experienced a significant drop in revenue and EBITDA in 2009 for the entire Group as the availability of credit became very limited

<<<

 and the number of construction projects (especially in the new build residential sector) declined dramatically across Europe, particularly in Finland, Sweden and the Baltic States. Of our various operating divisions, Building Insulation ("BI

<<<

") is generally most sensitive to cyclicality in the construction industry and was affected most severely by the recent economic turmoil, given that it has greater exposure to the new build residential construction market and a higher proportion

<<<

 of sales in the Baltic States (which are typically more volatile than the Nordic countries) than our other divisions. In comparison, our Technical Insulation ("TI") division displayed a greater resilience during the recent economic downturn

<<<

 and over time has generally exhibited more stability in terms of gross profit margin than our BI division. This is primarily due to the fact that we sell our TI products to a more diversified set of end markets across Europe, which are driven

<<<

 by residential, commercial and industrial construction activities, as well as industrial production. As a result, we are exposed to the different business cycles presented by those markets. For example, although our TI division relies to some

<<<

 extent on the residential and commercial construction sectors (primarily for
81

the sale of heating, ventilation and air conditioning ("HVAC") products), we also supply our various TI products to the oil and gas, petrochemical, power generation

<<<

, pulp and paper, marine and offshore and original equipment manufacturer industries. Therefore, through the growth of our TI division since 2008, we believe we have benefited from a significantly greater degree of diversification in our business

<<<

 model and a greater level of stability with respect to our financial profile.
Regulatory initiatives and increased demand for energy efficiency
Our results of operations have been impacted by increased demand for energy efficiency in buildings

<<<

 as governments across Europe implement regulatory initiatives designed to reduce energy consumption. According to EU data, buildings account for approximately 40% of total energy consumption in the European Union, and heating accounts for the

<<<

 vast majority of this consumption. In recent years there has been an increased political focus throughout the European Union on climate change, which, in combination with rising energy costs, has resulted in the implementation of tighter regulations

<<<

 concerning energy efficiency both at the EU and the individual country level. Current EU directives, which impose energy efficiency requirements on new buildings, as well as renovated buildings, have set a target for a 20% reduction in energy

<<<

 consumption by 2020. Since this target is unlikely to be met under the measures currently in place, new energy efficiency goals for 2030 (which are likely to be in excess of the present 20% reduction target) are currently under review by the

<<<

 European Commission. At a national level, individual countries have put in place their own specific requirements from time to time over the last 10-15 years. Given that insulation can dramatically reduce heat loss and energy consumption in

<<<

 buildings and also has the added benefit of being the most cost-effective of all the available technologies to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, the implementation of more stringent energy efficiency requirements has affected demand for our

<<<

 products in our various geographic markets. However, the effect of tighter regulation in recent years has been most noticeable in the Baltic States, Poland and Russia. This is due to the fact that the Nordic countries have traditionally always

<<<

 had a more comprehensive set of energy efficiency measures in place, meaning there is less scope for broad-sweeping regulatory changes in those markets that are likely to significantly intensify demand for insulation in general, as compared

<<<

 to the Baltic States, Poland and Russia. In addition, the tightening of certain specific regulations (for example, the recent implementation in Finland and Sweden of new regulations requiring greater thicknesses for technical insulation) has

<<<

 fuelled demand for the higher margin, more specialized products offered by our TI division. Furthermore, an increased level of concern with respect to fire safety has also resulted in certain improvements being made to fire safety regulations

<<<

 in many of our markets (particularly in central Europe) in recent years, which has in turn also impacted our results of operations by increasing demand for our stone wool products, which are known for their superior fire resistance qualities

<<<

 as opposed to other insulation materials, particularly foam insulation.
Raw materials and energy cost
The main raw materials used in the manufacturing processes for our various stone wool products are stone, coke, binder, steel, coatings and

<<<

 adhesives, which accounted for 18%, 27%, 22%, 14%, 12% and 4%, respectively, of our raw materials cost for the year ended December 31, 2013. Our manufacturing processes also require large quantities of electricity, particularly at our two manufacturing

<<<

 facilities which operate electric furnaces. Collectively, raw materials, packaging materials and energy cost amounted to 136.4 million, 139.0 million and 133.9 million (or 44.1%, 43.6% and 43.0% of our total cost of sales) in the years ended

<<<

 December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively. The prices for our raw materials and energy requirements have fluctuated significantly in the past for a variety of reasons, many of which are beyond our control, and consequently our results

<<<

 of operations have been affected by such fluctuations.
During the year ended December 31, 2013, we sourced approximately 70% of our total stone requirements for the year from third parties. Although the underlying prices for stone have been

<<<

 relatively stable over the past five years, we have experienced volatility in connection with related inbound transport logistic costs, which are sensitive to the distance of delivery and oil price movements. We have also experienced significant

<<<

 volatility with respect to coke prices in recent years. Coke prices spiked in 2011 with an increase in price of approximately 28% over the previous year, but over the course of 2012 and 2013 prices have declined significantly. The falling price

<<<

 of coke over the last two years has been partially offset by an increase in the price of binder. Binder pricing fluctuates from year to year and is impacted mainly by movements in the market price for certain constituent chemicals (namely phenol

<<<

, urea and methanol), as well as any material changes in the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate. The average price for binder has increased in each of the last three years. Together, coke and binder represented approximately 50% of our
82

total

<<<

 raw materials cost (and approximately 13% of our total cost of sales) for the year ended December 31, 2013. Our total energy cost is driven by cost for the supply of electricity used in connection with our furnace processes. In the year ended

<<<

 December 31, 2013, our total energy cost (excluding coke) amounted to 27.5 million and accounted for 9% of our cost of sales.
In order to manage the risk of fluctuations in raw material and energy prices, we enter into supply agreements covering

<<<

 significant portions of our expected raw material and energy requirements for set periods of time, which may be on a monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual basis depending on the nature of the supply agreement. If raw material or energy

<<<

 prices decline after we have entered into the relevant supply agreement, we may have to pay prices under the agreement which are in excess of prevailing spot market prices, which may adversely impact our results of operations. We also seek

<<<

 to mitigate the risk of fluctuations in raw materials cost by implementing measures designed to improve efficiency of consumption, as well as using alternative, cheaper raw materials where possible. For example, with respect to stone, we generally

<<<

 try to source our supply locally and as close as possible to our manufacturing facilities and often seek to substitute virgin stone for cheaper industrial residual materials. With respect to coke, most of our requirements are now sourced on

<<<

 a quarterly basis from suppliers in Poland and Ukraine, on a semi-annual basis from suppliers in Spain and on an occasional basis from suppliers in Italy, which means we benefit from a better security of supply and improved logistics, working

<<<

 capital and price leverage as compared to our previous arrangements with suppliers in China. Coke prices are negotiated largely based on Australian coking coal price trends. For example, the significant spike that we experienced in 2011 with

<<<

 respect to coke prices was primarily the result of severe flooding in Queensland, which is a key region in the global supply of coking coal. With respect to binder, pricing under our current supply arrangements is agreed each month on a spot

<<<

 basis and is indexed to price movements in phenol, urea and methanol. In Finland and Sweden, which together account for approximately half of our annual electricity usage, we mitigate the risk of fluctuations in electricity prices by estimating

<<<

 our electricity consumption over a rolling three-year period and fixing prices each year for a specified percentage of our estimated usage for that year. We fix prices for between 75% and 85% of our estimated consumption in the first year,

<<<

 between 35% and 45% in the second year and between 10% and 20% in the third year. In Lithuania and Poland, which together generally account for the remainder of our electricity usage, we enter into long-term contracts with the relevant suppliers

<<<

 and fix prices for our electricity consumption on an annual basis.
Although historically we have generally been able to pass on increases in costs with respect to raw materials and energy to our customers by increasing prices for our products

<<<

, we generally have no contractual pass-through mechanisms in our contracts with dealers and other customers and there can be no assurance that we will be able to increase prices in the future. See "-- Competition and pricing'' below. See also

<<<

 ``Risk Factors--Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry--Our business may be negatively affected by volatility in raw and other material prices, our inability to retain or replace our key suppliers, unexpected supply shortages and disruptions

<<<

 of the supply chain'' and "--Increased energy cost or disruptions in energy supplies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. ''
Product mix
Our results of operations and gross profit

<<<

 margins are impacted as a result of changes in our product mix. Given the finite nature of our production capacity, our profitability generally improves to the extent that we are able to dedicate our production capacity to manufacture higher

<<<

 margin products and sell those products to our customers at prices which reflect the value-added nature of the products. In recent years, our growth strategy has involved a greater concentration on sales of higher margin, value-added HVAC products

<<<

 (in particular, pipe sections and certain types of wired mats) through our TI division, as opposed to less profitable industrial products. This strategic shift in product mix within our TI division was a major contributing factor to us achieving

<<<

 an overall increase in our consolidated gross profit margin from 23.6% in the year ended December 31, 2011 to 28.1% in the year ended December 31, 2013, despite recording only a slight increase in volumes of TI products sold.
Seasonality and

<<<

 weather conditions
The construction industry, and therefore demand for stone wool insulation and other building materials generally, is seasonal in nature and dependent on weather conditions, as periods of frost, snow or heavy rain can negatively

<<<

 affect construction activities. Accordingly, these seasonal effects frequently impact our results of operations. In general, due to the climate, many construction sites in our core markets open in
83

the spring with the majority of outdoor

<<<

 construction work occurring during the summer months. By the time autumn arrives, construction work generally moves inside to focus on general interior insulation, sound and acoustic insulation, heating systems, air conditioning and fire proofing

<<<

. As a result, sales across the entire Group are generally weighted more towards the second half of each year, with sales increasing throughout the autumn months and tending to peak in September and October. Construction activities then decline

<<<

 dramatically during the winter, when weather conditions in our core markets are at their most severe, which means we experience a corresponding decline in sales over that time. The lower level of demand for our products which we experience

<<<

 during periods of cold weather may be further aggravated by particularly harsh weather conditions, such as those experienced in the winter of 2012/2013. Inclement weather conditions can also adversely affect our results of operations if they

<<<

 occur with unusual intensity, during abnormal periods, or last longer than usual in our core markets, especially during peak construction periods. Furthermore, public holidays and vacation periods constitute an additional factor that may exacerbate

<<<

 certain seasonality effects, as construction projects or industrial production processes may temporarily cease. In general, we experience a significant drop in sales in July each year due to the traditional Northern European holiday season

<<<

. As a result of these seasonal effects, the results of any given single fiscal quarter might not be a reliable basis for the expectations of a full fiscal year and may not be comparable with the results in the other fiscal quarters in the same

<<<

 year or previous years.
Competition and pricing
A primary factor affecting our profitability, in addition to the structure of our cost base, the absolute level of cost and our ability to manage our operating costs, is the price that we are

<<<

 able to charge to our customers for our products. Due to the strength of our brand, which is underpinned by the superior quality of our portfolio of premium, high-specification stone wool products and our ability to provide innovative, customer

<<<

-specific solutions through our full-service sales and technical support offering, we believe that we have been able to achieve premium prices for our products in the past. Our ability to increase prices from time to time may be limited by the

<<<

 level of competition to which we are subject in the relevant market. We generally experience more intense price pressure in those markets where we have a relatively small market share or in which we have a greater number of competitors, as

<<<

 compared to those markets where we have a significant market share or in which we have a limited number of competitors. Our competitors' pricing policies may be influenced by, among other things, general economic conditions and more specifically

<<<

 conditions within the construction industry, the number of competitors and their production capacities, our competitors' cost base and general business strategy. A period of reduced demand for stone wool insulation (either as a result of a

<<<

 downturn in the construction industry, adverse weather conditions or otherwise) may result in at least temporary excess capacity and increased competition from our competitors as they lower prices and seek to gain market share. There can be

<<<

 no assurance that any price increases on our part will be accepted by our customers in the future, or that we will be able to pass on further increases in the cost of raw materials, energy and other input factors in a sustainable manner, or

<<<

 at all, or that we will be able to maintain premium prices for our products. To the extent that we do implement price increases, our sales volumes and market share may be adversely affected, at least temporarily, if our competitors do not also

<<<

 increase their prices, or only do so after a delay. See also ``Business--Competition. ''
Cost structure and cost saving initiatives
For the year ended December 31, 2013, approximately 83% of our cost of sales was variable, comprising, among

<<<

 other things, raw materials cost, energy cost, direct production wages and distribution cost, which generally move in line with changes in volume. Accordingly, the cost base within our business is relatively flexible, meaning that our results

<<<

 of operations are impacted from year to year as a result of variations within our cost structure. For example, our manufacturing processes allow for flexible shift systems and capacity adjustments to meet increased or decreased levels of demand

<<<

 for our products. As a result, during periods of peak demand for our products, we are generally able to increase the number of factory shifts per day in order to meet the additional demand. Furthermore, we have implemented initiatives from

<<<

 time to time to make improvements with respect to productivity, efficiency and selling, general and administrative expenses, which have impacted our results of operations and helped to improve our historical profitability. Overall, through

<<<

 the implementation of such initiatives, we achieved direct cost savings of 2.5 million, 0.5 million and 4.4 million in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively. On top of these productivity savings, we have executed a

<<<

 maintenance saving program that has successfully reduced costs by 2.8 million over the course of the last three financial years through the centralization of certain maintenance and repair processes. We have also realized savings from projects

<<<

 designed to increase the
84

efficiency of our organizational structure. For example, by establishing a centralized financial service center in Vilnius, Lithuania and implementing other internal transformational measures with respect to certain

<<<

 business functions, we estimate that we have reduced our direct office and finance costs in the amount of 1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Going forward, we intend to continue to make investments to maintain and improve our

<<<

 production facilities and processes to ensure high productivity and reduce operational costs. See ``--Liquidity and Capital Resources-- Capital expenditures."
Geographic expansion and capital expenditures
We have a history of mainly organic

<<<

 expansion. Since 2009, we have significantly broadened our geographic sales reach by expanding and leveraging our strategically-located manufacturing footprint, which has allowed us to benefit from an increased sales presence and larger customer

<<<

 base within Western Europe and Russia, which has, in turn, impacted our results of operations. For example, as our TI business has grown, the geographic markets in which we are able to sell our higher margin, value-added TI products have also

<<<

 broadened and increased in scale, since it is generally more economically feasible to transport TI products over long distances as compared to BI products. In particular, the location of our Polish manufacturing facility has significantly increased

<<<

 the scope for sales of TI products into markets in Western Europe, including Germany and the United Kingdom, which we view as key growth markets for our TI division.
As of March 31, 2014, we had eight manufacturing facilities (excluding our

<<<

 factory located in Lappeenranta, which is scheduled to close down in 2016) located in Finland, Sweden, Poland, Lithuania and Russia, and we sold our products in more than 40 countries. Historically, we have invested in new plants in Poland

<<<

 and Lithuania to benefit from high growth markets in the Baltic States and Eastern Europe. Most recently, as part of our ongoing strategy to establish a manufacturing presence in high growth markets, we expanded our Russian operations and invested

<<<

 approximately 60 million in the construction of a new manufacturing facility in Tver, which is strategically located between Moscow and Saint Petersburg, allowing for ease of transport of products to end customers within Russia. The first production

<<<

 line for the manufacture of base stone wool at the new facility (``Tver Line 1") began meaningful commercial production in January 2014, although we do not yet have local TI production capacity in Russia. We have been importing our products

<<<

 into Russia since 1993. However, we are now enjoying significant benefits from having a local manufacturing presence in Russia. Local in-country production has enabled us to become more competitive in the Russian market, since we now benefit

<<<

 from significantly lower transportation costs, as well as the removal of substantial import tariffs, which previously limited the profitability of our Russian sales. We intend production at our Tver manufacturing facility to replace a substantial

<<<

 majority of the products which we have historically imported from plants in neighboring countries to supply the Russian market. Furthermore, we are currently considering making further material capital expenditures to expand production capacity

<<<

 at our Tver manufacturing facility. See ``--Key Factors Affecting Our Future Results of Operations--Further Russian expansion," "--Liquidity and Capital Resources-- Capital expenditures" and "Business--Divisions--Russian expansion." Operations

<<<

 in new markets or investments in new manufacturing facilities frequently have periods of start-up losses, and it may take a substantial period of time, subject to developments in the relevant markets, for such new operations or investments

<<<

 to become profitable.
Our capital expenditures can principally be divided into two categories: (i) maintenance capital expenditures, which are capital expenditures required to sustain the ongoing performance of our operations or otherwise adjust

<<<

 our operations to adhere to legislative or regulatory requirements, and (ii) strategic growth investments, which are capital expenditures designed to enhance productivity, achieve cost savings or gain a particular commercial advantage. Maintenance

<<<

 capital expenditures in 2012 and 2013 were generally stable at 10.3 million and 10.6 million, respectively. However, during 2011, maintenance capital expenditures were significantly higher at 15.8 million due to the implementation of several

<<<

 large one-off projects which impacted our results of operations. For example, we replaced packaging machinery at our manufacturing facility in Oulu, installed a sulphur cleaning system at our manufacturing facility in Hallekis and added module

<<<

 machines and robot palletizers to the packing ends at our manufacturing facility in Parainen. In comparison, strategic growth investments (excluding those made in connection with our Russian expansion) amounted to 6.0 million, 9.9 million and

<<<

 7.0 million for 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively. Historically, the split between maintenance capital expenditures and strategic growth investments has been relatively equal, although in recent years maintenance capital expenditures have taken

<<<

 precedence to our strategic growth investments outside Russia as a result of the extra capital we have been required to commit in connection with our Russian expansion. Although maintenance capital
85

expenditures have remained relatively

<<<

 steady over the last two years, we may be required to make additional maintenance capital expenditures in the future as we start to operate at higher utilization rates. In addition, increased levels of capital expenditure for expansion, maintenance

<<<

 and optimization may be followed by an increase in depreciation expense as machinery and buildings will be depreciated over their useful lives.
Exchange rate fluctuations
Although our reporting currency for purposes of our consolidated financial

<<<

 statements is the euro, a significant portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the euro, including the Swedish krona, the Norwegian krone, the Danish krone, the Lithuanian litas, the Polish zloty, the Russian rouble and

<<<

 the British pound. Accordingly, our results of operations are subject to currency effects, primarily currency translation exposure. For purposes of our consolidated financial statements, the profits and losses of our subsidiaries with a functional

<<<

 currency other than the euro are translated into euro at average exchange rates, while assets and liabilities are translated into euro at the closing exchange rate as of the date of the applicable statement of financial position. Excluding

<<<

 sales denominated in the Latvian lats (which was replaced by the euro as of January 1, 2014) and the Lithuanian litas (which is pegged to the euro), we generated approximately 56% of our revenue in currencies other than the euro during the

<<<

 year ended December 31, 2013; namely the Swedish krona (accounting for approximately 30% of our total revenue), the Russian rouble (accounting for approximately 8% of our total revenue), the Norwegian krone (accounting for approximately 7%

<<<

 of our total revenue), the Polish zloty (accounting for approximately 6% of our total revenue), the Danish krone (accounting for approximately 3% of our total revenue) and the British pound (accounting for approximately 2% of our total revenue

<<<

). Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (particularly in relation to the Swedish krona, the Russian rouble, the Norwegian krone, the Polish zloty, the Danish krone and the British pound) can affect the value of our foreign assets

<<<

, liabilities, sales and costs when reported in euro and will therefore give rise to period-on-period differences in our results of operations.
Transaction-related exposure at our subsidiaries is relatively limited because their revenues and

<<<

 expenses are, in general, generated and incurred in their respective operating or functional currencies. However, we do face some transaction risk, primarily as a result of sales being made out of Finland into Sweden and Norway, out of Sweden

<<<

 into Norway and Denmark and out of Poland into Germany and the United Kingdom. As a result of our recent Russian expansion, we also face transaction risk to the extent we source coke and other raw materials from countries with a functional

<<<

 currency other than the Russian rouble. We mitigate the risk of fluctuations in exchange rates through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts. Specifically, we forecast our cash flows by currency on a rolling six-month basis and hedge

<<<

 between 60% and 80% of those estimated cash flows, calculated on a Group basis. Currency translation exposure is not hedged. While our hedging strategy enables us to partly mitigate the effects on our cash flows of an appreciation of the value

<<<

 of the euro compared to the respective functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries over the relevant period, it does not enable us to mitigate the risk of a long-term appreciation of the euro compared to the respective functional currencies

<<<

 of our foreign subsidiaries. Furthermore, we are also subject to foreign currency effects linked to loans (including intercompany loans) made in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity advancing or receiving those loans

<<<

. For example, we currently have an outstanding SEK-denominated intercompany loan from Paroc Group Oy (the functional currency of which is the euro) to Paroc Sverige AB (the functional currency of which is the Swedish krona) which, as of December

<<<

 31, 2013, had a book value of 225.8 million. Due to favorable exchange rate movements that have occurred during the period since the intercompany loan was made, Paroc Group Oy is likely to realize a substantial taxable gain upon repayment of

<<<

 the intercompany loan, which repayment may occur in connection with the Transactions. See also "Risk Factors--Risks Relating to Our Business and Our Industry-- Currency rate and interest rate fluctuations might adversely affect our financial

<<<

 position and results of operations," and "--Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk--Exchange rate risk."
Interest rate fluctuations
We have a significant amount of long-term indebtedness, including under our Existing Senior

<<<

 Notes and our Existing Senior Facility, pursuant to which we pay interest at a floating interest rate. Accordingly, our various debt instruments expose us to fluctuations in interest rates which can impact our results of operations. Specifically

<<<

, if interest rates increase, our interest expense will also increase, and conversely, if interest rates decrease, our interest expense will also decrease. Through our Group treasury, we monitor
86

market conditions and may from time to time

<<<

 implement appropriate measures to manage interest rate risk, including the utilization of approved interest rate derivatives. As of December 31, 2013, our 350 million Existing Senior Notes were fully hedged through interest rate swaps until

<<<

 February 2015, pursuant to which we pay fixed interest and receive a floating interest rate linked to three-month EURIBOR. See also "-- Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk--Interest rate risk. ''
Key Factors Affecting

<<<

 Our Future Results of Operations
In addition to the matters discussed above under "--Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations," we expect that our future results of operations will be also affected by the key factors described below

<<<

.
Further Russian expansion
We believe Russia (which accounted for 8.3% of the Group's revenue for the financial year ended December 31, 2013) represents an attractive growth market for our business. Accordingly, we are currently considering

<<<

 a plan to significantly expand our production capacity at our new manufacturing facility in Tver by adding a second production line for the manufacture of base stone wool (``Tver Line 2"), as well as additional machinery that would provide

<<<

 us with off-line TI production capacity in Russia. This potential second phase of our Russian expansion remains subject to internal approval, which we would not expect to receive prior to the second half of 2014. In the event that we proceed

<<<

 with the second phase of our Russian expansion, we expect that we will make total capital expenditures in the amount of approximately 75 million during the 18 to 24 month period following any decision to proceed with the project. We expect

<<<

 that we would fund these capital expenditures using cash generated by our operating activities.
As a result of the construction and commissioning of Tver Line 1, our operating model with respect to Russia has fundamentally changed from an import

<<<

 model to a local production model, and this transformation would be further reinforced if we were to proceed with the second phase of our Russian expansion. As a result of this change in our operating model, we expect that we will be able to

<<<

 serve the Russian market at a significantly lower cost than we have achieved historically, since local production enables us to make savings with respect to distribution costs (partly due to the shorter distances between our Tver manufacturing

<<<

 facility and our customers, and partly due to our finished products no longer being subject to substantial Russian import duty). Over time, we expect this cost saving will result in EBITDA growth. However, our establishment of a manufacturing

<<<

 presence in Russia also entails risks, which would increase if we proceed with the second phase of our Russian expansion. See "Risk Factors--Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry-- We operate in emerging markets such as Russia, which

<<<

 exposes us to risks inherent to such less developed markets, and we may be exposed to greater risks as we intend to increase our operations in such markets" and "-- We may not be able to successfully manage future growth, including by way of

<<<

 organic growth to new regions and potential acquisitions which may expose us to additional risks." Furthermore, the effect of our expansion into Russia in the short term (as our operations ramp up) will be to increase the level of our cost

<<<

 of sales, operating expenses and depreciation, as well as decrease our margins. There can be no assurance that the benefits we expect to derive from our expansion into Russia will be realized.
Lappeenranta closure
The owner of the land on which

<<<

 our Lappeenranta manufacturing facility is situated has informed us that it does not intend to renew our lease of that land upon its expiration in 2019. Accordingly, we have decided to end our production operations on the site by the end of

<<<

 2016, which will impact our future results of operations. As a result of the closure, we will be required to reallocate resources and transfer production operations and equipment from the Lappeenranta site to certain of our other manufacturing

<<<

 facilities, which is already in process. See "Business--Divisions--Production facilities and intersegment sales-- Lappeenranta closure." We will incur significant costs and expenses in connection with the closure of the Lappeenranta site and

<<<

 the transfer of operations to our other manufacturing facilities. Specifically, we expect that we will incur capital expenditures of approximately 7 million in connection with the transfer process, as well as demolition, land clearing and remediation

<<<

 costs of approximately 9 million. Furthermore, we expect that we will incur productivity losses, labor efficiency losses and other incremental costs during the transfer period. There is a risk that the transfer process may not proceed according

<<<

 to plan and that actual expenses may materially exceed our estimates. The transfer process may also result in significant disruptions to our production operations and impair our ability to service our customers. See ``Risk Factors--Risks Related

<<<

 to Our Business and Our Industry--Interruptions in operations at our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows"
87

and ``-- The closure of the Lappeenranta facility

<<<

 may result in greater costs or disruptions to our business than currently expected. "
Presentation of Financial Information
The following is a discussion of our key consolidated statement of income items. For additional information, see "Note

<<<

 2--Summary of significant accounting policies" of our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.
Revenue
Revenue primarily consists of income generated from the sale of building materials, including

<<<

 building insulation, technical insulation, marine insulation, panels and acoustic products, as well as the sale of services to third parties. Revenue from the sale of building materials is recognized when all the following criteria have been

<<<

EBITDA
We define EBITDA as profit/(loss) for the period from continuing operations before income tax expense, finance

<<<

 income and costs, depreciation, amortization and impairment and share of results of associates.
We present EBITDA in this offering memorandum only as a supplemental measure of our performance and liquidity. EBITDA is not recognized as a measurement

<<<

 of our performance or liquidity under IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative to operating profit or any other performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS. See "Presentation of Financial and Other Information--Non-IFRS

<<<

 Measures' and "Summary--Summary Financial and Operating Information-- Summary Other Financial Information. "
Segment Reporting
Historically, we have not been required under IFRS to present segment information in our audited consolidated financial

<<<

 statements. However, in connection with the Offering, we have adopted segment reporting going forward and therefore we have presented certain segment information herein for each of the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013.
For these

<<<

 purposes, our three segments under IFRS are:
 Insulation, which corresponds to our BI division and TI division;
 Panel System, which corresponds to our PPS division; and  Base Production, which corresponds to our Base Production division

<<<

.
89

We also present in this offering memorandum certain eliminations and allocations, which provide for eliminations in respect of intercompany trading and other transactions between our operating divisions, as well as allocation of central

<<<

 overhead and management charges among our operating divisions, for purposes of Group consolidation. Our Base Production division is responsible for the manufacture of stone wool, which it supplies primarily to our BI and TI divisions pursuant

<<<

 to fixed price agreements entered into at the beginning of each year. Our Base Production division also makes very small external sales of raw stone wool directly to third parties. Our BI division principally markets and sells the stone wool

<<<

 products purchased from our Base Production division to external third parties, but it also makes internal sales of panel stone wool to our PPS division. Our TI division uses the raw stone wool purchased from our Base Production division to

<<<

 manufacture highly customized, value-added technical insulation products through specialized off-line production processes. Our TI division principally markets and sells its finished TI products to external third parties, but it also makes

<<<

 internal sales of specialized acoustic and roofing products to our BI division. For further details with respect to the trading relationships between our operating divisions, see ``Business--Divisions--Production facilities and intersegment

<<<

 sales." In the following tables, we present revenue data with respect to our Base Production reporting segment for each of the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013. However, given that our Base Production division principally makes

<<<

 only internal sales to our other operating divisions and generates no material external income, we have not presented a discussion of the results of operations for our Base Production reporting segment for the periods under review, since such

<<<

 a discussion would not be meaningful. Rather, reference should be made to the discussion of results of operations presented hereafter for our Insulation reporting segment.

Revenue
Our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2013 remained generally flat at

<<<

 433.1 million, compared to 430.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012.
Insulation
Total revenue for our Insulation reporting segment in the year ended December 31, 2013 increased by 1.5% from 385.1 million in the year ended December

<<<

 31, 2012 to 390.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2013.
Building Insulation revenue remained generally flat in the year ended December 31, 2013 at 256.7 million, compared to 257.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, with volumes

<<<

 generally flat, primarily as a result of a decline in the level of residential construction activity and a continuation of challenging market and economic conditions in several key markets, particularly in Finland and Sweden (where we faced

<<<

 strong competition, principally with respect to roofing products, as a result of aggressive pricing by a new market entrant seeking to gain market share).
Technical Insulation revenue increased by 4.6% from 144.3 million in the year ended December

<<<

 31, 2012 to 150.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, despite volumes remaining generally flat, primarily as a result of our continued focus on sales of higher margin, value-added HVAC products resulting in an improved product mix

<<<

 variance, combined with an increase in prices for our TI products generally and the implementation of regulatory changes in Finland and Sweden requiring new buildings to have thicker, better quality technical insulation.
Panel System
Revenue

<<<

 for our Panel System reporting segment decreased by 5.1% from 59.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 to 56.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily as a result of a decline in demand for PPS products due to slow market

<<<

 conditions in Finland and across Scandinavia (particularly in Norway, where there was a natural drop in the level of activity compared to the previous year, during which there were a particularly high number of construction projects requiring

<<<

 our PPS products), resulting in a reduction in our order intake, combined with a decrease in local currency prices and foreign exchange translation losses.
Cost of sales
Our cost of sales decreased by 2.2% from 318.6 million in the year ended

<<<

 December 31, 2012 to 311.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily as a result of a significant decline in the cost of raw materials (particularly coke) during the year, combined with an increase in the level of productivity

<<<

 in our manufacturing processes, partially offset by an increase in distribution costs due to increased sales into Russia, which involve the transportation of products over long distances to Russian customers and the incurrence of significant

<<<

 import tariffs.
Selling and marketing expenses
Our selling and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2013 remained flat at 34.9 million, compared to 34.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2012.
Research and development expenses

<<<


Our research and development expenses decreased by 9.4% from 6.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 to 6.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily as a result of a decline in R&D depreciation in the amount of 0.9 million

<<<

, partially offset by a general increase in the level of spending with respect to R&D activities during the year.
Administrative expenses
Our administrative expenses increased by 7.4% from 25.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 to

<<<

 26.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily as a result of the expansion of our Russian operations and an increase in administrative expenses in connection therewith in the amount of 1.6 million following a gradual organizational

<<<

 ramp-up over the course of the year ended December 31, 2012.
92

Other operating income Our other operating income increased by 58.9% from 0.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 to 0.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2013,

<<<

 primarily as a result of our realization of an unusual item of income in the amount of 0.4 million as a result of our successful appeal with respect to a previously paid tax penalty in Finland in respect of the year ended December 31, 2011

<<<

.
Other operating expenses Our other operating expenses increased by 39.3% from 5.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 to 7.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily as a result of expenses incurred in connection with

<<<

 our Russian expansion, including associated start-up expenses and expenses incurred in connection with demolition activities undertaken at the brownfield site on which our new manufacturing facility in Tver is located prior to the beginning

<<<

 of meaningful commercial production at Tver Line 1 in January 2014.
Dividend received, interest income and other financial income Our dividend received, interest income and other financial income decreased by 73.7% from 8.9 million in the year

<<<

 ended December 31, 2012 to 2.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily as a result of movements in foreign exchange rates impacting the revaluation of internal loans and the market value of foreign exchange derivatives.
Interest

<<<

 expenses Our interest expenses decreased by 24.5% from 12.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 to 9.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily as a result of a decrease in the rate of threemonth EURIBOR over the period

<<<

.
Other financial expenses Our other financial expenses decreased by 11.7% from 11.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 to 10.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily as a result of movements in foreign exchange rates

<<<

 impacting the revaluation of internal loans and the market value of foreign exchange derivatives.
Income tax expense Our income tax expense decreased by 41.4% from 7.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 to 4.1 million in the year ended

<<<

 December 31, 2013, primarily as a result of the creation of a deferred tax liability in the amount of 2.2 million being created during the year ended December 31, 2012 with respect to undistributed earnings of our Estonian subsidiary. In addition

<<<

, the change in the Finnish income tax rate from 24.5% to 20.0% contributed to a positive impact of 3.8 million on the income tax expense for 2013.
EBITDA Our total EBITDA increased by 11.0% from 69.0 million in the year ended December 31, 

<<<

2012 to 76.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, which can be attributed principally to an increase in sales of higher margin, value-added HVAC products resulting in an improved product mix variance, combined with a significant decline

<<<

 in the cost of raw materials (particularly coke) and efficiency and productivity gains realized with respect to our manufacturing processes, partially offset by the incurrence of one-off costs in connection with the expansion of our Russian

<<<

 operations and the construction and commencement of operations of Tver Line 1.

Revenue
Our total revenue increased by 6.3% from 404.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 to 430.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2012.
Insulation
Total revenue for our

<<<

 Insulation reporting segment increased by 5.0% from 366.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 to 385.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2012.
Building Insulation revenue increased by 3.7% from 248.7 million in the year ended December

<<<

 31, 2011 to 257.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, despite a decline in volumes due to challenging market and economic conditions in several key markets, primarily as a result of budgeted price increases implemented during the year

<<<

 and foreign exchange translation gains.
Technical Insulation revenue increased by 10.4% from 130.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 to 144.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily as a result of improvements being

<<<

 made with respect to product mix as part of our continued focus on sales of higher margin, value-added HVAC products, price increases being implemented during the year and volume growth fuelled by expansion into new markets in Germany, the

<<<

 United Kingdom and Switzerland during the year.
Panel System
Revenue for our Panel System reporting segment increased by 15.8% from 51.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 to 59.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily

<<<

 as a result of an increase in volumes driven by a rise in the level of market activity, particularly in Sweden and Norway, where increased sales also benefited from foreign exchange translation gains, together with an increase in prices.
Cost

<<<

 of sales
Our cost of sales increased by 3.1% from 309.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 to 318.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, largely as a result of higher volumes. However, the rate of increase in cost of sales

<<<

 was proportionally less than the rate of total revenue growth for the same year, primarily as a result of a growth in sales of higher margin products, a slight improvement in productivity and a slight decrease in raw materials cost, which,

<<<

 taken together, more than offset an increase in distribution costs due to increased sales into Russia, which involve the transportation of products over long distances to Russian customers and the incurrence of significant import tariffs, and

<<<

 higher indirect production costs due to one-off spare parts write-down in the amount of 1.5 million following a change in accounting policy.
Selling and marketing expenses
Our selling and marketing expenses increased by 4.3% from 33.4 million

<<<

 in the year ended December 31, 2011 to 34.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily as a result of an increase in the level of internal sales and marketing resources dedicated to supporting our Russian expansion.
Research and

<<<

 development expenses
Our research and development expenses increased by 15.9% from 6.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 to 6.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily as a result of the one-time impairment write-down

<<<

 of certain technology development costs in April 2012, combined with a slight reduction in the level of spending with respect to R&D activities during the year which partially offset a depreciation charge in the year.
Administrative expenses

<<<


Our administrative expenses increased by 20.2% from 20.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 to 25.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily as a result of costs incurred in connection with the restructuring of our finance

<<<

, accounting and controlling functions, an impairment write-down in respect of certain Russian real property assets and certain other increased administrative expenses (including, among other things, with respect to recruitment in connection

<<<

 with our Russian expansion and the transfer of our corporate headquarters to new premises in Helsinki).
95

Other operating income Our other operating income increased by 87.6% from 0.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 to 0.3 million

<<<

 in the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily as a result of income generated from the sale of shares held in a company outside the Group.
Other operating expenses Our other operating expenses decreased by 27.4% from 6.9 million in the year

<<<

 ended December 31, 2011 to 5.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily as a result of a decline in certain unusual expense items as compared to the prior year (specifically, with respect to one-time costs related to our Russian

<<<

 expansion and redundancy costs for the year), partially offset by a higher cost of bad debt allowances for certain customers in Finland and Norway.
Dividend received, interest income and other financial income Our dividend received, interest

<<<

 income and other financial income increased by 27.1% from 7.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 to 8.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily as a result of movements in foreign exchange rates impacting the revaluation

<<<

 of internal loans and the market value of foreign exchange derivatives.
Interest expenses Our interest expenses decreased by 15.2% from 14.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 to 12.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily

<<<

 as a result of a decrease in the rate of threemonth EURIBOR over the period.
Other financial expenses Our other financial expenses decreased by 29.9% from 17.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 to 11.9 million in the year ended December

<<<

 31, 2012, primarily as a result of movements in foreign exchange rates impacting the revaluation of internal loans and the market value of foreign exchange derivatives.
Income tax expense Our income tax expense changed from a tax credit of

<<<

 0.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 to a tax expense of 7.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily as a result of a substantial increase in our profit before tax from 4.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2

<<<

011 to 24.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, as well as the devaluation of certain deferred tax assets during the year ended December 31, 2012 in connection with the forfeiture of certain tax losses in Paroc Oy AB during the prior

<<<

 year, partially offset by the write-down of certain intragroup loans being deductible from taxation and our utilization of previously unrecognized tax losses during the year in the amount of 1.3 million. In addition, the change in the Swedish

<<<

 tax rate from 26.3% to 22.0% contributed to a positive impact of 2.2 million in 2012.
EBITDA Our total EBITDA increased by 26.3% from 54.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 to 69.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily

<<<

 as a result of a combination of the implementation of price increases in each of our BI, TI and PPS divisions, improvements being made with respect to product mix as part of our continued focus on sales of higher margin, value-added HVAC products

<<<

, an increase in PPS volumes driven by a significant rise in the level of market activity (particularly in Sweden and Norway) and significant foreign exchange translation gains, partially offset by the incurrence of one-off costs in connection

<<<

 with the expansion of our Russian operations and the construction of Tver Line 1.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity describes our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of our business operations

<<<

, including our working capital needs, debt service obligations, capital expenditures, contractual obligations and other commitments, as well as acquisitions. Historically, our primary sources of liquidity have been cash generated from our operating

<<<

 activities and borrowings under our Existing Senior Facility.

Cash flows The following table sets forth the principal components of our cash flows for the periods presented.

 operating activities
Our net cash from operating activities increased by 36.3% from 43.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 to 59.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily as a result of a 6.9 million decrease in working

<<<

 capital in the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase in cash flow from operations of 4.8 million for the year (predominantly as a result of an underlying increase in EBITDA of 7.6 million for the year) and a lower net interest paid of 

<<<

3.5 million, partially offset by a higher tax expense for the year in the amount of 1.0 million.
Our net cash from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2012 remained generally flat at 43.9 million, compared to 43.8 million for

<<<

 the year ended December 31, 2011.

Cash flow from investing activities

Our net cash used in investing activities increased by 64.5% from 38.0 million in the year ended

December 31, 2012 to 62.5 million in the year ended December 31,

201

<<<

3,primarily as a result

Russian expansion project moving into a more capital intensive phase.

Our net cash used in investing activities increased by 57.8% from 24.1 million in the year ended

December 31, 2011 to 38.0 million in the year ended

<<<

 December 31,

2012,primarily as a result

commencement of construction works on the brownfield site on which our new manufacturing facility in

Tver is located and related capital outlays.

Cash flow from financing activities
Our net cash used

<<<

 in financing activities increased by 167.9% from 0.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 to 0.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily as a result of changes in pension and finance lease liabilities.
Our net cash used

<<<

 in financing activities decreased by 55.2% from 0.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 to 0.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily as a result of changes in pension and finance lease liabilities.

Cash and cash equivalents

<<<


Our cash and cash equivalents comprise (i) cash at bank, principally denominated in euro, Swedish kronor, Polish zloty, Norwegian kroner and Russian roubles, and (ii) cash equivalents, primarily consisting of short term deposits for up to three

<<<

 months.

Working capital
To finance our working capital requirements, from the Issue Date we will have available our New Revolving Credit Facility, pursuant to which we may draw up to 60 million for general corporate

of ou of th

97

purposes

<<<

. We do not expect any amounts to be drawn under our New Revolving Credit Facility as of the Issue Date.
Our business has a relatively predictable working capital cycle and generally mirrors developments in our operating business, as well as

<<<

 underlying activity in the construction industry, over the course of each year. Accordingly, our working capital has a seasonal trend and certain seasonal patterns may cause material fluctuations in our working capital. In general, our working

<<<

 capital increases over the course of each year through the end of the third quarter. This upward trend is driven by an increase in inventories of finished goods and accounts receivable as trading increases in line with sales seasonality (whereby

<<<

 sales are weighted more towards the second half of each year). Working capital then generally decreases in the fourth quarter of each year as accounts receivable are collected, stocks of finished goods are lower and customer bonus accruals

<<<

 are typically at their highest level. Inventories of raw materials are generally higher in the first and fourth quarters of each year as deliveries become more limited during the winter months, whereas inventories of finished goods are typically

<<<

 built up over the course of the second and third quarters to cover the seasonal sales peak. In addition, each July we typically experience a decrease in our working capital balance as a result of the traditional Northern European holiday season

<<<

. Lower levels of trading and decreased sales over this holiday period usually result in a decline in our accounts receivable and consequently a significant decrease in our working capital. See also ``--Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations

<<<

-- Seasonality and weather conditions. ''
We monitor working capital on a monthly basis and continually seek to optimize working capital. For example, as a result of the implementation of a project to decrease accounts receivable, we achieved

<<<

 a reduction in the number of debtor days (defined as the product of (x) average accounts receivable for the financial year divided by total net sales for the financial year multiplied by (y) 365 days) from 44 debtor days in the year ended December

<<<

 31, 2011 to 41 debtor days in the year ended December 31, 2013. Furthermore, in 2013 we introduced an initiative designed to improve accounts payable turnover. As part of the initiative, payment terms with our smaller suppliers were renegotiated

<<<

 and any contracts having payment terms of less than 30 days are no longer accepted without the approval of senior management. As a result of this initiative, we achieved an increase in the number of creditor days (defined as the product of

<<<

 (x) average accounts payable for the financial year divided by total cost of goods sold for the financial year multiplied by (y) 365 days) from 43 creditor days in the year ended December 31, 2011 to 50 creditor days in the year ended December

Working capital decreased by 6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 20

<<<

13, driven primarily by (i) a decrease in trade and other receivables in the amount of 4.7 million, relating in part to a decline in trade receivables owing partially to a lower sales revenue in last two months of the year as compared to the

<<<

 corresponding months of the previous year and partially to the country mix (whereby Russian sales grew at a rate that was generally higher than the Group's average growth rate and on substantially shorter average payment terms), as well as

<<<

 a decline in certain other receivables (mainly in connection with the return of a security deposit in relation to currency hedge arrangements entered into in connection with our Russian expansion), partially offset through adverse foreign exchange

<<<

 effects, (ii) an increase in inventories in the amount of 2.3 million, relating primarily to the build-up of inventories of raw materials at our new manufacturing facility in Tver in connection with the commencement of its manufacturing operations

<<<

 and to a lesser extent an adverse foreign exchange effect, (iii) an increase in trade and other payables in the amount of 3.9 million, relating primarily to the implementation of a more stringent Group supplier payment policy (demanding at

<<<

 least 30 days payment terms for smaller suppliers), as well as a run rate effect of the improved vendor invoices circulation, materially offset through a decline in the accrued expenses and VAT payables, but supported through a favourable foreign

Capital expenditures

O ur capital expenditures can principally be divided into two categories:

<<<



 m aintenance capital expenditures, w hich are capital expenditures required to sustain the ongoing perform ance of our operations or otherw ise adjust our operations to adhere to legislative or regulatory requirem ents, including capital

<<<

 expenditures relating to m aintenance and replacem ent of plant and equipm ent, environm ental m atters and occupational health and safety; and

 strategic growth investm ents, w hich are capital expenditures designed to enhance productivity

<<<

, achieve cost savings or gain a particular com m ercial advantage, including expansionary capital expenditures.

W e finance ou r capital expenditures prim arily o u t o f our cash flow from operations.

Our total capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013 were 23.2 million, 37.2 million and

<<<

 58.6 million, respectively.
Maintenance capital expenditures remained generally stable during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013 at 10.3 million and 10.6 million, respectively. However, during the year ended December 31, 2011, maintenance

<<<

 capital expenditures were significantly higher at 15.8 million due to the implementation of several large one-off projects which impacted our results of operations. For example, we replaced a packaging end at our manufacturing facility in Oulu

<<<

, installed a sulphur cleaning system at our manufacturing facility in Hallekis and added module machines and robot palletizers to the packing ends at our manufacturing facility in Parainen.
Strategic growth investments with respect to Russia

<<<

 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013 were 1.4 million, 16.9 million and 41.0 million, respectively. The significant increase in investment which occurred during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013 can be attributed to

<<<

 the commencement of our Russian expansion and the construction of Tver Line 1.
Strategic growth investments excluding those made with respect to Russia remained relatively stable at 6.0 million, 9.9 million and 7.0 million for the years ended

<<<

 December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively, although the slight increase which occurred in the year ended December 31, 2012 was attributable to a new pipe section machine at our Trzemeszno manufacturing facility and a higher spend generally

<<<

 with respect to productivity and market-related investments.
Historically, the split between maintenance capital expenditures and strategic growth investments has been relatively equal. However, in recent years, maintenance capital expenditures

<<<

 have taken precedence to our strategic growth investments outside Russia as a result of the extra capital we have been required to commit in connection with our Russian expansion. While we believe that our plants are generally in good condition

<<<

 and adequate for our existing needs, we will be required to continue to invest in our manufacturing facilities in order to improve productivity, product quality and energy efficiency, as well as to expand capacity to meet expected demand for

<<<

 our existing and potential new products. As a supplier of premium stone wool products, maintenance and replacement measures in our plants are essential to continuously provide the required product quality. Furthermore, although maintenance

<<<

 capital expenditures have remained relatively steady over the last two years, we may be required to make increased levels of maintenance capital expenditures in the future as we start to operate at higher utilization rates.
For the year ended

<<<

 December 31, 2014, and excluding any potential acquisitions, we expect our total capital expenditures will be approximately 23 million, which includes approximately 3 million currently committed in connection with the potential second phase

<<<

 of our Russian expansion. See "--Key Factors Affecting Our Future Results of Operations--Further Russian expansion'' and "Business--Divisions--Russian expansion.'' The second phase of our Russian expansion remains subject to internal approval

<<<

, which we would not expect to receive prior to the second half of 2014. In the event that we proceed with the second phase of our Russian expansion, we estimate that we will make total capital expenditures in the amount of approximately 75

<<<

 million during the 18 to 24 month period following any decision to proceed with the project. We expect that we would fund these capital expenditures using cash generated by our operating activities.
In connection with the planned closure of

<<<

 our Lappeenranta manufacturing facility in 2016, we estimate that we will incur capital expenditures of approximately 7 million in connection with the transfer process, as well as demolition, land clearing and remediation costs of approximately

<<<

 9 million. Furthermore, we expect that we will incur productivity losses, labor efficiency losses and other incremental costs during the transfer period. See ``--Key Factors Affecting Our Future Results o f Operations--Lappeenranta closure

<<<

" and "Business--Divisions--Production facilities and inter-segment sales--Lappeenranta closure."
See also "--Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations-- Geographic expansion and capital expenditures. "
Long-term indebtedness outstanding

<<<

 upon completion of the Transactions
We currently have, and upon consummation of the Transactions we will continue to have, a significant amount of outstanding indebtedness with substantial debt service requirements. As of December 31, 2013

<<<

, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions as described in "Use of Proceeds," our total outstanding indebtedness (excluding finance leases and shareholder loans) would have been 430 million.
100

Upon consummation of the Transactions

<<<

 as described in "Use of Proceeds", our long-term indebtedness will consist primarily of the Notes and the New Revolving Credit Facility (which provides for certain maintenance covenants). For a description of the material terms of our long

<<<

-term indebtedness, see ``Description of Other Indebtedness" and "Description of the Notes."
Initially, we will have 60 million available to be drawn under our New Revolving Credit Facility as of the Issue Date. In connection with the Transactions

<<<

, our SEK 35 million Pensions L/C will be rolled into our New Revolving Credit Facility as a letter of credit issued under an ancillary facility thereunder on the Issue Date. Such ancillary facility utilisation by the Pensions L/C will thereby

<<<

 reduce amounts available for drawing under our 60 million New Revolving Credit Facility as of the Issue Date by the corresponding euro equivalent amount. See ``-- Contractual Obligations--Pension obligations."
We do not otherwise expect our

<<<

 New Revolving Credit Facility to be drawn as of the Issue Date.
We are highly leveraged and we may undertake further expansion and make additional investments in the future which may increase our level of indebtedness. Our ability to make scheduled

<<<

 payments of principal of, or to pay interest on, or to refinance, our indebtedness (including the Notes), or to fund planned capital expenditures and working capital, will depend on our future performance and our ability to generate cash, which

<<<

, to a certain extent, will be subject to general economic, financial, competitive, market, legal, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control, including those factors discussed under "Risk Factors" and "Forward-Looking Statements

<<<

."
We believe that our cash flow from operating activities and borrowings under our New Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures and debt service requirements as

<<<

 they become due. We cannot, however, assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities, that our currently anticipated sales development, cost savings and operating improvements will be realized, or that

<<<

 future borrowings will be available under our New Revolving Credit Facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. See "Risk Factors--Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure

<<<

-- We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt and sustain our debt and sustain our operations. Our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors beyond our control."

<<<

 from operations.
(4) Purchase commitments primarily relate to commitments to purchase energy (including electricity and natural gas), raw materials (including coke, packaging materials and briquettes) and other components.

Pension obligations

<<<


In addition to the contractual obligations shown in the table above, we have significant pension obligations, of which 10.1 million were unfunded as of December 31, 2013.
We provide company-sponsored pension arrangements to our employees in

<<<

 Finland, Sweden, Norway, Lithuania, Germany and the United Kingdom. For the most part, these pension arrangements are either defined contribution plans, or are accounted for as defined contribution plans, or are defined benefit plans which

<<<

 are fully-insured and financed through the payment of regular premiums, which means we retain no financial risk in respect of past service benefits under those plans. However, in Sweden, we have defined benefit arrangements in place for certain

<<<

 "white-collar" employees, a portion of which are unfunded and not otherwise insured. To the extent that a plan is not fully funded or insured, we are required to recognize a liability for the relevant amount in our consolidated financial statements

<<<

. Accordingly, a liability of 10.1 million has been included on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2013 in respect of our unfunded pension obligations, while our consolidated income statement for the year ended December 31, 2

<<<

013 includes a charge to earnings in the amount of 0.4 million in respect of the cost of interest on the related liabilities.
Our defined benefit obligations are based on certain actuarial assumptions that can vary according to discount rates

<<<

, life expectancies and rates of increase in compensation levels. If actual results, especially discount rates or life expectancies, were to differ from our assumptions, our pension obligations could be higher than expected and we could incur

<<<

 re-measurements (gains or losses). Changes in all assumptions or under-performance of plan assets could also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Future declines in the value of plan assets or lower-than-expected

<<<

 returns may require us to make additional current cash payments to pension plans or non-cash charges to other comprehensive income. However, our current defined benefit plans do not include plan assets as defined by IAS 19.
In connection with

<<<

 our unfunded pension obligations in Sweden, we are required to obtain credit insurance with PRI Pensionsgaranti, which provides insurance annually against the risk of our insolvency. Each year, PRI Pensionsgaranti sets its premiums based on

<<<

, among other things, a measurement of the relevant pension liabilities, which is determined using methods and assumptions that differ from the IFRS (IAS 19) measurement. As of December 31, 2013, the cost of our premiums with PRI Pensionsgaranti

<<<

 amounted to 1.0% of the first SEK 35 million of the relevant pension liabilities plus 0.3% of the relevant pension liabilities in excess of SEK 35 million. PRI Pensionsgaranti can also require companies to provide additional security with respect

<<<

 to their pension arrangements and, in extreme circumstances, can require companies to insure the pension benefits with a third party. We estimate that the cost of doing this would be approximately SEK 95 million (or approximately 10.7 million

<<<

). We currently have a letter of credit in place with ING Bank N.V, London Branch (the ``Pensions L/C") to cover the first SEK 35 million (or approximately 4.0 million) of any unpaid pension obligations, as well as a parent company guarantee

<<<

 to cover any liabilities over and above SEK 35 million. In connection with the Transactions, the Pensions L/C will be rolled into our New Revolving Credit Facility as a letter of credit issued under an ancillary facility

102

thereunder on

<<<

 or about the Issue Date. Such ancillary facility utilisation by the Pensions L/C will thereby reduce amounts available for drawing under our 60 million New Revolving Credit Facility as of the Issue Date by the corresponding euro equivalent

<<<

 amount.
Environmental obligations
Provisions for environmental obligations primarily relate to covering the cost of landscaping and any other work needed to return a quarry or dumpsite to a safe and environmentally acceptable condition once

<<<

 the quarry or dumpsite has been closed. As of December 31, 2013, we had provisions for environmental obligations in the amount of 7.3 million, primarily to cover demolishing costs and other costs associated with the planned closure of our Lappeenranta

<<<

 manufacturing facility. We expect to incur these demolishing costs by the end of 2018. See "Business--Divisions--Production facilities and intersegment sales-- Lappeenranta closure."
Contingent Liabilities
We have an open case with regard to

<<<

 transfer pricing practices at Paroc Oy Ab for the period 2006 through 2008. The Finnish tax authorities have made a tax reassessment concerning that period, and based on tax decisions rendered by the Finnish tax authorities in 2012 and 201

<<<

3, Paroc Oy Ab would be required to pay 22.3 million in taxes, penalties and interest. The amount includes 14.1 million of taxes, 2.3 million of surtax and 5.9 million of accrued corporate interest and penalty interest (through December 31,

<<<

 2013). Our view with respect to the transfer pricing of the Group's intra-group supply of raw materials, license fees and distributor services differs from that of the Finnish tax authorities, and in February 2013 we filed an appeal against

<<<

 the tax reassessment with the Board of Appeals. We have been granted an interdiction of payment related to the reassessed tax payments. This interdiction of payment is in force until the earlier of such time as the Board of Appeals renders

<<<

 a decision on the matter or January 31, 2015. If the appeal is lost, we will be obligated to pay the taxes, penalties and interest, absent any successful subsequent appeal by us. We have not made a provision in our financial statements for

<<<

 the year ended December 31, 2014, since management believes, supported by external legal advice that all transfer pricing guidelines have been followed and the same method has been followed from 2009 to 2013. If we lose the appeal and any subsequent

<<<

 appeals, we may be required to pay additional taxes, penalties and interest for the period from 2009 to 2013. See ``Risk Factors--Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry-- We are subject to risks from legal proceedings."
In addition

<<<

 to the appeal to the Board of Appeals, we have also made protective applications for a Mutual Agreement Procedure ("MAP"). A MAP provides for a corresponding adjustment to be agreed in another jurisdiction when a transfer pricing adjustment

<<<

 is applied, so that it is not a one-sided adjustment (i.e., additional income in Finland would have resulted in reduced profits in the corresponding Group entity, based in another territory). A MAP does not cover surtaxes and interest. Due

<<<

 to, for example, differences in tax rates and tax positions of the relevant affiliated entities, part of the additional taxes payable in Finland cannot be recovered through a MAP. We have filed an application for a MAP with the relevant authorities

<<<

 in Poland, Sweden, Lithuania, Estonia, Denmark, Germany and Latvia (all based on the EU Arbitration Convention), and with the relevant authorities in Russia and Norway (based on tax treaties). MAP procedures can take a considerable amount of

<<<

 time; MAP negotiations based on the EU Arbitration Convention are limited to two years, after which time the case is referred to the advisory commission for resolution within 12 months. For intra-EU MAP procedures, a decision is to be reached

<<<

 between the two relevant tax authorities, providing relief for any additional income that is assessed in Finland through the open tax case. The amount of tax recoverable through an intra-EU MAP is approximately 8 million to 12 million. For

<<<

 MAP negotiations based on tax treaties, there is no set time frame or possibility to refer the case to an advisory commission in case the authorities do not reach a conclusion. The amount of tax recoverable through a tax treaty based MAP is

<<<

 approximately 2 million. The surtaxes and interest (8.2 million) cannot be recovered through a MAP. The Finnish Competent Authorities will not start the MAP negotiations in our case until the appeal process is complete.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

<<<


Other than as described above, we are not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material impact on our liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.

Quantitative and Qualitative

 Disclosures about Market Risk
Exchange rate risk
We are exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates. Although our reporting currency for purposes of our consolidated financial statements is the euro, a significant portion of our business is conducted

<<<

 in currencies other than the euro, including the Swedish krona, the Norwegian krone, the Danish krone, the Lithuanian litas, the Polish zloty, the Russian rouble and the British pound. Excluding sales denominated in the Latvian lats (which

<<<

 was replaced by the euro as of January 1, 2014) and the Lithuanian litas (which is pegged to the euro), we generated approximately 59% of our revenue in currencies other than the euro during the year ended December 31, 2013; namely the Swedish

<<<

 krona (accounting for approximately 30% of our total revenue), the Russian rouble (accounting for approximately 8% of our total revenue), the Norwegian krone (accounting for approximately 7% of our total revenue), the Polish zloty (accounting

<<<

 for approximately 6% of our total revenue), the Danish krone (accounting for approximately 3% of our total revenue) and the British pound (accounting for approximately 2% of our total revenue). As a result, we are exposed to currency translation

<<<

 risk when the results of our subsidiaries that have a functional currency other than the euro are converted into euro for purposes of our consolidated financial statements. In connection therewith, the profits and losses of our subsidiaries

<<<

 with a functional currency other than the euro are translated into euro at average exchange rates, while assets and liabilities are translated into euro at the closing exchange rate as of the date of the applicable statement of financial position

<<<

. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect the value of our foreign assets, sales, liabilities and costs when reported in euro and will therefore give rise to period-on-period differences in our results of operations. Therefore

<<<

, if the euro appreciates (particularly in relation to the Swedish krona, the Russian rouble, the Norwegian krone, the Polish zloty, the Danish krone and the British pound) and our sales and expenses denominated in foreign currencies remain

<<<

 the same (or, in some cases, even if our sales increase or our expenses decrease), the euro value of the contribution to our consolidated results of operations and financial condition of our subsidiaries that have a functional currency other

<<<

 than the euro will be reduced and our euro-denominated consolidated revenues and profits will decline. Exchange rates between the euro and the other currencies in which we conduct our business, particularly the Swedish krona, the Russian rouble

<<<

, the Norwegian krone, the Polish zloty, the Danish krone and the British pound, have fluctuated in recent years and may continue to do so in the future. Based on our sales denominated in Swedish kronor, Russian roubles, Norwegian kroner, Polish

<<<

 zloty, Danish kroner and British pounds in the year ended December 31, 2013, a depreciation of 5% in each of the Swedish krona, the Russian rouble, the Norwegian krone, the Polish zloty, the Danish krone and the British pound against the euro

<<<

 would have resulted in a decrease in our consolidated sales of approximately 6.5 million, 1.6 million, 1.5 million, 1.4 million, 0.7 million and 0.5 million, respectively.
In general, our subsidiaries generate revenue and incur expenses in

<<<

 their respective operating or functional currencies. This means we face relatively limited transaction-related exposure from our operating activities. However, we do face some transaction risk, primarily as a result of sales being made out

<<<

 of Finland into Sweden and Norway, out of Sweden into Norway and Denmark and out of Poland into Germany and the United Kingdom. Net currency exposure from sales made by our operating subsidiaries denominated in currencies other than the functional

<<<

 currency of the relevant operating subsidiary arises only to the extent that we do not incur corresponding expenses in the same foreign currencies. Such net currency exposure may occur in relation to countries in which we do not operate production

<<<

 facilities (for example, Norway and Denmark) and therefore need to source our goods from other, typically neighboring, countries with other functional currencies, or in relation to countries in which we operate production facilities (for example

<<<

, Poland and Russia) but need to source certain raw materials in a currency other than the functional currency of the relevant country. In order to reduce our net exposure from foreign currency exchange fluctuations, we purchase and intend to

<<<

 continue to purchase certain raw materials to a large extent in the local currencies of the relevant operating companies. Despite such purchases in local currencies, there are certain raw materials (for example, coke) that need to be sourced

<<<

 in currencies other than the relevant local currency, particularly in euro. Accordingly, the risk from foreign currency exposure related to sales denominated in currencies other than the euro can only partly be offset by local currencydenominated

<<<

 expenditures incurred at the level of our operating companies.
We mitigate the risk of fluctuations in exchange rates through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts. Specifically, we forecast our cash flows by currency on a rolling six

<<<

-month basis and hedge between 60% and 80% of those estimated cash flows, calculated on a Group basis. Currency translation exposure is not hedged. While our hedging strategy enables us to partly mitigate the effects on our cash flows of an

<<<

 appreciation of the value of the euro compared to the respective functional currencies of our
104

foreign subsidiaries over the relevant period, it does not enable us to mitigate the risk of a long-term appreciation of the euro compared to

<<<

 the respective functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries. Furthermore, we are also subject to foreign currency effects linked to loans (including intercompany loans) made in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity

<<<

 advancing or receiving those loans. For example, we currently have an outstanding SEK-denominated intercompany loan from Paroc Group Oy (the functional currency of which is the euro) to Paroc Sverige AB (the functional currency of which is

<<<

 the Swedish krona) which, as of December 31, 2013, had a book value of 225.8 million. Due to favorable exchange rate movements that have occurred during the period since the intercompany loan was made, Paroc Group Oy is likely to realize a

<<<

 substantial taxable gain upon repayment of the intercompany loan, which repayment may occur in connection with the Transactions. See "Risk Factors--Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry-- Currency rate and interest rate fluctuations

<<<

 might adversely affect our financial position and results of operations"
Interest rate risk
We have, and after the Transactions we will continue to have, a significant amount of long-term indebtedness which bears interest at variable rates

<<<

, including under our New Revolving Credit Facility and the Floating Rate Notes. As a result, we are exposed to fluctuations or variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates. If interest rates increase, our interest expense

<<<

 will also increase, and conversely, if interest rates decrease, our interest expense will also decrease. After giving pro forma effect to the Transactions and calculating pro forma cash interest expense on the Notes based upon, with respect

<<<

 to the Fixed Rate Notes, the interest rate of the Fixed Rate Notes and, with respect to the Floating Rate Notes, the margin over three-month EURIBOR, as if the Transactions had occurred on January 1, 2013, a 0.125% increase in our variable

<<<

 interest rates would have resulted in additional cash interest expense of approximately 0.29 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Through our Group treasury, we monitor market conditions and may from time to time implement appropriate

<<<

 measures to manage interest rate risk, including the utilization of approved interest rate derivatives. As of December 31, 2013, our 350 million Existing Senior Notes were fully hedged through interest rate swaps until February 2015, pursuant

<<<

 to which we pay fixed interest and receive a floating interest rate linked to three-month EURIBOR. As part of the Transactions, we intend to unwind and terminate our outstanding interest rate swaps that we previously entered into in connection

<<<

 with our 350 million Existing Senior Notes. We may decide to put hedging in place for our New Revolving Credit Facility, our Floating Rate Notes or any other variable rate debt obligations we may have outstanding from time to time in the future

<<<

.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to fulfill present or future obligations if we do not have sufficient funds available to meet such obligations. Liquidity risk arises mostly in relation to cash flows generated and

<<<

 used in financing activities, and particularly by servicing our debt, in terms of both interest and principal, and our payment obligations relating to our ordinary business activities.
We believe that the potential risks to our liquidity include

<<<

:
 a reduction in cash flow from operating activities due to a decrease in revenues, which could be due to economic, financial, competitive, market, legal, regulatory and other factors beyond our control;
 adverse working capital developments

<<<

;
 seasonal effects impacting our business operations;
 exposure to increased interest rates in relation to our borrowings that bear interest at a variable rate, including our Floating Rate Notes and our New Revolving Credit Facility; and

<<<


 higher levels of capital expenditure, including in connection with further investment initiatives to grow production capacity.
If our future cash flow from operating activities and other capital resources (including borrowings under our New

<<<

 Revolving Credit Facility) are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:
 reduce or delay our business activities and planned capital expenditures;
 reduce or delay our planned

<<<

 acquisitions;
 sell assets;
105

 obtain additional debt or equity capital; or
 restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity.
We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish

<<<

 any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of our debt, including the Notes and our New Revolving Credit Facility, limit our ability to pursue these alternatives, as may the terms

<<<

 of any future debt.
Our liquidity is managed centrally by our Group treasury, which monitors liquidity on a daily basis. Under our treasury policy, we remit all excess cash within the Group to our Group treasury, which takes internal deposits

<<<

 and pays interest based on the financial transactions transfer pricing policy. Any Group companies which require financing can consequently borrow funds internally from our Group treasury. We operate cross-border cash pools that aim to improve

<<<

 the utilization of our liquidity. Our Group treasury makes short-term external deposits with approved banking counterparties that have a rating in short-term obligations of at least P-1 (Moody's) or similar. We give greater focus to security

<<<

 of funds than investment yield. We have set our minimum level of cash available at 25 million, including cash at bank and on hand and overdraft facilities.
Credit risk
Our main exposure to credit risk relates to trade receivables and other

<<<

 financial assets, including cash and cash equivalents. We have no significant concentration of third-party credit risk due to the large number of customers we have spread across our markets. We have adopted risk management procedures to both

<<<

 reduce and monitor credit risk. We perform ongoing credit quality evaluations of our customers and use external debt collection agencies under certain circumstances. In addition, we have insured against credit risk with respect to our trade

<<<

 receivables in all significant countries. All insured sales in excess of 5,000 are covered by a deductible of 10%. We also have our own internal credit policy, which specifies the principles that will operate in the event that an insurance

<<<

 company does not grant a limit to the relevant customer. In these cases, division management will have the power to grant an internal limit up to 100,000, beyond which authorization must lie with our chief financial officer and chief executive

<<<

 officer. We monitor the status of trade receivables on a weekly basis. We record a provision on the balance sheet for any trade and other accounts receivable overdue by more than 180 days or which are recognized as doubtful. We recorded a provision

<<<

 for doubtful receivables in the amount of 0.4 million as of December 31, 2013.
Credit risk with respect to our other financial assets, primarily comprising cash and cash equivalents, arises from the risk that the relevant counterparty becomes

<<<

 insolvent and is unable to return the deposited funds as a result of the insolvency. To mitigate this risk, we seek to transact and deposit funds with high-quality financial institutions that we deem to be creditworthy, and we monitor transaction

<<<

 volumes in order to reduce the risk of concentration of our transactions with any single counterparty.
Commodity price risk
We are exposed to commodity price risk from price volatility with respect to raw materials, energy and other input factors

<<<

 for our production processes. Raw materials (including stone, coke, binder, steel, coatings and adhesives) and electricity used in our production processes represent a significant proportion of our cost of sales. Collectively, raw materials

<<<

 and energy cost accounted for 36% of our cost of sales in the year ended December 31, 2013. See "--Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations--Raw materials and energy cost.' The prices for our raw materials and energy requirements have

<<<

 fluctuated significantly in the past for a variety of reasons, many of which are beyond our control. In particular, we have experienced significant volatility with respect to coke prices in recent years. Coke prices spiked in 2011 with an increase

<<<

 in price of approximately 28% over the previous year, but over the course of 2012 and 2013 prices have declined significantly. The falling price of coke over the last two years has been partially offset by an increase in the price of binder

<<<

. Binder pricing fluctuates from year to year and is impacted mainly by movements in the market price for certain constituent chemicals (namely phenol, urea and methanol), as well as any material changes in the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate

<<<

. The average price for binder has increased in each of the last three years. Together, coke and binder represented approximately 50% of our total raw material costs for the year ended December 31, 2013. Our total energy cost is driven by cost

<<<

 for the supply of electricity used in connection with our furnace processes. In the year ended December 31, 2013, our total energy cost (excluding coke) amounted to 27.5 million and accounted for 9% of our cost of sales.
106

In order to manage

<<<

 the risk of fluctuations in raw material and energy prices, we enter into supply agreements covering significant portions of our expected raw material and energy requirements for set periods of time, which may be on a monthly, quarterly, semi

<<<

-annual or annual basis depending on the nature of the supply agreement. If raw material or energy prices decline after we have entered into the relevant supply agreement, we may have to pay prices under the agreement which are in excess of

<<<

 prevailing spot market prices, which may adversely impact our results of operations. We also seek to mitigate the risk of fluctuations in raw materials cost by implementing measures designed to improve efficiency of consumption, as well as

<<<

 using alternative, cheaper raw materials where possible. For example, with respect to stone, we generally try to source our supply locally and as close as possible to our manufacturing facilities and often seek to substitute virgin stone for

<<<

 cheaper industrial residual materials. With respect to coke, most of our requirements are now sourced on a quarterly basis from suppliers in Poland and Ukraine, on a semi-annual basis from suppliers in Spain and on an occasional basis from

<<<

 suppliers in Italy, which means we benefit from a better security of supply and improved logistics, working capital and price leverage as compared to our previous arrangements with suppliers in China. Coke prices are negotiated largely based

<<<

 on Australian coking coal price trends. For example, the significant spike that we experienced in 2011 with respect to coke prices was primarily the result of severe flooding in Queensland, which is a key region in the global supply of coking

<<<

 coal. With respect to binder, pricing under our current supply arrangements is agreed each month on a spot basis and is indexed to price movements in phenol, urea and methanol. With respect to electricity, we consume approximately half of our

<<<

 electricity requirements in Sweden and Finland, with the remaining half consumed in Lithuania and Poland. Under our electricity hedging policy, we mitigate the risk of fluctuations in electricity prices in Sweden and Finland by estimating our

<<<

 electricity consumption over a rolling three-year period and fixing prices each year for a specified percentage of our estimated usage for that year. We fix prices for between 75% and 85% of our estimated consumption in the first year, between

<<<

 35% and 45% in the second year and between 10% and 20% in the third year. In Lithuania and Poland, we enter into long-term contracts with the relevant suppliers and fix prices for our electricity consumption on an annual basis. Although historically

<<<

 we have generally been able to pass on increases in costs with respect to raw materials and energy to our customers by increasing prices for our products, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future. See ``-- Competition

<<<

 and pricing'' below. See also "Risk Factors--Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry-- Our business may be negatively affected by volatility in raw and other material prices, our inability to retain or replace our key suppliers, unexpected

<<<

 supply shortages and disruptions o f the supply chain'' and "--Increased energy cost or disruptions in energy supplies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations."
Critical Accounting

<<<

 Policies and Estimates
This "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" discusses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS. The preparation of financial

<<<

 statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements

<<<

 and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the relevant period. Certain estimates and assumptions are particularly sensitive because of their complexity, and although estimates and assumptions are based on management's best knowledge

<<<

 of current events and circumstances, the actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates and assumptions, and such differences may be material. We evaluate such estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis based upon historical results

<<<

 and experience, in consultation with experts and using other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances, as well as our forecasts regarding future changes. Estimates and assumptions are particularly necessary for the measurement

<<<

 of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets (such as trademarks and goodwill) and non-current carbon dioxide emission certificates, as well as for the measurement of deferred taxes and warranty provisions.
This discussion of critical

<<<

 accounting policies and estimates is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all our accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by IFRS, with no need for management's

<<<

 judgment regarding accounting policy. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity.
107

Impairment testing for goodwill and other intangible assets
We

<<<

 test goodwill, intangible assets not yet available for use and intangible assets with indefinite lives (including the Paroc brand) for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that there might be

<<<

 impairment. The impairment test involves allocating goodwill and such other intangible assets to certain cash-generating units ("CGUs") based on the Group's reporting structure and making a determination of fair value. When the fair value is

<<<

 lower than the carrying amount of the relevant CGU, an impairment charge is recognized on the goodwill allocated to the CGU. Any impairment charges arising as a result of the impairment test are recognized in the statement of comprehensive

<<<

 income. The allocation of goodwill to a CGU and the determination of fair value require assumptions and estimates with respect to future cash flows which are based on business expectations, discount rates and other factors which may change

<<<

 over time. Changes in future projected cash flows and discount rates applied may lead to impairment charges in future periods. See "Note 2--Summary of significant accounting policies--Uncertainty related to critical accounting estimates--Impairment

<<<

 testing'' and "Note 12--Intangible assets'' of our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.
Income taxes and deferred tax assets and liabilities
Management judgment is required in connection

<<<

 with the calculation of the provision for income taxes and deferred tax assets and liabilities. At each balance sheet date, management reviews the carrying amount of deferred tax assets and liabilities and exercises judgment as to whether it

<<<

 is probable that our subsidiaries will have sufficient taxable income against which unused tax losses or unused tax credits can be utilized. We have recorded significant deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are expected to affect our

<<<

 operating results over future periods. The various factors on which management's judgment is based may differ from the actual outcome (for example, tax laws may be enacted that impose restrictions on the realization of deferred tax assets,

<<<

 or the level of actual taxable income may not be sufficient in the future), which could lead to significant adjustments being made to the amount of deferred tax assets expensed in the statement of income and affect our operating results. See

<<<

 "Note 2--Summary of significant accounting policies-- Uncertainty related to critical accounting estimates--Income taxes'' of our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.
Pension obligations

<<<

 and employee benefits
We operate a mixture of pension and other post-employment benefit schemes. Several statistical and other actuarial assumptions are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans. These factors include

<<<

, among others, assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and changes in future compensation. Statistical information used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, changes

<<<

 in service period of plan participants or changes in other factors. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period

<<<

 in which they arise. Significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the future amounts of the defined benefit obligation and future expense. See "Note 2--Summary of significant accounting

<<<

 policies--Uncertainty related to critical accounting estimates--Employee benefits'' of our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
The following standards

<<<

 and interpretations (in some cases revised or amended) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ("I4SB") and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee ("IFRIC") were mandatory for the first time effective

<<<

 from January 1, 2013 and applied by us during the year ended December 31, 2013:
 Amendment to IAS 19 (Employee Benefits)--The amendment eliminates the so-called "corridor approach'' and mandates recognition of all actuarial gains and losses

<<<

 directly in other comprehensive income as they occur. Furthermore, all past service costs are to be recognized immediately and finance costs are calculated on a net funding basis.
 IFRS 13 (Fair Value Measurement)--The new standard aims to

<<<

 improve consistency and reduce complexity by providing a precise definition of fair value and a single source of fair value measurement with additional disclosure requirements for use across various effective IFRSs. Fair value is defined as

<<<

 the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
108

orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). The fair value of a liability therefore reflects non-performance

<<<

 risk. The requirements, now largely aligned between IFRS and U.S. GAAP, do not mandate or extend the use of fair value accounting, but provide guidance on how to apply fair value measurements where already required or permitted by other standards

<<<

. We have not experienced any significant impact on our net assets, financial position and results of operations as a result of the adoption of the new or amended standards described above. For information regarding new or amended standards

<<<

 and interpretations issued by the IASB and IFRIC which are not yet effective, and which have not yet been adopted by the Group in its consolidated financial statements, see "Note 2--Summary of significant accounting policies--Standards, amendments

<<<

 and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective" of our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

INDUSTRY
Introduction
The insulation industry is an integral part of

<<<

 the construction industry and is thus directly affected by developments and changes in activity in the construction sector. Several macroeconomic factors influence the size and growth of the construction industry, including changes in GDP growth

<<<

 rates, changes in household income and inflation, business cycles, government debt, the availability of credit for potential home owners and investors, tax incentives and subsidies, interest rate levels, the state of the housing market and

<<<

 demographic trends. Historically, levels of construction output have demonstrated a strong correlation with general economic growth: during periods of GDP growth, construction output generally increases and during periods of stagnating or decreasing

<<<

 GDP, construction output decreases. Because we also operate in the technical insulation sector, we are also affected by developments in the wider industrials sector which is correlated to industrial production growth and in turn to GDP growth

<<<

. See "Risk Factors--Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry--Difficult conditions in the general economy and the global financial markets may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and

<<<

 the majority of our sales are concentrated in a limited number of markets'' and "-- The construction industry is cyclical in nature and subject to seasonality. ''
Insulation is used extensively in the construction industry as well as in niche

<<<

 segments of manufacturing and process industries. Insulation is a key input factor to reduce energy and temperature loss from buildings or machinery, offer protection against fire, improve sound insulation and room acoustics. In buildings,

<<<

 insulation can dramatically reduce energy consumption, and of currently available technologies, is the cheapest way to increase energy efficiency. In light of heightening global concerns as to greenhouse gas emission, energy security and efficiency

<<<

 and costs and ongoing and related regulatory scrutiny, these qualities provide a strong driver for developers and regulators to increasingly seek to use or demand the use of high-quality insulation.
We therefore believe that our industry as

<<<

 a whole and our end markets in particular stand to benefit from a favorable long-term regulatory environment in the medium-term, driven by a Europe-wide governmental commitment to improve energy efficiency standards and reduce energy consumption

<<<

 and cost, which should lead to an increase in the intensity of insulation use. We believe that insulation is viewed by regulators as a relatively simple and impactful way to achieve these objectives, given that: (i) several recent market studies

<<<

 have concluded that buildings represent around 40% of energy consumption in the European Union, providing a significant opportunity to reduce energy consumption; and (ii) improving insulation has been demonstrated as one of the most cost-effective

<<<

 ways to reduce CO2 emissions through reduced energy consumption, with a marginal cost of CO2 abatement significantly lower than other energyefficiency initiatives.
Building Insulation Industry
Market Size and Growth
For the 19 countries reviewed

<<<

 by Euroconstruct (Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom) (the ``EC-19 Countries

<<<

"), the 2013 market volume for residential construction is estimated to have been 583.0 billion, with 227.2 billion for new construction, while the market volume for non-residential construction is estimated to have been 417.0 billion, with

<<<

 214.6 billion for new construction.
The development of the market for building insulation is linked to the level of construction activity which has historically been linked to general economic growth. However, residential and non-residential

<<<

 construction activities may decrease earlier in general economic downturns and may also experience cyclical recoveries with some delay. Historically, cycles in major geographic markets have not occurred in parallel as a result of which manufacturers

<<<

 of building materials active in different geographic markets have, to a certain degree, benefited from offsetting effects.
In the cyclical development of the construction industry, 2007 represented the end of an extended period of growth that

<<<

 peaked in 2006, when construction in Europe grew faster than GDP for that year (3.8% in construction compared against 3.1% in GDP growth), according to Euroconstruct.
Though the total construction output has generally decreased year-on-year

<<<

 since the onset of the financial crisis in 2007 (with the exception of 2011), Euroconstruct forecasts indicate that this trend is expected to
110

reverse in 2014. In 2013, volumes were substantially lower than their maximum values over the

<<<

 last ten years in most of our markets. For 2014, Euroconstruct forecasts positive construction volume outlooks for Sweden (1.6% growth), Finland (0.5% growth), Norway (3.6% growth) and Poland (3.5% growth). According to industry sources, there

<<<

 is a mixed overall outlook for the Baltic States as a whole in 2014, as falls in civil engineering activity may outweigh growth in residential and commercial construction.
For our building insulation products, we believe that the best indicator

<<<

 of demand in terms of volume is the new residential construction sector, which has in recent years been severely affected by strong declines in demand. From 2007 to 2010, the European market for new residential construction declined significantly

<<<

, according to Euroconstruct. The decline in residential construction activities has been particularly significant in those countries that previously experienced high levels of new residential construction activities, such as the Nordics, Spain

<<<

, Ireland and the United Kingdom. Growth and subsequent decline in the European markets for residential renovation, new commercial construction and commercial renovation have historically been less cyclical.
Since 2010, the Nordic and Baltic

<<<

 new residential sectors have remained flat, with many coming under pressure in the course of 2012 following a temporary recovery in 2011, due to the depressed macroeconomic environment in the euro zone, the tightening of public budgets, the

<<<

 challenging labor market and a decrease in consumer confidence. A potential acceleration in recovery is supported by structural demand from an aging building stock and an economic recovery in the near term.
Euroconstruct estimates that the

<<<

 compound annual growth rate for the residential construction output of all EC-19 Countries besides the Czech Republic and Spain will be positive for the period from 2013 to 2016. This reversal in trend is largely a result of increased demand

<<<

 following the improvement of economic prospects and the positive impact of demographic effects.
Market Structure
Demand
Stone wool is mainly used for insulation products used in residential, industrial and commercial construction. Stone wool

<<<

 products are also used in other applications, such as acoustics and fire protection. Alternative materials to stone wool insulation include glass wool and various foam-based insulation, such as Expanded Polystyrene ("EPS"), Rigid Polyurethane

<<<

 ("PUR") and Extruded Polystyrene ("XPS"). Individual application specifications may however impact the interchangeability of the insulation materials, and it is only in a relatively limited subset of applications where mineral wool insulation

<<<

 (comprising stone wool and glass wool) can be substituted for foam insulation. Mineral wool (comprising stone wool and glass wool) is the primary material used in building and technical insulation, with the highest market penetration. Mineral

<<<

 wool typically does not materially overlap with foam insulation in building or technical insulation uses. However, there is a material area of overlap between mineral wool and foam insulation in external facades and roofs, as well as in sandwich

<<<

 panels, where mineral wool and foams are relatively more substitutable. Within the category of mineral wool, stone wool and glass wool are close substitutes with relatively little differentiation in building insulation, and given the similarities

<<<

 in properties, application and production, the main competitor to stone wool is glass wool. The main advantage of stone wool is a higher fire resistance, which drives the higher share in process and marine segments. Stone wool is also generally

<<<

 perceived by customers to be easier to install. Glass wool in contrast is easier to transport than stone wool due to better compressibility and is cheaper than stone wool in low density insulation products. Typically, the choice of insulation

<<<

 used in construction activities varies by market and depends to a considerable degree on regional and local building traditions, exterior climate and applicable technical and legal construction requirements. In addition to specific requirement

<<<

 in the geographic markets, the choice of building material also depends on design requirements, relative product price, transportation and construction cost and brand and product awareness.
Distribution
In mature markets, building materials

<<<

, such as insulation, are predominantly sold through dealers (i.e., wholesale builders' merchants and do-it-yourself retail stores (DIY)) and, to a lesser degree (though subject to differences by regional markets), through direct sales to customers

<<<

. Sales activities of manufacturers of building materials differ significantly between dealer sales and direct sales.
In dealer sales the ultimate customers are typically small and medium-sized contractors, retailers and private homeowners.

<<<

 However, these customers are accessed through dealers with whom building
111

materials manufacturers have direct contractual relationships. Dealers can come in the form of wholesale builders' merchant distribution outlets aimed mainly at

<<<

 professionals, including bigger multinationals (such as Wolseley (i.e., DT Group, including Beijer, Stark and Starkki), Optimera and Rautakesko) as well as big local entities (such as Interpares and Maxbo). Alternatively, dealers can come in

<<<

 the form of retail outlets focused more on private end-customer DIY markets, such as Byggmax, Hornbach and Bauhaus. Dealers generally perform several functions. With respect to logistics and warehousing, they are responsible for managing inventories

<<<

 in various product categories and specific product ranges and shipping products from their warehouses or the manufacturers' warehouses to construction sites. Dealers also provide display areas for building materials products and provide advice

<<<

 and technical assistance to their customers. In addition, dealers invoice their end customers and thereby extend credit through payment terms and assume the risk of their customers' default. Physical deliveries to end customers are often made

<<<

 directly from building materials manufacturers to construction sites, without building materials physically going through builders merchants' warehouses. Under these circumstances, the function of dealers is often reduced to invoicing their

<<<

 end customers. The degree of involvement of dealers into sales processes varies by region, manufacturer and product. In direct sales activities the principal customer targets are national and regional construction companies, housing developers

<<<

, contractors and large industrial customers. These customers generally purchase significant volumes for use in major projects (such as large housing developments) and are focused on cost-effective product solutions, a steady supply chain and

<<<

 reliable service from insulation suppliers. To target market participants successfully, a business must demonstrate to potential customers that it is a reliable and efficient contracting partner (usually through a wide product range, high product

<<<

 quality, a reliable and accurate delivery service, comprehensive technical and product support and strong branding), and convey this message to the key decision makers for the ultimate customer (such as the architects and developers that influence

<<<

 bid invitations and specify building material types). The graph below shows the typical relationships between manufacturers of insulation, builders merchants, customers and various groups of decision makers in mature markets (dotted lines indicating

<<<

 relationships between parties other than with manufacturers). Additionally, direct deliveries occur to original equipment manufacturers such as producers of pre-fabricated wall-building elements, producers of pre-fabricated houses and construction

<<<

 sites with special logistical requirements.
Distribution of Building Material Products in Mature Markets
Create demand and influence supplier decisions through pre-sales
Supply The European mineral wool market is characterized by a small number

<<<

 of large pan-European manufacturers who account for the majority of the market. Among the suppliers of mineral wool in Europe, Rockwool, Saint Gobain, Uralita, Knauf and TechnoNICOL are our main competitors. Rockwool
112

is a global producer

<<<

 of stone wool headquartered in Copenhagen. Saint Gobain is a large diversified building materials group which markets its mineral wool products under the Isover brand; it is the largest glass wool producer and manufactures some stone wool.

<<<

 Uralita markets its products under the URSA brand and focuses on the manufacture of glass wool and XPS. Knauf is a German producer of mineral wool, foam and gypsum board with production sites in the US, Europe and Russia. TechnoNICOL is a Russian

<<<

-based producer and distributor of building materials, including thermal insulation, but also roofing/waterproofing materials, mastics and primers, flexible tiles and sealant tape. It produces both stone wool and extruded polystyrene foam insulation

<<<

 with a focus on Eastern European markets. The mineral wool market is dominated by branded products from the main producers.
In contrast, the foam-based insulation market is dominated by a few large chemical players such as Dow Chemicals and

<<<

 BASF, as well as Kingspan. It is highly fragmented beyond that with many small providers.
Generally, competition in the insulation industry is geographically limited, as transportation cost constitutes a significant part of overall product

<<<

 cost. Moreover, the requirements of local end-users in terms of standard specifications and other technical features for building materials may differ by geographic market, resulting in additional barriers to entry for non-regional suppliers

<<<

. However, imports of insulation materials play a growing role given harmonization of building regulations in Europe, such as under the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive adopted in May 2010 and the Energy Efficiency Directive due for

<<<

 implementation at member-state level in June 2014. Due to the high cost associated with transportation over long distances, the ability to maintain a dense network of production plants that serve local markets tends to give such companies a

<<<

 competitive advantage.
The production of stone wool requires a large initial capital investment. Capacity utilization rate for each plant is a competitive factor. Relatively lower levels of demand in the past 2-3 years, along with the high

<<<

 level of capital investment initially required to establish operations, have resulted in a limited number of new competitors entering our core markets. Raw materials for manufacturing stone wool insulation materials are generally available

<<<

 in all our markets, although the quality of economically obtainable raw materials does vary between regions. Typically, plants are located in close proximity to suitable raw material supplies and demand for products, thus naturally limiting

<<<

 the number of available first-class locations. An important component of cost is energy, which results in dependency on energy prices, in particular coke and electricity.
Key Industry Trends
In addition to a potential cyclical recovery in the

<<<

 residential, commercial and industrial construction sectors, the insulation industry is influenced by the following key trends:
Sustainability and Energy Efficiency Regulation
In light of high and increasing energy prices and commitments to

<<<

 reduce carbon dioxide emissions, governments, the construction industry and building owners are increasingly focusing on the modernization of existing buildings and improving the energy efficiency of new buildings. To that end, the reduction

<<<

 of energy consumption and elimination of unnecessary emissions from buildings are among the main objectives of the EPBD, which requires Member States to amend existing building regulations and to introduce energy certification schemes for buildings

<<<

, and the EED, which requires Member States to introduce national energy efficiency obligation schemes or other policy measures generative of equivalent energy savings. The EPBD has defined clear requirements relating to energy efficiency of

<<<

 new buildings from 2019 (public sector) and 2021 (private sector) onwards. Following the relevant implementation date, all new buildings must be "nearly zero energy buildings.'' In addition, the EED requires (subject to certain exceptions)

<<<

 that 3% of the total floor area of public buildings owned by central governments must be renovated to meet the energy efficiency requirement. Under the EPBD and enacting legislation at the Member State level, building materials producers will

<<<

 be under pressure to further develop and improve their products so that they meet regulatory requirements in terms of thermal insulation, carbon dioxide emissions and reduction of waste. In particular, of all available technologies, insulation

<<<

 offers one of the most cost-effective methods to reduce carbon dioxide emissions of all available technologies. Buildings make up approximately 40% of the energy consumption in the EU, with heating representing the majority of this energy consumption

<<<

, and, although significant developments have been made, further improvements are required to meet targets. Building heat loss through walls, roofs and floors can be reduced through improvements in insulation. In particular, stone wool offers

<<<

 high thermal insulation, fire protection and ease of handling, along with acoustic properties as required. We expect that in certain
113

segments of building construction, stone wool may have an advantage over other forms of insulation, such

<<<

 as glass wool or foam-based insulation, due to its fire safety properties. However these competing products are also being improved or developed to meet evolving requirements.
Demographic Trends, Higher Quality Construction and Renovation Activities

<<<


In light of expected future economic developments and demographic trends, many European countries rely on immigration of skilled workers, which may stimulate demand for new residential construction. At the same time, the number of households

<<<

 is increasing, primarily attributed to a trend towards a lower average number of persons per household, particularly in Western European countries. In order to facilitate and expedite construction activities and economize on operating cost

<<<

 of buildings, flexible building material solutions that combine ease of handling, pre-fabricated elements and superior product properties are expected to play an increasing role. Similarly, many Central and Eastern European countries, as a

<<<

 result of historical substantial underinvestment in the existing housing stock still require considerable new construction, as well as renovation and modernization, to meet the higher building standards prevailing in Western European countries

<<<

. Future GDP growth in many Central and Eastern European countries may therefore have a positive impact on demand and the evolution of new construction, as well as renovation and modernization activities.
Technical Insulation Industry
Market

<<<

 Size and Growth
Compared to the market for building insulation, the market for technical insulation is focused on industrial production and construction end-market drivers, with applications in the HVAC, Process Industries, Marine and OEM segments

<<<

. The main products used in technical insulation are pipe sections, wired net mats, lamella mats, on-line products and other tailored products.
The market for technical insulation varies depending on the application. Development in the HVAC

<<<

 segment, similar to the market for building insulation, is closely linked to the overall level of construction activity. Likewise, the OEM segment is driven by general construction activity along with an increased share of prefabrication in

<<<

 construction. The Process Industries and Marine segments are influenced primarily by the overall levels of capital investment expenditure in: (i) oil & gas, petrochemicals, power generation and other manufacturing industries; and (ii) shipbuilding

<<<

 and offshore construction activity, respectively.
Market Structure
Demand
The specifications and demand for technical insulation vary depending on application, with material choice by application being relatively consistent across different

<<<

 geographies. Mineral wool technical insulation tends to be the primary material of choice in Process Industry, Marine and OEM applications due to fire safety and temperature requirements. In the HVAC segment, mineral wool is preferred in sub

<<<

-segments where fire safety is necessary and where energy efficiency gains can be achieved, such as warm pipes, thermal insulated ducts, fire insulated ducts, sound insulated ducts, ventilation equipment, HVAC equipment and smoke & exhaust pipes

<<<

. Foams tend to be preferred in applications where moisture resistance is important. However, there is relatively limited direct substitutability as mineral wool and foam technical insulation products rarely compete directly for the same end

<<<

-use application.
Distribution
Distribution of technical insulation products is similar to the distribution of building insulation products. Technical insulation products are mainly distributed through HVAC material dealers and technical insulation

<<<

 dealers who provide service, quality, availability and sales support. The functions of the HVAC material dealers and technical insulation dealers are similar to those in the building materials industry.
Supply
The mineral wool technical insulation

<<<

 market is consolidated. The leading European technical insulation manufacturers (for all insulation materials, not just mineral wool) are Rockwool, Saint Gobain (marketed under the Isover brand) and Knauf. Unlike building insulation, the markets

<<<

 for technical insulation are broader in geographical scope, due to the higher transportable distances of technical insulation products,
114

resulting from the relatively less bulky nature of the products. As a result, the supplier structure

<<<

 for mineral wool technical insulation products is less fragmented and competition is less regional in nature than in the building insulation industry.
Key Industry Trends
Energy Efficiency Trends
Similar to the trends in the building insulation

<<<

 industry, within the industrial production and construction end-markets there are strong regulatory incentives to improve energy efficiency with EU directives aiming to reduce energy consumption through the EU 2020 targets and potentially further

<<<

 through the EU 2030 targets which are currently under review. Furthermore rising energy costs have also created strong economic incentives to increase efficiency, along with rising costs for carbon dioxide emissions. As in the case of building

<<<

 insulation, technical insulation is one of the most cost-effective ways to improve energy efficiency in industrial production and construction. Technical insulation is typically not regulated by law, with the obvious exception of fire protection

<<<

 requirements in ventilation systems (which is typically strictly regulated). Therefore technical insulation requirements are generally driven by industry standards and norms governed by industry bodies and associations, along with certification

<<<

 requirements and required product approvals. The ongoing trend towards stronger demand for energy efficient solutions and higher standards of fire protection are likely to result in higher demand for technical insulation.
Industrial Investment

<<<

 Trends
Economic growth will likely result in increased demand for technical insulation in key segments as investment into infrastructure and construction increases. Unlike new construction, renovation, remodeling and modernization activities

<<<

 in both industrial and marine applications have historically been less susceptible to cyclicality than new construction.
Sandwich Panels Industry
Market Size and Growth
The market for panels is primarily focused on commercial construction,

<<<

 and also industrial and storage applications. The main panel systems products include interior and external wall facades with various surface configurations, which are used in facade, fire, hygiene, acoustic and security systems. Many of these

<<<

 systems are tailor-made solutions to meet specific demands. Panel systems products are generally metal panels lined with insulation, and are used mainly as the wall elements of commercial and industrial buildings. The type of insulation used

<<<

 in the panels varies across markets, with alternatives to stone wool, including glass wool and foams such as PUR and PIR; however, the material used depends largely on cost, traditional usage and regulatory/fire safety requirements.
Market

<<<

 Structure
Demand
The specifications and demand for panel systems vary depending on application and customer requirements. Panels are generally produced and sold to order on a project basis, so key customers fluctuate from year to year. Panels

<<<

 are sold directly to installers and contractors, both primary and specialist. Demand can also be driven from specifications made during the design phase, such as by architects. This is because panels can be used for a number of different applications

<<<

 and speed up the build time, while at the same time reducing overall costs.
Supply
The panel systems market is consolidated in local markets, with the top players holding high local market shares. There are four key competitor types, including

<<<

 forward integrated steel players, such as SSAB/ Ruukki, prefabrication players, such as Kingspan, steel product manufacturers, such as Lindab, and forward integrated insulation players, such as Paroc. Differentiation is made through service

<<<

, design and quality control, with insulation materials players experiencing some cost advantages due to reduced transportation costs due to vertical integration.
115

Key Industry Trends Fire Safety Trends In addition to the energy efficiency

<<<

 trends seen in the building insulation industry, the increasing importance of and demand for data centers may result in increased demand for fire-safe solutions in the construction of new commercial buildings. Higher standards of fire protection

<<<

 and demands for energy efficient solutions may result in higher demand for mineral wool-based panel systems. Russian Insulation Industry Market Size and Growth Building insulation uses (requiring insulation slabs, mats and sandwich panels)

<<<

 comprise the majority of the overall Russian market for mineral wool insulation, with technical insulation representing a relatively smaller proportion of the market at present. Within the mineral wool market, stone wool has become established

<<<

 as the most important material, and is used in Russia far more widely compared with glass wool products. The development of the Russian insulation market is closely linked to the level of construction activity, which in turn is linked to growth

<<<

 of the broader economy. Commercial construction is driven by the significant need to develop high-quality infrastructure in Russia, and is currently underpinned by certain major projects in the medium term (e.g., FIFA World Cup in 2018). These

<<<

 incentives include dedicated renovation fees payable by owners of apartments, with proceeds earmarked for renovation activities. Market Structure Demand and supply dynamics in Russia are broadly in line with the dynamics in more mature markets

<<<

 for mineral wool insulation products. At present, the vast majority of the demand for insulation in Russia is concentrated around building insulation uses (approximately 90% of the market size in 2012), with stone wool as the preferred material

<<<

 of choice. Given the relatively fragmented nature of the Russian market, dealers (primarily insulation wholesalers, as well as DIY stores) are the most important distribution channel of insulation products in Russia. Supply in the Russian market

<<<

 is also relatively fragmented, with the vast majority of Russian sales of insulation products supplied nationally, partially due to significant import tariffs.

Key Industry Trends
Increasing legal/regulatory push for increased energy

<<<

 efficiency Russia has historically been one of the most energy intensive countries in the world. This is partly due to the relatively low energy efficiency of the existing building stock, as well as climactic and intrinsic economic factors

<<<

 (with a significant part of its industrial sector consisting of energy-heavy industries). The U.S. Energy Information Administration ("EIA") determined in 2011 that for every USD1,000 of GDP produced, Russia consumed 1.25 tonnes coal equivalent

<<<

 ("tce") of primary energy, substantially above several other developed and developing economies (Finland 0.21 tce).

As a result, energy efficiency has been identified as a key priority of the Russian Ministry of Energy and the Federal Law on Energy Conservation and Increase of Energy Efficiency was

<<<

 adopted in Russia in November 2009, creating a legal and economic framework to encourage energy efficiency by setting standards for policy enforcement. Its primary focus is around the energy efficiency of buildings, and it introduces mandatory

<<<

 requirements for the installation of energy consumption meters, as well as stricter requirements for monitoring and information provision.
Differentiated pricing dynamics with resilient pricing in the premium segment
In recent years, certain

<<<

 sub-segments of the Russian insulation market have experienced some, albeit limited, pricing pressure. This has been focused on the lower-quality, lower price segment of the market. Pricing in premium products, such as our products, remained

<<<

 far more resilient with much smaller or negligible declines in pricing between 2011 and 2013.
We expect the current trends of increasing focus on fire safety, improvements in construction quality and the quality of building practices in Russia

<<<

, particularly in the Central and North Western Federal regions, to provide a stronger impetus to the growth in the high-quality segment of the market, which has been the strongest-growth segment in recent years. Consequently, we expect to see

<<<

 a continued resilience in the pricing of the premium segment in the Russian insulation market, due to the strong demand in this segment.

BUSINESS
Overview
We are a producer of premium stone wool insulation, and we believe that we are

<<<

 a market leader in Finland, Sweden and the Baltic States by market share, which according to our estimates has remained stable overall over the past three years. Our other important markets include Norway, Denmark, Poland, Germany and the United

<<<

 Kingdom. Our stone wool products are used for both building insulation and technical insulation, and are known for their high product quality and superior fire resistance, as evidenced by customer and market surveys. We have significantly broadened

<<<

 our geographic sales reach since 2009 through the expansion and leveraging of our strategically located manufacturing network, allowing for an increasing sales presence in western Europe and Russia, which we view to be potential growth markets

<<<

. As of March 31, 2014, we operated nine production plants in five different countries with 13 Base production lines, 18 Technical Insulation production lines and one Panel System production line. As of the same date, we also had sales and representative

<<<

 offices in 14 European countries and sales to over 40 countries. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we generated total sales of 433.1 million (with Finland, Sweden and the Baltic States accounting for 20.2%, 25.1% and 8.6% of our total sales

<<<

, respectively) and Adjusted EBITDA of 82.8 million.
Our business is organized in four divisions:
 Building Insulation ("BI"). Our Building Insulation division markets and distributes a range of insulation productions and solutions for residential

<<<

 and commercial buildings in both new-build and renovation construction markets. Products in the BI division range from general building insulation to more specialized acoustic or fire protection insulation products. General building insulation

<<<

 is the largest business segment within BI. The majority of the BI division's stone wool products are manufactured by our Base Production division, with the exception of some more specialized acoustics and roofing products, which are produced

<<<

 by our Technical Insulation division. The BI division does not have its own production lines or manufacturing capacity. The BI division also sells panel wool internally to our Panel System division and sells insulation for pre-fabricated panels

<<<

 to third parties across Europe. For the year ended December 31, 2013, our Building Insulation division generated sales of 256.7 million (with external sales of 242.0 million, or 55.9% of our total sales).
 Technical Insulation ("TI"). Our

<<<

 Technical Insulation division produces high-quality stone wool products used in specialized industrial and technical applications. Because the TI division's products are tailored for specific customer applications, including meeting regulatory

<<<

 requirements, the TI division has its own manufacturing capacity. It uses stone wool from the Base Production division to produce more customized TI products through its own production lines and specialized machinery. There are 18 TI production

<<<

 lines at four plants. Products in the TI division are primarily used to provide insulation from heat, fire, condensation and sound, and are supplied to four key end-markets: heating, ventilation and air conditioning ("HV4C"), process industries

<<<

, marine and offshore and original equipment manufacturers (``OEM"). The TI division also sells specialized acoustics and roofing products to the BI division. For the year ended December 31, 2013, our Technical Insulation division generated

<<<

 sales of 150.9 million (with external sales of 133.5 million, or 30.8% of our total sales).
 Panel System ("PPS"). Our Panel System division manufactures sandwich facade panels--lightweight steel-faced panels with an insulating core of stone

<<<

 wool. The main application of these panels are in the industrial and commercial construction of warehouses, municipal buildings and offices. The PPS division buys its stone wool from the BI division. For the year ended December 31, 2013, our

<<<

 Panel System division generated sales of 56.2 million (with external sales of 56.2 million, or 13.0% of our total sales).
 Base Production ("Base"). Our Base Production division is responsible for producing all of the stone wool for our BI

<<<

, TI and PPS divisions, developing proprietary production technology and managing capacity utilization across the Paroc Group. As of March 31, 2014, we operated eight production plants in five different countries with 13 Base production lines

<<<

 producing stone wool. Production sites are managed as a network, with production costs allocated to the most cost-efficient plant, taking into account distribution costs. For the year ended December 31, 2013, our Base division generated sales

<<<

 of 207.8 million (including internal sales of 207.3 million and external sales of 0.5 million). All of our internal sales are at a fixed cost agreed at the beginning of each year.

History
Our business has its origin in 1937, when a local

<<<

 manufacturer began manufacturing stone wool in Sweden. Stone wool manufacturing began in Finland in 1952, the same year Partek, a Finnish industrial conglomerate, first commenced insulation production. We were formed under Partek and in 19

<<<

82, Paroc's name and trademark were registered for the first time and our Finnish and Swedish operations begin to operate under one group. In 1999, Paroc was carved out from Partek after a 60% interest in Paroc was acquired by Industri Kapital

<<<

 and the company name changed to "Paroc." In 2003, Paroc was acquired by Banc of America Capital Partners Europe and Accent Equity and, in 2006, Paroc was acquired by Arcapita Bank B.S.C. In 2009, after a restructuring of our debt facilities

<<<

, a lender consortium took control of Paroc, with management taking an ownership stake in the Group. See ``Principal Shareholders
Our Strengths
We believe the following strengths have contributed to our success historically and are key factors

<<<

 in our efforts to deliver profitable future growth:
Market-leading positions in our home markets, underpinned by strength of brand and reputation for high product and service quality
We believe that we are a market leader based on market share

<<<

 in our home markets of Finland, Sweden and the Baltic States in both stone wool building insulation and stone wool technical insulation. We seek to differentiate ourselves from our competitors through our portfolio of high-quality stone wool

<<<

 products offered under our distinctive, widely recognized brand, together with our ability to provide innovative, customer-specific solutions through our full-service sales and technical support offering. Over our 75 years of operations, we

<<<

 have built strong, often long-term customer relationships, particularly with dealers (which comprise insulation wholesalers as well as DIY stores) in our home markets, which are the primary distribution channel for our building and technical

<<<

 insulation products. We believe that the superior quality of our products and services has reinforced the strength of our brand and resulted in a high degree of customer loyalty and retention.
Increasingly diversified business across geographies

<<<

, end-markets and product mix
We sell our products through multiple sales channels in over 40 countries to various end-markets, which we believe reduces our dependency on any single market and positions us to capture additional opportunities

<<<

 to expand our business. Our largest markets are Finland and Sweden, which represented 20% and 25%, respectively, of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013, and no other country represented more than 10% of our revenues for the year

<<<

 ended December 31, 2013. We have strong relationships with our customers and have multiple sales channels including dealers, construction contractors, industrial companies and equipment manufacturers (for example, prefabricated house and panel

<<<

 manufacturers, and specialist original equipment manufacturers).
We have also diversified our end-market footprint and product mix in recent years with the growth of our TI division, which now represents a significant part of our business,

<<<

 having reached external revenues of 133.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Our TI division displays a greater resilience and higher gross profit margins than our other divisions. This is primarily due to the fact that we sell our

<<<

 TI products to a more diversified set of end markets across Europe, as well as the higher value-added nature of our TI products, which typically require a greater degree of customization and additional manufacturing refinements to meet more

<<<

 specialized applications. Although our TI division relies to some extent on the residential and commercial construction sectors (primarily for the sale of HVAC products), we also supply our various TI products to diverse end markets, such as

<<<

 the oil and gas, petrochemical, power generation, pulp and paper, marine and offshore and OEM industries.
Given the growth of our TI business and the associated higher margins and broader set of end-market drivers compared to our other construction

<<<

-focused divisions, we believe that the Group today has a more robust, resilient financial profile than in the past.
Established position through well-invested manufacturing base, branded products and strong customer relationships
We have a

<<<

 broad manufacturing base, consisting of nine production facilities in five countries. Our network of plants, located in Finland, Sweden, Lithuania, Poland and Russia, provides a stable platform to enable
119

us to meet our high quality standards

<<<

 consistently across our markets and to supply products to our customers on a localized and cost-efficient basis, reducing transport costs, delivery times and import tariffs. Our proprietary technology, including our proprietary recipe and manufacturing

<<<

 process for the production of our stone wool products, also supports the manufacture of our high-specification products. This allows us to produce a high-quality, differentiated product with strong brand value and corresponding pricing. We

<<<

 have made significant investments to develop, and to continuously improve our facilities, as well as our product specifications and our manufacturing processes and technologies. We review our operations on an ongoing basis to ensure that our

<<<

 stone wool products meet the strict safety, environmental and efficacy standards in the markets in which we operate. We believe it would take considerable time and substantial investment to replicate our manufacturing base and product portfolio

<<<

 due to the proprietary technology, high levels of capital expenditure, regulatory requirements, maintenance costs, complex supply chain and strict quality standards needed to operate in the stone wool market.
We also benefit from the partial

<<<

 vertical integration of our supply chain and, for the year ended December 31, 2013, were able to supply approximately 30% of our raw stone needs through our ownership of rights or concessions to quarry stone from eight quarries in Finland.

<<<

 As a result, we have the ability to supply a majority of our requirements of certain stones that are difficult to source from third parties internally, leading to lower raw materials input costs (through a reduction in transportation logistics

<<<

 costs), assuring the quality of our stone wool products, and reducing our dependence on third-party suppliers.
In addition, we have strong, and often longstanding, customer relationships, as well as the brand awareness amongst dealers and contractors

<<<

. Based on a recent customer differentiation survey conducted by BrandWorxx in 2013, over 90% of customers surveyed view Paroc as their preferred partner relative to competitors. The survey also highlighted Paroc as efficient, reliable and innovative

<<<

, as well as the most socially responsible provider. We believe that this brand recognition translates into strong customer loyalty.
Attractive financial profile with strong cash generation and flexible cost base
We have a strong financial track

<<<

 record with net sales of 404.8 million, 430.4 million and 433.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 3.4%. We have also demonstrated an ability to improve Adjusted

<<<

 EBITDA during periods of macroeconomic volatility, with Adjusted EBITDA of 61.2 million, 75.1 million and 82.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 15.8%.
While

<<<

 we have made significant strategic growth investment capital expenditures in each of the last three years (particularly in Russia), our maintenance capital expenditure requirements are relatively low and manageable, with expenditures of 15

<<<

.8 million, 10.3 million and 10.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively. This attractive capex profile, in combination with our continued focus on working capital optimization, has translated into a consistently

<<<

 positive cash conversion over the past three fiscal years.
We also have a flexible cost base with an ability to effectively increase and decrease the number of employees and number of shifts at our manufacturing plants depending on customer

<<<

 demand levels. For the year ended December 31, 2013, approximately 83% of our cost of sales was variable, comprising, among other things, raw materials cost, energy cost, direct production wages and distribution cost, which generally move in

<<<

-line with changes in volume. Furthermore, our well-invested manufacturing platform and ability to increase capacity utilization provides operating leverage to drive potential profitability when volumes increase.
Growth profile is well supported

<<<

 by insulation trends and favorable regulatory dynamics
We believe that our markets stand to benefit from a favorable regulatory environment in the medium-term, driven by a Europe-wide governmental commitment to improve energy efficiency standards

<<<

 and reduce energy consumption and costs, which should lead to an increase in the intensity of insulation use. In recent years there has been an increased political focus throughout the European Union on climate change, which, in combination

<<<

 with rising energy costs, has resulted in the implementation of tighter regulations concerning energy efficiency both at the EU and the individual country level. Current EU directives, for example, impose energy efficiency requirements on new

<<<

 and renovated buildings in connection with a targeted 20% reduction in energy consumption by 2020. Given that insulation can dramatically reduce heat loss and energy consumption in buildings and also has the added benefit of being one of the

<<<

 most
120

cost-effective of all the available technologies to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, the implementation of more stringent energy efficiency requirements has affected demand for our products in our various geographic markets.
At the

<<<

 national level, individual countries put in place their own specific requirements from time to time that can drive market demand for insulation products. While the Nordic region has traditionally had relatively more comprehensive energy efficiency

<<<

 measures in place than our other focus markets, continued tightening of certain specific regulations (for example, the recent implementation in Finland and Sweden of new regulations requiring greater thicknesses for technical insulation) has

<<<

 recently fuelled demand for the higher margin, more specialized products offered by our Technical Insulation division. In addition, increased fire safety regulations in many of our markets (particularly in central Europe) in recent years has

<<<

 increased demand for our stone wool products, which are known for their superior fire resistance qualities compared with other insulation materials, particularly foam insulation.
Highly experienced and committed management team
Our experienced

<<<

 and committed management team led by Kari Lehtinen, our Chief Executive Officer, and Anders Dahlblom, our Chief Financial Officer, is a key factor in the continuing success of our business. Our management team has a strong background in manufacturing

<<<

 businesses, with an average of approximately 18 years of industry experience. Our management team has implemented a comprehensive business plan that we believe will allow us to protect our market share in our home markets and capture growth

<<<

 in our other focus markets. In addition, our management team includes a strong senior management team, with the division heads representing a combined total of 89 years' industry experience, with 61 years at Paroc Group.
Our Strategy
We believe

<<<

 we have a strong business platform across our established divisions. We will continue to leverage our strengths and drive improvements based on the following key strategies:
Maintain existing presence and grow market share in home markets,

<<<

 with continued innovation and expansion of our product and solution offering
In our home markets of Finland, Sweden and the Baltic States, our key priority is to maintain and protect our existing market leadership positions through a continuing

<<<

 commitment to innovation, in particular through the creation and development of what we believe to be superior, premium insulation products.
We are highly motivated to improve and develop our product and service offering, as we pursue innovation

<<<

 through research and development projects. In our BI division, we intend to strengthen our product offering in the renovation and low lambda segments (where "lambda'' is a measure of the insulating capacity of a product for a given thickness

<<<

, with lower values indicating a better insulating capacity). The renovation sector is attractive as it tends to be less vulnerable to market cyclicalities than the new build construction sector, and lower lambda products are appealing to customers

<<<

 because they provide the same level of insulation with a thinner insulation layer or provide a higher level of insulation with the same insulation thickness. In our TI division, we intend to focus on the development of new HVAC solutions, as

<<<

 well as oil & gas and marine product certifications, since product certifications are vital to our key TI end-market customers. Externally, we are focused on enhancing our existing products and developing new products to meet our customers

<<<

' known and anticipated needs. Internally, we are focused on innovation across the organization, including integrating new technologies and adopting new methods of working with our customers. We also intend to strengthen our dealer network to

<<<

 set ourselves apart as the supplier of choice in our other focus markets. In our PPS division, we intend to focus on value-add services to our products, utilizing our skilled staff to develop tailored solutions for our customers' projects,

<<<

 ensure smooth implementation of those projects and provide technical advice on the design and selection of structural solutions.
Grow our market share in other focus markets with existing proven products
In our BI division, our strategic priority

<<<

 is to secure a recognized market position, which we aim to achieve by growing faster than the underlying construction market with modest share gains, driven by strong brand positioning and an active sales strategy of dealer and contractor targeting

<<<

.
121

In our TI division, our strategy is to strengthen our market positioning and grow market share in certain core end-markets, by leveraging our state-of-the-art technical insulation manufacturing capability at our Trzemeszno facility.

<<<

 This growth is expected to be led by our HVAC offering, and strengthening our dealer network will be highly important to achieving these strategic objectives. Outside of Europe, where we sell technical insulation on a project basis, we intend

<<<

 to take a highly selective and opportunistic approach to project sales, with a focus on larger-scale industrial projects with higher value-added products. In our PPS division, our strategy is to emphasize our panels' design and aesthetics,

<<<

 and the fact that our product offering includes the materials needed to complete a panel wall structure. Focus on the growth potential in Russia and capitalize on our in-country manufacturing presence Our recent investment in our new Tver manufacturing

<<<

 facility in Russia, which began meaningful commercial production in January 2014, has provided us with an in-country manufacturing presence and will enable us to serve the growing Russian market. Although we had previously sold our products

<<<

 in Russia through sales offices, developing an in-country manufacturing presence has reduced the transportation costs required to serve the market and has allowed us to avoid the significant tariffs on our imported products, which had previously

<<<

 limited the profitability of our Russian sales. We intend to use the quality of our product offering and our brand strength to modestly grow market share. We anticipate that demand in the Russian market will support our new Tver manufacturing

<<<

 facility operating at high capacity utilization from the second year of its operation. Although no decision has yet been made, detailed plans are being considered for the addition of a second production line in Tver for the manufacture of base

<<<

 stone wool, as well as the addition of new machinery that would provide us with off line TI production capacity, which would double base production capacity in Russia and allow us to take advantage of growing Russian demand for technical insulation

<<<

 solutions. Drive further efficiency and cost savings through operational excellence We plan to improve efficiency and cost savings through a continued focus on research and development. We have implemented our ``Operational Excellence'' plan

<<<

, which is a clear and detailed cost savings program through which we have delivered, and believe we will continue to deliver, significant savings. We anticipate that these savings will primarily come from our Base Production division, with

<<<

 one of the key sources of cost reduction expected to be energy efficiency measures applied throughout the production process. Through these initiatives, we believe we can manage our cost base more effectively and generate margin enhancement

<<<

 through operational leverage if we increase production over the medium term.
122

Divisions
We manufacture and sell a range of stone wool products for residential, commercial and industrial new build construction, renovation, remodeling and

<<<

 modernization projects. We have divided our business into four divisions: (1) Building Insulation division, (2) Technical Insulation division, (3) Panel System division and (4) Base Production division, which correspond to our new segment structure

Base Production
Our Base Production division is responsible for producing all of the stone wool for our Building Insulation and Technical Insulation divisions, developing proprietary

<<<

 production technology and stone wool properties and managing capacity utilization (including warehousing and deliveries) across the Paroc Group. As of March 31, 2014, we operated eight production plants in five different countries with 13 Base

<<<

 Production lines producing stone wool. Production sites are managed as a network with production costs allocated to the most cost-efficient plant, taking into account distribution costs. All of our internal sales to other divisions are at a

<<<

 fixed cost agreed at the beginning of each year.

Raw materials
The main raw materials for the production of stone wool are stone raw materials, coke, binding agents, coatings and adhesives and steel (for sandwich panels only). The purchase

<<<

 of the majority of key raw materials is undertaken centrally, and in recent years we have diversified our sourcing to reduce over reliance on a small number of suppliers.

123

Stone and quarries
The quality of stone used in the production

<<<

 process is critical to the quality of the wool produced. We try to source our stone as locally as possible to our production facilities due to high transportation costs, although certain types of stone are transported from Finland to some of

<<<

 our plants. The stones we transport from our quarries in Finland are important to our production processes due to their unique chemical composition and the fact that they are more difficult to source from third parties.
We currently hold eight

<<<

 mining districts (i.e., mining concessions) in Finland: Joutsenenlampi, Lehlampi, Ybbersnas, Sallittu, Vanhasuo, Metsasianniemi, Natramala and Kangas. We own the two real property sites included in the Joutsenenlampi mining district, pay a

<<<

 leasing fee for the land on which the Sallittu and the Kangas districts are located, and for the other five quarries, we do not lease the land, but pay the statutory mining excavation fee. We do not currently conduct quarrying activities at

<<<

 the Kangas and Natramala mining districts and hold these sites as reserve sites. After the closure of our Lappeenranta facility, we will likely also hold the Vanhasuo mining district as a reserve site. Our quarries are ISO 9001 and 14001 certified

<<<

, and operations in our quarries are conducted by third parties.
For the year ended December 31, 2013, we supplied approximately 30% of the total raw stone material that our operations required from quarries over which we have mining rights

<<<

. We acquired the balance of our stone requirements from third parties. Certain of the stones we require for our production processes are more difficult to source from third parties, and we have the ability to source these stones from quarries

<<<

 over which we have mining rights for the medium- to long-term. We have applied for mining district decisions at the Teerisuo and Longanlampi quarries, which, when granted, will increase our reserves of these stones that are more difficult to

<<<

 source from third parties. For information on the permitting process, see "Risk Factors--Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry-- Our licenses, permits and certifications may be suspended, amended or terminated prior to the end of their

<<<

 terms or may not be renewed" and "Regulation."
If necessary, we have a substitute supplier of one type of stone that is more difficult to source from third parties, which we use instead of our own stone when it is cost effective to do so. We

<<<

 can substitute slag (non-virgin material, which is a residual product from other industrial processes, for example, steel making) for another type of less readily available stone, but this is not easily available, as we can only use slag of

<<<

 suitable chemical composition. Slag is currently used in our Polish operations, and we are considering the expansion of slag usage to other production sites. The main driver in the use of slag is cost, specifically logistics costs. We estimate

<<<

 that it would cost approximately 50,000 per plant in research and development and other costs implement the use of slag instead of this virgin stone across all our production facilities. This estimated cost does not include possible losses

<<<

 in productivity or higher scrapping costs. See "Risk Factors--Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry-- The quality of our stone wool products depends upon our ability to successfully exploit existing resources of stone raw materials

<<<

 that are difficult to source from third parties and acquire and develop further stone raw material resources at competitive costs. Delay or failure in acquiring, developing and completing development projects could have an adverse effect on

<<<

 our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows."
Other raw materials
The quality of coke (a fuel made from coking coal, a low-ash, low-sulfur bituminous coal) is also important, as variation in the quality and size

<<<

 of coke can materially impact the output of stone wool production. The furnaces used in this process are unique, and are calibrated over years to ensure optimal performance. We currently source the coke we use from a steel producer in Poland

<<<

 and other suppliers in Spain, Italy and Ukraine. Negotiated prices are generally based on trends in Australian coking coal prices. Although we use coke as our primary melting energy source, electricity is used on two lines and for general production

<<<

 needs. Because of the recent political instability in the Ukraine, we have put in place contingency plans to source our coke from the Czech Republic and Poland if the need arises. See "Risk Factors--Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry

<<<

-- Our business may be negatively affected by volatility in raw and other material prices, our inability to retain or replace our key suppliers, unexpected supply shortages and disruptions of the supply chain."
We use an industry standard phenol

<<<

-based binder. While such a binder is available from other suppliers, switching suppliers would require extensive testing. We are in the process of testing a new form of binder which would decrease emissions levels, however, we expect that this

<<<

 will increase costs. The pricing of the binder fluctuates annually, impacted primarily by changes in the component pricing for phenol, urea and methanol, in addition to any material change in the euro to US dollar exchange rate.
124

Production

<<<

 process
There are seven key processes to the manufacture of stone wool: raw material handling, melting, spinning, wool collection, curing, cutting and packaging.
Raw material handling involves measuring out the required quantities of stone

<<<

 and coke to use in the melting process. The raw materials are precisely blended to create the optimum melt for stone wool fiber production. In the melting process, the measured raw materials are then melted together in a cupola furnace or electric

<<<

 melting furnace, using the coke and electricity as the source of heat energy. In the spinning process, the now-melted raw materials are fed directly onto a spinner, which produces the fine stone wool fibers. A small amount of binding materials

<<<

 is then added. In the wool collection process, the fibers are then collected to form a thin sheet of raw stone wool, and then the sheets are layered and compressed to specified densities, depending on the product specifications. In the curing

<<<

 process, uncured stone wool for use in pipe machines within the Technical Insulation division is taken off of the production line (this stone wool is left uncured) and the remaining stone wool is reheated to cure and harden the resin binding

<<<

. In the sixth process, cured products to be sold by the Technical Insulation, Building Insulation or Panel System divisions are cut as according to product specifications, and in the final process, the products are packaged in the form of rolls

<<<

, pipes, slabs, panels or mats. We also produce ``blowing wool'' (granulated stone wool for thermal insulation) mainly from product waste.
Sales
The Base Production division sells its stone wool products to the Building Insulation and Technical

<<<

 Insulation divisions at a fixed cost agreed at the beginning of each year. The Panel System division and our Russian operations enter into fixed price agreements at the beginning of each year, establishing the price and volume at which the

<<<

 Base Production division will sell its stone wool production. We produced a volume of approximately 375.9 thousand tonnes, 377.2 thousand tonnes and 379.9 thousand tonnes of stone wool in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively

<<<

, and we had internal sales of 200.4 million, 207.4 million and 207.3 million in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively. Of the stone wool we produced in the year ended December 31, 2013, 27% was produced in Finland,

<<<

 24% in Sweden, 30% in Poland and 19% in Lithuania.
The Base Production division also has external income relating to royalty income from licensing agreements, and from the sale of unusable fragments of stone from the quarries over which we

<<<

 have quarrying rights. The division had external sales of 0.5 million, 0.4 million and 0.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively.
Building Insulation
Overview
Our Building Insulation division is the marketing

<<<

 and distribution operation for the stone wool insulation produced by our Base Production division for residential and non-residential buildings (for both new-build and renovation construction markets). The BI division does not have its own

<<<

 production lines or manufacturing capacity. BI sends its product orders to the Base Production division which manufacturers and delivers the product to the end customer. Products in the BI division range from general building insulation to

<<<

 more specialized acoustic or fire protection insulation products, with the majority marketed through the PAROC brand. General building insulation is the largest business segment within BI. The majority of the BI division's stone wool products

<<<

 are manufactured by our Base Production division, with the exception of some more specialized acoustics and roofing products, which are produced by our Technical Insulation division for our BI division. The BI division also sells panel stone

<<<

 wool internally to our PPS division and also sells insulation for pre-fabricated panels to third parties across Europe.
For the year ended December 31, 2013, our Building Insulation division generated sales of 256.7 million (with external sales

<<<

 of 242.0 million, or 55.9% of our total sales). Excluding sales to Russia, our Building Insulation division generated sales of 232.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2013, sales in our major markets

<<<

 in the BI division (excluding sales to Russia) were as follows: Finland (27%), Sweden (29%), the Baltic States (12%), Poland (7%), Germany, Austria and Switzerland (6%), Denmark (3%) and Norway (7%). We believe that by market share, we are

<<<

 the market leaders in both Sweden and the Baltic States (taken as a whole), among the top two in Finland and among the top three in Norway. For the year ended December 31, 2013, on a gross basis excluding sales to Russia, 47% of BI's sales

<<<

 were for new residential construction, 37% of BI's sales were for new non-residential construction and 16% of BI's sales were for renovation projects.
Product Offerings
We offer a wide product assortment of BI products in each of the following

<<<

 categories.
125

General building insulation
We manufacture a range of general insulation products designed for use in walls, roofs and flooring, including flexible slabs and mats (multi-purpose general thermal insulation), blowing wool (for

<<<

 lofts), wall insulation and boards (both semi-rigid and rigid) and wind protection slabs (tough, windproof panels with Tyvek special facing). General building insulation generated sales of 83 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, representing

<<<

 36% of BI's total sales (excluding sales to Russia).
Roof insulation
We manufacture slabs designed for thermal insulation as an underlayer and single layers for flat roofs, as well as boards used for top layer insulation, and are also now introducing

<<<

 roofing insulation. Roof insulation generated sales of 46 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, representing 20% of Bl's total sales (excluding sales to Russia).
Rendered facade insulation
Rendered facade products produce a seamless

<<<

 surface for external walls which does not accumulate moisture and does not react to changes in temperature. We produce slabs for mechanical fastening and insulated lamellas for fastening by adhesive mortar. Rendered facade insulation generated

<<<

 sales of 23 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, representing 10% of BI's total sales (excluding sales to Russia).
Panel insulation
We manufacture concrete panel slabs (core insulation material for manufactured concrete panels) and

<<<

 metal-faced panel slabs (rigid fireproof stone wool in slabs or cut into lamellas for metal faced sandwich panels) used in panels and sold to third parties as well as internally to our PPS division. Panel insulation generated sales of 44 million

<<<

 for the year ended December 31, 2013, representing 19% of Bl's total sales (excluding sales to Russia).
Fire protection
We manufacture special slabs and boards for fire protection applications. Paroc stone wool retains its properties at temperatures

<<<

 as high as 1000캜. We offer a variety of fire protection (including for steel structures, corrugated steel, chimneys, corridor linings, fire insulated ducts, among other applications) and fire partitioning solutions. Fire protection generated

<<<

 sales of 4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, representing 2% of Bl's total sales (excluding sales to Russia).
Acoustic products
We manufacture a wide range of acoustic tiles for suspended ceilings as well as for wall mounting in

<<<

 a number of applications under the PARAFON brand name. Our acoustic products are manufactured in Skovde, Sweden, and are designed to absorb sounds that might otherwise be reflected and create an unpleasant indoor environment. The absorption

<<<

 coefficient for stone wool is ~0.90-1.00 (frequencies above 500 Hz) which means that 90%-100% of the sound will be absorbed by the acoustic product. Acoustic products generated sales of 15 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, representing

<<<

 6% of BI's total sales (excluding sales to Russia).
Ground insulation
We manufacture special stone wool insulation for foundations and cellar walls. A major issue when designing foundations is "frost heave,'' which results from ice forming

<<<

 beneath the surface of the soil when there are freezing conditions in the atmosphere. Frost heave cracks foundations and can damage the entire structure of a building. Our ground insulation stone wool products are designed to stop frost heave

<<<

 and moisture problems. Ground insulation generated sales of 2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, representing 1% of Bl's total sales (excluding sales to Russia).
Customers and marketing
In the BI division, the main customer base

<<<

 is the building construction industry, which we reach through various distribution channels. The primary distribution channel is through dealers, accounting for 43% of total BI division sales (on a gross basis excluding sales to Russia) for

<<<

 the year ended December 31, 2013,
126

which encompasses wholesalers of insulation as well as DIY-type stores. The two other major customers groups are building contractors and construction companies (28% of total BI division sales (on a gross

<<<

 basis excluding sales to Russia) for the year ended December 31, 2013) (that, depending on their size, may buy direct from Paroc) and industrial customers, such as pre-fabricated house manufacturers and panel manufacturers, where insulation

<<<

 is a major component of their product (24% of total BI division sales (on a gross basis excluding sales to Russia) for the year ended December 31, 2013). Of total BI division sales (on a gross basis excluding Russia), 4% represented sales to

<<<

 other customers.
Our BI division marketing effort is focused on product positioning across geographies and on new product development through collaboration with the Base Production division and investment in R&D programs. We also focus on obtaining

<<<

 the requisite product approvals and certifications, following market trends and regulatory requirements, as well as lobbying with industry groups for better insulation requirements. We dedicate a considerable amount of time to educating and

<<<

 training staff in the uses and benefits of Paroc insulation. The main avenue for targeting customers is by way of direct interaction with key accounts, supported by brochures and internet services, and the occasional use of the media in local

<<<

 geographies.
Technical Insulation
Overview
Our Technical Insulation division produces high-quality stone wool products used in specialized industrial and technical applications. Because the TI division's products are tailored for specific customer

<<<

 applications, the TI division has its own manufacturing capacity, using stone wool produced by the Base Production division to produce the more customized TI products. Products in the TI division are primarily used to provide insulation from

<<<

 heat, fire, condensation and sound, including products designed to meet regulatory requirements. TI products are supplied to four key end-markets: HVAC, process industries, marine and offshore and OEM. The TI division also sells specialized

<<<

 acoustics and roofing products to the BI division. For the year ended December 31, 2013, our Technical Insulation division generated sales of 150.9 million (with external sales of 133.5 million, or 30.8% of our total sales). Geographically

<<<

, we estimate that by market share, we are the market leader in each of Finland and Sweden, among the top two in the market comprising the Baltic States, Poland, Ukraine, Belarus, Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic and Hungary, and among the

<<<

 top three in the market comprising Norway and Denmark.
Production process
Given the high-specialized nature of our TI products, the TI division has its own proprietary manufacturing capability to turn stone wool from the Base Production division

<<<

 into TI products, both the more standardized TI products (including pipe sections and wired mats) produced on the TI production lines and "special products'' (including OEM products and specialized HVAC products) produced with specialized machinery

<<<

 designed for "special product production." Base Production supplies intermediate stone wool products (raw, uncured wool and basic slabs and mats) to TI at full manufacturing cost. TI has its own operators and machines to manufacture our most

<<<

 customized products, and our TI manufacturing is closely configured with Base Production. We expect to have sufficient capacity to 2018, and there is the potential to increase pipe section production capability in 2019 if volumes grow strongly

<<<

 in the intervening period.
We make the following products in the TI division that have applications in our key end-markets: pipe sections (one of our key product lines), segments/bends, wired mats, lamella mats, slabs with facings, non-faced

<<<

 slabs, high temperature bricks (production was discontinued in February 2014) and OEM products. Pipe sections are made from raw, uncured wool from our Base Production division that is unrolled, cut to size, rolled and compressed to pipe, cured

<<<

 and packaged. Wire net mats are made from a mat of stone wool from our Base Production division that is cut to size and a wire net attached. Lamella mats are made from a slab of stone wool from our Base Production division that is cut, reoriented

<<<

 with a facing attached. The TI division also has R&D programs for its applications and products.
There are 18 TI production lines at four plants (Lappeenranta (4), of which two TI production lines will be shut down in 2014 with the remaining

<<<

 two TI production lines shut down in 2016 (see ``--Production facilities and inter-segment sales--Lappeenranta closure" for more information), Hallekis (2), Skovde (2) and Trzemeszno (10)), with special product production equipment at Hallekis

<<<

, Trzemeszno and Skovde.
127

Product offerings, key markets and customers
Given the higher value-added nature of TI's products, our TI division achieves higher margins than our BI division. In addition, the TI division is able to sell to a

<<<

 wider geographic area, given the lower margin dilution impact of transportation costs versus BI products. As a consequence, we are able to selectively supply TI products to high-value, high-margin products outside of our core European markets

<<<

.
Product offerings
We supply the following products in the TI division that have applications in our key end-markets: pipe sections (one of our key product lines), segments/bends, wired mats, lamella mats, slabs with facings, non-faced slabs

<<<

, preformed blocks and OEM products.
Key markets and customers
The key markets and customers of each of the four key end-markets are described below. For the year ended December 31, 2013, 43% of TI's external sales (on a gross basis, excluding

<<<

 sales to Russia) were to original equipment manufacturers, marine and industrial customers, and 57% of TI's external sales (on a gross basis, excluding sales to Russia) were to HVAC customers. For the year ended December 31, 2013, of TI's sales

<<<

 on a gross basis, excluding sales to Russia, 45% were for new non-residential construction, 35% were for renovation projects and 20% were for new residential construction. Our major customers are technical insulation dealers (accounting for

<<<

 72% of total TI division sales (on a gross basis excluding sales to Russia) for the year ended December 31, 2013) and insulation contractors (accounting for 15% of total TI division sales (on a gross basis excluding sales to Russia) for the

<<<

 year ended December 31, 2013). Industrial customers accounted for 11% of total TI division sales (on a gross basis excluding sales to Russia) for the year ended December 31, 2013 and other customers accounted for 3% of total TI division sales

<<<

 (on a gross basis excluding sales to Russia) for the year ended December 31, 2013.
Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning ("HVAC")
HVAC systems in buildings perform many roles, and generally HVAC systems are insulated, especially in Nordic

<<<

 countries, where there are strict insulation requirements. HVAC applications of Paroc products include insulation for heating and water pipes, drain pipes and wastewater pipes, ventilation systems (including thermal insulated ducts, fire insulated

<<<

 ducts and noise reduction), HVAC equipment and smoke and exhaust pipes.
Our core HVAC markets are Sweden (27% of HVAC external sales (excluding sales to Russia) for the year ended December 31, 2013) and Finland (22% of HVAC external sales 

<<<

(excluding sales to Russia) for the year ended December 31, 2013), Poland (9% of HVAC external sales (excluding sales to Russia) for the year ended December 31, 2013), Germany (8% of HVAC external sales (excluding sales to Russia) for the year

<<<

 ended December 31, 2013) and the United Kingdom (7% of HVAC external sales (excluding sales to Russia) for the year ended December 31, 2013), and sales to the HVAC market were 77.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, representing

<<<

 approximately 57% of total TI external sales (on a gross basis, excluding sales to Russia). Our major customers are technical insulation dealers and insulation contractors.
Process industries (oil and gas, petrochemical, power generation)
Customer

<<<

 requirements are varied, depending on the nature of the process industry; however, process industry customers demand long-lasting, maintenance-free and energy efficient insulation solutions. Product offerings to process industries include insulation

<<<

 for straight pipelines, pipe elbows, valves and flanges, tanks, boilers, heat exchanges and vessels, filters, flue ducts and industrial chimneys. An important property of Paroc products is their low chloride and fluoride content, which helps

<<<

 to minimize the risk of corrosion under the insulation.
The geography of our process industry customer base is diverse and includes Finland, Germany, Sweden, Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Sales to the process industry

<<<

 market were 27.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, representing approximately 20% of total TI external sales (on a gross basis, excluding sales to Russia). Distribution channels vary country-by-country; in the Nordic countries,

<<<

 industrial insulation products are sold mainly to contractors, however, in continental Europe, technical insulation dealers act as a key route to market.
128

Marine and Offshore
Our marine and offshore insulation has been developed to meet

<<<

 the needs of the modern shipbuilding and offshore industry. Insulation (especially fire-resistant insulation) is important in the construction of passenger cruise vessels. The products and structures used in ships must be fire tested and approved

<<<

 according to the rules and regulations of the International Maritime Organization (IMO). We have several approvals for A60, A30 and A15 class solutions for steel and aluminum decks and bulkheads ("A" indicates a maritime approval and the number

<<<

 indicates the minutes of fire resistance). For offshore applications we have approvals for H120 and H60 steel decks and bulkheads ("H" indicates an offshore approval and the number indicates the minutes of fire resistance). We also offer insulation

<<<

 products for marine air ducts and pipes as well as cabins and corridors.
Our core markets for marine and offshore products are Italy (30% of marine and offshore sales (excluding sales to Russia) for the year ended December 31, 2013), Finland

<<<

 (22% of marine and offshore sales (excluding sales to Russia) for the year ended December 31, 2013) and Germany (10% of marine and offshore sales (excluding sales to Russia) for the year ended December 31, 2013), where major European shipyards

<<<

 for cruise liners and "roll-on-roll-off" ferries are located. Sales to the marine and offshore market were 14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, representing 10% of total TI external sales (on a gross basis, excluding sales to

<<<

 Russia). In Italy, we sell through an Italian distributor with whom we have a long relationship, and outside of Italy, marine insulation products are typically sold directly to the shipyard or contractor.
Original equipment manufacturers (

<<<

"OEM")
In the equipment manufacturing industry, insulation is required to increase the energy efficiency of equipment, for fire protection and for sound attenuation. The OEM market requires insulation for specialized equipment (for example boilers

<<<

, silencers, air conditioning equipment and exhaust pipes, among others), which must meet individual customers' requirements that may vary on a case-by-case basis. We invest a significant amount of time building relationship with OEM customers

<<<

; we identify a need for the use of insulation, and we then work with the customer to develop tailor-made products.
Our core OEM markets are Finland (23% of OEM external sales (excluding sales to Russia) for the year ended December 31, 2013

<<<

), France (20% of OEM external sales (excluding sales to Russia) for the year ended December 31, 2013) and Sweden (19% of OEM external sales (excluding sales to Russia) for the year ended December 31, 2013). Sales to the OEM market were 17.

<<<

7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, representing 13% of total TI external sales (on a gross basis, excluding sales to Russia). We typically sell directly to OEM customers and offer a tailor-made product.
Marketing
The routes to market

<<<

 for our TI products vary depending on the end market and geography. Most products are sold through contractors and distributors, with OEM and some marine products sold directly to customers. Our TI division marketing effort is led by dedicated

<<<

 sales personnel for all of its major markets. The sales team is split into three sales areas who each establish and maintain customer relationships with dealers, distributors, contractors and OEM customers. We continue to expand our portfolio

<<<

 of approved HVAC specifications and focus on strengthening customer relationships through being engrained within the process of customer product development.
Panel System
Overview
Our Panel System division manufactures sandwich facade panels

<<<

--lightweight steel-faced panels with an insulating core of stone wool. The main application of the panels produced by the Panel System division are in the industrial and commercial construction of warehouses, municipal buildings and offices

<<<

. For the year ended December 31, 2013, our Panel System division generated sales of 56.2 million (with external sales of 56.2 million, or 13.0% of our total sales).
129

Production process and product offerings
Production Process
Our panels

<<<

 are manufactured on an automated PPS production line at our Parainen plant. The stone wool is supplied by our Base Production division (sold through the BI division at fixed market prices negotiated annually on an arm's-length basis), which

<<<

 is produced at the Parainen plant adjacent to the PPS production line, and is put onto the PPS production line. The stone wool slabs are introduced into the production line machine and then fed through cutters in order to produce strips of

<<<

 lamellas. The lamellas are then cut with grooves in order to join the lengths together. Once joined, metal facings are bonded with adhesive onto both sides of the mineral wool core. The steel facings are of commercially available standard steel

<<<

 grades and coatings. For many years, the Finnish steel group Rautaruukki has been a major supplier. For the year ended December 31, 2013, the PPS production line at Parainen produced approximately 1.2 million m2of PPS products.
PPS provides

<<<

 solutions that are designed to provide everything needed to complete a structure: panels, accessories, fixings, flashings, profiles, sealants and lifting equipment, as well as design, service, logistical, installation and solid technical support

<<<

. When developing our product offerings, design and aesthetics are important to make our products attractive to architects. An important element of our product offering is our skilled staff. Our sales staff assists our customers in finding the

<<<

 best possible solutions for their specific projects and our project engineers ensure a smooth implementation of the project according to agreement, while our technical experts to give guidance in the design and selection of architectural and

<<<

 function structural solutions.
Original System
Our Original System products are panels for ordinary external walls, internal walls and ceilings where no special requirements exist. The Original System includes the original panel design (Paroc

<<<

 Original with ribs of 200mm) with the standard steel coating for external use made of PVDF and, for internal use, polyester.
Facade System
The Facade System includes a wide range of panel designs and "flashings" (a decorative element) and fixings

<<<

. The external surfaces of these panels are always coated with PVDF to guarantee a long-lasting appearance. Manufactured corner panels and the option for a special width range of 300-1,100mm add to the flexibility in design, and our other special

<<<

 panel range includes panels of varying sizes. The Facade System is used by architects for a more aesthetic finish.
Fire System
Fire System panels provide a complete solution for fire resistant facilities or interiors, with non-combustible panels

<<<

 and specially designed accessories. The products include fire resistant partitioning walls, ceilings and cladding walls. Panels meet the applicable national requirements for fire resistance up to four hours in walls and up to one and a half

<<<

 hours in ceilings. Fire System Panels are classified in Euroclass A2 and our structural stone wool core in Euroclass A1. Our products have been tested by appropriate third-party testing organizations.
Hygiene System
Hygiene System panels are

<<<

 designed for the food and electronics industries, and are manufactured with entirely smooth surfaces for internal use (food-safe coatings) and PVDF for external wall cladding surfaces, as well as stainless steel.
Acoustic System
Acoustic System

<<<

 panels are designed for internal walls and ceilings in industrial applications where special sound insulation or sound absorption is required. We use both Paroc original and perforated Paroc acoustic panels (the perforated surface on one side

<<<

 of the panel provides better sound absorption) for Acoustic System applications.
130

Build-on System
Paroc Built-on is a solution for additional cladding (cladding is the application of one construction material over another material) on

<<<

 Paroc sandwich panels, that combines facade panels with other cladding materials. The combination of Paroc panels and ceramic tiles, glass, timber or bricks can create new possibilities for facade design. Because of the properties of our panels

<<<

, customers are able to install additional cladding materials directly to panel facing.
Customers and marketing
Panels are primarily sold in our core panel markets of Sweden (32% of PPS sales for the year ended December 31, 2013), Finland (

<<<

20% of PPS sales for the year ended December 31, 2013), Norway (15% of PPS sales for the year ended December 31, 2013) and Denmark (10% of PPS sales for the year ended December 31, 2013) and are also sold throughout western and central Europe

<<<

 (including Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, the Baltic States and the United Kingdom), as well as to the Middle East on a project basis. For the year ended December 31, 2013, 66% of PPS sales (by surface area) were for external

<<<

 wall panels, 24% for partitioning panels and 10% for ceiling panels.
Panels are produced and sold on a project basis and are sold directly to installers and contractors. All production is allocated by orders and panel pricing is usually determined

<<<

 on an individual contract-by-contract basis, with orders confirmed via a tendering process. Panel System has its own independent sales team, and we invest a significant amount of time in meeting customers and stakeholders, organizing industry

<<<

 education seminars to demonstrate the quality of Paroc panels, as well as advertising our products and new features in construction magazines. Our sales team has a two-pronged marketing strategy: we target architects or building owners to educate

<<<

 them in the advantages of Paroc products, with the objective that they specify panels to be ``Paroc or similar'' in their design specification which is sent to contractors and also market to the major contractors or panel installers to ensure

<<<

 that we are included in any tender for construction projects. We have strong relations with certain building project management companies that deal in large-scale projects across Europe, and we often secure orders for panels from architects

<<<

 that specify the use of Paroc panels in their building plans We generally have orders five to six weeks in advance, and peak orders are during April-June and September-November (before the beginning of winter).
Russian expansion
Overview
We

<<<

 have historically sold our products through sales offices in Russia, and made the decision in 2011 to expand and build a production facility to directly serve what we believe to be a growth market for Paroc. There is substantial demand for

<<<

 new housing stock and renovation and modernization of existing housing stock, driven by new federal governmental projects and housing programs. We sold 24 thousand tonnes of insulation in Russia in the year ended December 31, 2012 and 30 thousand

<<<

 tonnes in the year ended December 31, 2013. Our products compete in the Russian stone wool market as a premium product with a strong service offering and a reputation for best-in-class product quality.
We intend for our Russian operations to

<<<

 be a stand-alone business unit consisting of a building insulation unit, a technical insulation unit as well as a base production unit designed to supply all Paroc stone wool products sold in the Russian market. The base production plant at

<<<

 Tver began commercial operations in January 2014 with one base production line. For the year ended December 31, 2013, our Russian operations generated sales of 32.3 million (or 7.5% of our total sales).
We face certain challenges in Russia

<<<

 as we expand into a new emerging market and develop our in-country presence, including political instability in the region, as well as challenges in navigating the establishment and operation of a manufacturing facility in a new legal jurisdiction

<<<

. See Risk Factors--Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry-- We operate in emerging markets such as Russia, which exposes us to risks inherent to such less developed markets, and we may be exposed to greater risks as we intend to increase

<<<

 our operations in such markets" and "--We may not be able to successfully manage future growth, including by way of organic growth to new regions and potential acquisitions which may expose us to additional risks."
Tver Line 1
Following an

<<<

 extensive market review, we began construction of a production plant with a 50 thousand tonne base production line on a brownfield site (Izoplit) in Tver in 2012 at a total cost of 60 million. Our
131

new manufacturing facility in Tver employs

<<<

 96 employees, and began meaningful commercial production in January 2014 on one base production line. The plant uses best-in-class production practices utilizing Paroc "know-how" and technology from across the Group. Tver is strategically located

<<<

 between key target regions of Saint Petersburg and Moscow, allowing for ease of transport to end-customers within Russia.
Our Russian operations are being provided with ongoing marketing and operational support by the main Paroc BI, TI and

<<<

 Base Production divisions as it ramps up its production and sales activities. Local production allows us to be more competitive in the market due to lower production and transportation costs along with the elimination of high import duties

<<<

. Production at the Tver plant will replace a substantial majority of historical imports from plants in neighboring countries that currently supply the Russian market (in particular Lappeenranta and Vilnius).
The raw materials for our Russian

<<<

 production include coke sources from Ukraine, locally sourced resin and locally sourced stones, as well as certain stone sourced from our quarries in Finland. Because of the recent political instability in the Ukraine, we have put in place

<<<

 contingency plans to source our coke from the Czech Republic and Poland if the need arises. See "Risk Factors--Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry-- Our business may be negatively affected by volatility in raw and other material

<<<

 prices, our inability to retain or replace our key suppliers, unexpected supply shortages and disruptions o f the supply chain."

Tver Line 2 and TI production
We believe Russia (which accounted for 7.5% of the Group's revenue for the financial

<<<

 year ended December 31, 2013) represents an attractive growth market for our business. Accordingly, we are currently considering a plan to significantly expand our production capacity at our new manufacturing facility in Tver by adding a second

<<<

 production line for the manufacture of base stone wool (``Tver Line 2"), as well as additional machinery that would provide us with off-line TI production capacity in Russia. This second phase of our Russian expansion remains subject to internal

<<<

 approval, which we would not expect to receive prior to the second half of 2014. In the event that we proceed with the second phase of our Russian expansion, we expect that we will make total capital expenditures in the amount of approximately

<<<

 75 million during the 18 to 24 month period following any decision to proceed with the project. We expect that we would fund these capital expenditures using cash generated by our operating activities.

(3) These plants also have special product production equipment.
(4) Meaningful commercial production commenced in January 2014.
(5) Lappeenranta is scheduled to cease operations by the end of 2016. See ``--Lappeenranta closure."

<<<

 We have ceased production on one of the Base production lines as of February 2014, and two TI production lines are scheduled to be shut down during 2014. Most of the special product production at Lappeenranta has been transferred and is in

<<<

 use at other production facilities. The remaining Base production line will be shut down in 2016.

132

Lappeenranta closure
Our Lappeenranta plant is scheduled for closure in 2016. It is located on a leased site at the edge of a limestone

<<<

 quarry and is situated over a valuable limestone deposit. We lease the land from Nordkalk, with the lease scheduled to expire in May 2019. Nordkalk has indicated that it will not renew the lease as it requires access to the limestone deposits

<<<

 under the plant, and we have agreed to close down the plant by the end of 2016, and, where feasible, will transfer operations and production equipment to other production plants. Although the shutdown and production transfer process is a challenging

<<<

 task for our group, we have transferred equipment in the past and a project plan and process is in place to minimize disruption to customers. The shutdown and facility transfer phase is in process (it began in 2013) with Base Production shifting

<<<

 to Oulu, Parainen, Hallekis, Trzemeszno and our new Tver plant in Russia (see ``--Russian expansion"), TI production transferred to Hallekis, Trzemeszno, Skovde and Tver. Two of the TI production lines will be shut down in 2014, with the other

<<<

 two to be shut down in 2016. Most of the special product production equipment has already been transferred and is in use at other production facilities. All employees have been informed of the plans, and we have engaged with all employees to

<<<

 relocate internally where possible, and otherwise to support further education and transfer of skills to new professions. We believe that the plans have been well received by our employees due to the transparency of the shutdown procedure,

<<<

 combined with engagement and support from Paroc in assisting with the process.
We estimate the total cost of the transfer process to be approximately 7 million in capital expenditures and 1.3 million in operational expenditures from 2013 to

<<<

 2016, with an estimated 9.0 million in demolition and land clearing costs. We have estimated that there will be productivity, labor efficiency and other incremental costs over the duration of the transfer period. One production line has been

<<<

 shut down from February 2014. See "Risk Factors--Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry--Interruptions in operations at our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations

<<<

 and cash flows' and "-- The closure of the Lappeenranta facility may result in greater costs or disruptions to our business than currently expected. "

Competition
The main competition we face in the building insulation and technical insulation markets is from regional and global stone wool companies (including Rockwool) (that may also participate in the sandwich panel market) and regional

<<<

 and global multi-material companies (including Isover (Saint-Gobain), Knauf, Ursa

133

and TechnoNICOL). These markets tend to have larger, international participants due to the large level of investment needed. The main competition we face

<<<

 in the sandwich panels market is from facade manufacturers (including small, local companies as this market requires lower levels of investment) and global building materials producers and steel producers.
We also face competition from other

<<<

 insulation materials. Given the similarities in properties, application and production, the main competitor to stone wool is glass wool. Mineral wools (comprising stone wool and glass wool) typically do not materially overlap with foam insulation

<<<

 in building or technical insulation uses. However, there is a material area of overlap between mineral wool and foam insulation in external facades and roofs, as well as in sandwich panels, where mineral wool and foams are relatively more substitutable

<<<

. In instances where mineral wool and foam insulation are relatively substitutable, we believe customers often prefer to use mineral wool products due to superior thermal insulation and fire safety properties, among others, as compared to foam

<<<

 products, which are often slightly lower cost and take up less space than mineral wool products. Within mineral wool, both stone wool and glass wool have their advantages and disadvantages. Stone wool is typically easier to install than glass

<<<

 wool and has superior properties for fire, heat and sound resistance. Stone wool also handles moisture slightly more effectively than glass wool insulation. However, low density glass wool insulation is easier to transport than stone wool due

<<<

 to better compressibility and is also cheaper than stone wool in low density insulation products. Typically, the choice of insulation used in construction activities between stone wool and glass wool varies by market and depends to a considerable

<<<

 degree on regional and local building traditions, exterior climate and applicable technical and legal construction requirements. For example, according to our estimates, stone wool has historically been the most frequently used building insulation

<<<

 material in the Nordic countries and the Baltic States, and according to our estimates substitution between insulation materials has generally been relatively limited overall in those markets in recent years. Also see ``Industry."
The building

<<<

 insulation market is characterized by consolidated local markets with a larger variance in building habits, norms and product use between neighboring countries than in the technical insulation or sandwich panels markets, limited product transportability

<<<

 with a fragmented customer base, with products sold through direct sales and dealer sales. Price sensitivity depends on the tier (i.e., quality) of the product offering, and we operate in the higher tiers. The technical insulation market is

<<<

 characterized by consolidated regional markets, with a relatively price insensitive, highly fragmented customer base, and products sold through direct sales to contractors and manufacturers and dealer sales. The sandwich panels market is characterized

<<<

 by more consolidated and more national markets (although more fragmented in central Europe), a higher level of imports than in the BI or TI markets, with the majority of sales to specialist contractors (low price sensitivity) and a plurality

<<<

 to primary contractors (higher price sensitivity).
We believe that we differentiate ourselves with a premium, high-quality product, supported by a full-service sales and technical support offering. We target niche segments for growth where

<<<

 demand is strong for our high-specification products, such as Norway (BI flexible slabs and TI products for the oil and gas industry); Germany (BI slabs and TI HVAC/industrial processes); and Russia (high-value TI pipe sections for the power

<<<

 and gas sectors).
Research and Development
We consider innovation to be among the key factors for the further development of our product offerings and brands. Our research and development activities primarily aim to add innovative functions

<<<

 and applications to our products and optimize the quality and complementary nature of our product portfolio and application services, particularly in core areas to enable improved energy efficiency, product properties and sustainability and

<<<

 production processes. We are working to change Paroc to be both more innovative internally (through the development and use of new technologies and new ways of operating as an organization), and innovative in product development (through the

<<<

 development of new products and services to meet the needs of our customers and the development of new products based on our perception of potential needs in the market). Our divisions work together to create new innovative solutions (for example

<<<

 the collaboration between PPS and BI and the collaboration between Base Production and BI, both to develop new products).
The core production machinery and technology that we use in our production process is proprietary and developed in-house

<<<

. Our Base Production R&D is responsible for research and development related to stone wool properties and production technology, and is located in Parainen, Finland. Base production R&D focuses on four main areas: raw materials (quality and

<<<

 cost-efficiency of internal and external stone raw materials), process development (the development of Paroc technology, especially core technology
134

areas), binder and product properties (product development for the sales division, fiber

<<<

 properties and binder-related development) and R&D laboratory (supporting plants in quality assurance, as well as supporting development projects with in-depth support on production technology and/or stone wool properties and the development

<<<

 of new analysis and quality assurance methods). TI R&D is responsible for product development, with a focus on developing new products and solutions mainly for its end-user markets. BI R&D is responsible for maintaining and developing its products

<<<

, solutions and service range by identifying and prioritizing customer needs and coordinating those needs with Base Production capabilities as well as with TI production for roof and acoustic insulation products. In PPS, the focus is on product

<<<

 and application development, for example for new services, new features, new specification and new certifications based on our perception of potential needs in the market, requests from customers for new services and requests from architects

<<<

 and others for new features of PPS products.
We receive certain subsidies from the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation for research and development financing of certain R&D projects.
Total research and development expenditures

<<<

 for the year ended December 31, 2013 were 6.3 million and for the year ended December 31, 2012 were 6.9 million.
Cost-management
We have a well-defined set of ``operational excellence" initiatives which aim to continue to deliver significant

<<<

 savings in the medium term. We anticipate that these savings will primarily come from our Base Production division, with one of the key sources of cost reduction expected to be energy efficiency measures, specifically by reducing energy consumption

<<<

 throughout the production process. We intend to continue to manage our cost base effectively and generate margin enhancement through operational leverage (through overhead dilution and the benefits of higher capacity utilization on production

<<<

 costs) as we grow our volumes. A particular focus is on increasing energy efficiency. There is no assurance that we will be able to deliver all of our expected cost-savings. See ``Risk Factors--Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry

<<<

-- We may not realize any or all of our anticipated cost savings and productivity and efficiency gains with respect to our cost savings programs."
Information Technology
Business critical IT has been consolidated at the Group level, but consolidation

<<<

 is ongoing for non-business critical IT. We currently have 35 business core applications. Our key applications include our main platform, the Enterprise Resource Planning solution provided by IFS. Other important applications are provided by

<<<

 Modultek, Oracle, Tieto and Syncron Tech.
Intellectual Property
We currently own 332 registered trademarks and 513 registered patents (and patent applications) worldwide. Our most important patents focus on the production of mineral wool, including

<<<

 raw material mix, the methods and process of mineral wool manufacturing and related equipment. Our proprietary technology differentiates our products, and we focus on developing and protecting intellectual property as part of our drive for

<<<

 innovation.
The majority of our material intellectual property rights are currently held on a "central" basis by Paroc Oy Ab (with some less material intellectual property rights held by other Paroc Group companies). Paroc Oy Ab then licenses

<<<

 the other Paroc Group companies to use the Paroc Group intellectual property. We recently completed a reorganization of our intellectual property arrangements, which has resulted in our material intellectual property being held by Paroc Group

<<<

 Oy. We have in the past licensed our proprietary technology (including associated patents) to third parties, including to some of our competitors; however, this practice has ended (although some of the licensing agreements entered into in the

<<<

 past are still in place), and we do not plan on entering into any new licensing agreements in the future. We have not entered into any licensing agreements regarding intellectual property rights, either as licensor or as licensee, that are

<<<

 material to our business.
We are not aware of any major legal proceedings that have been brought against us for infringement of a patent or trademark or of any proceedings brought against any of our patents that could have a material adverse

<<<

 effect on our business if we would not prevail in such proceedings. We have regularly taken action to assert our intellectual property rights and we cooperate with local authorities against product piracy. We do, from time to time, face incidents

<<<

 of infringement of our intellectual property, and currently there are
135

two companies which may be infringing upon our patented technology, and we are in the process of evaluating the proper course of action. We have recently settled a

<<<

 dispute with another company over the other company's use of red and white stripes. See "Risk Factors--Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry--Any threat to, or impairment of, our intellectual property rights could cause us to incur

<<<

 costs to defend these rights."
In addition, our expansion into the Russian market has brought with it certain challenges with respect to intellectual property. For example, we face challenges in properly documenting trademark licensing from

<<<

 the Paroc Group to our Russian operations, filing trademark applications in Russia for all product names, filing for intellectual property protection in Belarus and Kazakhstan (both of which are in a customs union with Russia), the establishment

<<<

 of a proper legal framework for the protection of commercial secrets and doing diligence on potential imitators in the Russian market. See "Risk Factors--Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry--Any threat to, or impairment of, our intellectual

<<<

 property rights could cause us to incur costs to defend these rights." We are in the process of addressing these challenges to ensure protection of our intellectual property.
Safety systems
In 2011, we established a health and safety program

<<<

 with the goal of becoming an accident-free workplace. The Occupational Health and Safety ("OHS") function of the Group is situated in the Base Production division, supporting operations at all sites. The OHS function is steered by a Group-wide

<<<

 Health and Safety steering group, and line organization functions are supported through a Group-wide OHS team. The site supervisor at each of our facilities acts as the health and safety manager.
Over 2011-2013, the number of accidents at our

<<<

 sites has decreased from 126 in 2011 to 56 in 2012 to 40 in 2013, and lost-time injury frequency per million hours of work ("LTIF 1") decreased from 25.1 in 2011 to 12.4 in 2012 to 8.3 in 2013 and lost-time injury frequency resulting in leave

<<<

 of three or more days per million hours of work (``LTIF 3") decreased from 17.9 in 2011 to 8.3 in 2012 to 4.9 in 2013. We have taken a number of actions designed to maintain a safe environment at our sites: openly presenting the accident status

<<<

 of each site, properly marking safe passageways in factories, tracking safety performance indicators, recording incidents, identifying their causes and putting remedial actions into place where warranted and conducting safety inspections of

<<<

 our sites.
The Trzemeszno facility is the only facility with a ISO18001 (Occupational Health and Safety Management) certificate, however we believe that all of our facilities operate to the ISO18001 standard, and we hope that the other sites

<<<

 will be certified over the next several years. Our Finnish organization has been a member of the Zero Accident Forum (which is coordinated by the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health) since 2011.
Environmental matters
The conduct of our

<<<

 operations requires compliance with regulatory regimes designed to protect the environment, including, among other areas, air emissions (including carbon trading), use of chemicals and waste handling. We endeavor to comply with all known environmental

<<<

 regulations and we are not aware of any material breaches of applicable environmental regulations by any member of the Paroc Group. In addition, each of our production facilities (except Tver) is certified to the ISO14001 (Environmental Management

<<<

) standard. We believe that the operations at Tver are in line with the ISO14001 standard, but we have not yet applied for certification. Each of our facilities has an appointed environmental manager.
We have made certain provisions in our financial

<<<

 statements for environmental matters. These environmental provisions cover the costs from future closure of quarries related to landscaping, security arrangements and stacking area lining work and future closure of dumpsites related to landscaping

<<<

. The provisions for dumpsites are estimated to be used between 2014 and 2019. The provisions for quarries are estimated to be used between 2020 and 2096, and as of December 31, 2013, a non-cash provision of 7.3 million has been recognized.

<<<

 A provision of 6.9 million has been recognized as of December 31, 2013 for demolishing and other closure costs related to the Lappeenranta production facilities. These costs are expected to be incurred by the end of 2018.
The Environmental

<<<

 & Sustainability function of the Group is situated in the Base Production division, supporting operations at all sites. A few of the major EU-wide environmental legal regimes to which we are subject are described below. For more information

<<<

, and for country-specific environmental regulations to which we are subject, see ``Regulation" and "Risk Factors--Risks Related to Our Business and Our
136

Industry-- We are subject to numerous environmental, building, health and safety regulations

<<<

, technical standards and other regulations."

EU Emissions Trading Scheme ("EU ETS")
The EU ETS works to cap the total amount of certain greenhouse gases that can be emitted by factories, power plants and other entities through three phases

<<<

 with the intention to lower the emission of greenhouse gas emissions over the life of the scheme. The manufacture of stone wool was not included in Phase I of the EU ETS. In Phase II (2008-2012), only facilities with two or more production

<<<

 lines were included, which included our Trzemeszno, Vilnius, Hllekis, Parainen and Lappeenranta production facilities. These facilities participated in Phase II as combustion plants (with thermal output of more than 20 MW). Our production

<<<

 facilities at Oulu and Hssleholm are required to participate in Phase III (2013-2020). Our production facilities at Skvde and the PPS production facility at Parainen are not currently subject to EU ETS.
We manage emissions allowances at the

<<<

 Paroc Group level. We received an allocation of free emissions allowances in Phase II, many of which we reserved for future use. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we were required to use a portion of our reserved emissions allowances as

<<<

 our actual emissions exceeded our allocation of free emissions allowances for 2013. As of December 31, 2013, we have 430,387 emissions allowances held in reserve. In addition, "Carbon Leakage" status is granted by the European Commission (after

<<<

 agreement by Member States and the European Parliament) to (usually energy-intensive) industries that are deemed to face competition from non-EU countries with less stringent greenhouse gas emissions restrictions. We received ``Carbon Leakage

<<<

" status for 2013-2014 and all Paroc production facilities subject to the EU ETS are therefore allocated free emissions allowances corresponding to our sector-specific ``benchmark value". We currently hope to receive this status again for 2

<<<

015-2019; the mineral wool sector has again been specified as a sector deemed to be exposed to a significant risk of carbon leakage in the draft European Commission decision published on May 5, 2014 regarding the 2015-2019 carbon leakage list

<<<

, although there is no guarantee that the sector will be included in the list ultimately adopted by the European Commission following scrutiny by the EU Climate Change Committee, the European Parliament and the Council. Even assuming that Carbon

<<<

 Leakage status is maintained throughout Phase III, we estimate that we will have an average annual shortfall of approximately 29% in emissions allowances across the whole Paroc Group throughout Phase III. This shortfall will be greater if Carbon

<<<

 Leakage status is not maintained after 2014. In addition, new production capacity may not be eligible for Carbon Leakage status, unless the operations meet the required criteria for new entrants. Our intention is to use the free emissions allowances

<<<

 that we had purchased and reserved in Phase II to spread the cost of purchasing the necessary additional emissions allowances over a longer period of time. Nonetheless, we expect the future cost of purchasing necessary additional emissions

<<<

 allowances to be material, although we do not have an estimate at this time given that the emissions allowance market is an open market with fluctuating prices. See ``Risk Factors--Risk Related to Our Business and Our Industry--Regulations

<<<

 regarding carbon dioxide emissions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations."
The following chart shows our emissions allowances for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 201

EU Packaging

<<<

 and Packaging Waste Directive
The packaging of our stone wool products is covered by the EU packaging and packaging waste directive, and complies with the directive through the applicable national packaging waste recycling system (REPA in Sweden

<<<

, the Environmental Register of Packaging (PYR) Ltd in Finland, by engaging a specialized recovery organization (organizacja odzysku)--TOM S.A.--in Poland, and Pakuociu tvarkymo organizacija in Lithuania).

137

Registration, Evaluation, Authorization

<<<

 and Restriction of Chemicals ("REACH")
REACH was implemented to increase the protection of human health and the environment through measures designed to improve the safe use of chemical substances. REACH requires companies that put chemical

<<<

 substances on the EU market to secure the safe use of such chemicals. REACH requires that, unless exempt, all chemicals and substances manufactured, imported, or used within the EU must be registered with the European Chemicals Agency (``ECHA

<<<

").
We registered our stone wool fiber, a man-made vitreous (silicate) fiber, with the ECHA in September 2010 and we believe we are compliant with the REACH regulations. Our ECHA registration covers the stone wool fiber used in all of our products

<<<

. We are a part of the man-made vitreous fibers consortia, which manages the registration process.

EU Directive on Industrial Emissions ("IED")
The goal of the IED is to reduce pollution resulting from industrial activities through the establishment

<<<

 of a general framework for the control of industrial activities, including a "polluter pays" principle.
Sweden implemented the IED in 2013. Our Hllekis and Hssleholm facilities will be required to conduct baseline studies to evaluate soil

<<<

 and groundwater contamination by 2016 or in connection with the application for an environmental permit application or an amendment to an existing permit. Skovde is exempt from environmental permitting. In Finland, the IED is to be incorporated

<<<

 into Finnish law by a revision of the Finnish Environmental Protection Act expected to enter into force during 2014, after which the obligation to perform baseline studies will apply to all of our Finnish facilities. Lappeenranta, which will

<<<

 shut down operations in 2016, is already required to conduct a baseline report on soil contamination by the end of October 2015. In Poland, the implementation process has been delayed and is expected to be completed during 2014, after which

<<<

 the obligation to perform baseline studies will apply to our Polish facilities as well. However, in Poland the first baseline report will have to be prepared not for the first IED implementation-related adjustment of our IPPC permit (to be

<<<

 performed within 3 months after entry into force of the implementing legislative amendment), but rather for any subsequent change of the IPPC permit. In Lithuania, it is currently unclear precisely when the IED will be implemented, although

<<<

 under a plan agreed by the European Commissions and the Lithuanian government implementation is currently expected to take place between January 1, 2016 and June 30, 2020. We also anticipate that certain of our facilities (namely Hassleholm

<<<

, Oulu and Parainen) will need to make certain IED-related improvements in order to remain compliant with ``best available techniques" requirements under the directive by April 2016, which may require significant capital expenditures--more specifically

<<<

, we currently expect to expend approximately 0.7 million on such improvements at our Oulu facility, and 2.6 million on such improvements at our Parainen facility. No such material expenditures are currently anticipated at our Hassleholm facility

<<<

, though if planned actions to tune production and raw material parameters are not successful, it is possible that we may be required to invest approximately 0.7 million on IED-related improvements.
See ``Regulation" for more information on

<<<

 EU-wide regulations, as well as information on national environmental law.

We have

<<<

 not suffered any material work stoppages or strikes in recent years, and we consider relations with our employees, works councils and unions to be satisfactory. As of December 31, 2013, we estimate that in Finland, approximately 98% of our

<<<

 blue collar and 85% of our white collar employees were represented by labor unions, in Sweden, approximately 95% of our blue collar and 75% of our white collar employees were represented by labor unions, in Poland, approximately 40% of our

<<<

 blue collar and 20% of our white collar employees were represented by labor unions and in Lithuania, 15% of our blue collar employees were represented by labor unions. These unionization percentages are not uncommon in the respective jurisdictions

<<<

. There is currently no unionization at our Russian facility. There are collective bargaining agreements in place in Finland, Sweden and Lithuania. In Poland, we have a set of "Regulations" related to, for example, remuneration which have been

<<<

 drafted according to the Polish Labor Code, issued by Paroc Polska Sp. z o.o. and approved by the trade unions active in Paroc Polska Sp. z o.o.
We operate a number of pension schemes following local regulation and practice in each country

<<<

 in which we operate. These pension schemes are classified as either defined benefit plans or defined contribution plans. In Finland, employees are insured in accordance with the Employees' Pension Act. The earningsrelated pension provision

<<<

 is handled by pension insurance companies and it is classified as a defined contribution plan. Statutory earnings-related pension insurance provides security in case of old age, disability and death of the family provider. The earnings-related

<<<

 benefits also include rehabilitation. Top management located in Finland and Sweden has individual voluntary pension plans. These plans entitle a pension at the age of 62. The plan was changed in 2010 so that it is classified as a defined contribution

<<<

 plan. The old defined benefit plan in Finland has been terminated.
As part of the Finnish statutory defined-benefit pension scheme, there has been a system of registered supplementary pensions that was created to supplement the statutory pension

<<<

 scheme. The registered supplementary pension system was closed to new insureds in 2001, but approximately 90 of our employees are still covered by this scheme. However, due to legislative changes, such schemes will have to be discontinued by

<<<

 the year 2016. We may therefore be obligated to agree on a new pension arrangement with the employees who have not yet retired but are within the scheme by, for example, taking out a group life insurance policy for the relevant employee. Upon

<<<

 the occurrence of certain conditions the employer may pay a lump-sum payment. Depending on the arrangements chosen, such a change may cause additional costs to us in the form of several lump-sum payments or increased insurance costs.
Apart

<<<

 from the statutory old age pension, the main pension schemes operated in Sweden are pension obligations derived from the applicable collective bargaining agreements. For blue collar employees the SAF/LO pension scheme applies with pension premiums

<<<

 paid to Fora and for white collar employees the ITP pension plan applies with pension premiums paid to Collectum/Alecta. It should be noted that pension obligations in relation to white collar employees under the ITP pension plan up to and

<<<

 including March 1994 is primarily a PRI solution. A PRI solution enables a company to retain the pension capital within the company. Under the PRI plan, the company makes an annual provision in its balance sheet corresponding to the value of

<<<

 accrued pension entitlements. The current pension obligations are both defined benefit and defined contribution plans depending on the age of the employee and the applicable collective agreement. A couple of key employees are entitled to an

<<<

 additional pension arrangement. The employees are under the collective bargaining agreements covered by certain collectively agreed insurances such as work injury insurance and group life insurance. The old pension liability in Sweden for white

<<<

 collar employees is still accounted for as a defined benefit plan in the financial statements (retirement obligation up to March 31, 1994). The current pension plan (for white collar employees) has been accounted for as a defined contribution

<<<

 plan in our financial statements included herein.
In Lithuania, pension premiums are paid in every salary payment as a percentage of gross salary. These pensions are funded by the state social insurance fund and treated as defined contribution

<<<

 plans. In Poland, there is a mandatory social security system, the payments for which are made monthly on the basis of actual value of salaries paid during the month and which is effectively treated as a defined contribution plan. In other

<<<

 countries the pension arrangements are done in accordance with the local legislation and practice and they are treated as defined contribution plans. In Russia we are subject to mandatory pension and other social contributions.
Properties
Finland

<<<


We own 11 properties in Finland, including one quarry and the production facility sites at Oulu and Parainen. We also lease a number of properties, including the land on which production facilities are
139

located and a landfill site (both

<<<

 at Lappeenranta, which is in the process of being shut down, see ``Divisions--Production facilities and inter-segment sales--Lappeenranta closure"), pay leasing fees for the Sallittu and Kangas quarries, office premises (including at Parainen

<<<

), land and a landfill site. We also hold mining district decisions (mining concessions) for eight quarries in Finland.
Sweden
We own three properties in Sweden, including three tracts of land for industrial purposes (relating to the Hllekis

<<<

 and Hssleholm production sites). We also lease certain other properties, including for industrial purposes, landfill sites, office space and storage space. We also lease the property and buildings for our Skovde production plant.
Poland
We

 own two land plots, and have a perpetual usufruct right (an ownership right limited in time (maximum period is 99 years, subject to further extension) over 10 land plots, all of which are in Trzemeszno, Poland. The land subject to the perpetual

<<<

 usufruct right is owned by the State Treasury or pertinent municipality, while the structures and buildings located thereon are owned by the perpetual usufructuary). These rights are generally scheduled to expire in 2089, unless extended. We

<<<

 also lease office premises in Poland.
Lithuania
We own 10 properties in Lithuania, all of which are in Vilnius. These properties include buildings on the site of the Vilnius production plant, although the land on which those buildings are situated

<<<

 is leased to us by the Republic of Lithuania. We also lease certain other properties, including a storage yard.
Russia
We own our production facility located in Tver, Russia, including several land plots. We also lease land in Tver (for a landfill

<<<

) and office premises in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Samara.
Insurance
We have obtained property, business interruption, public and products liability, directors' and officers' and other insurance coverage, to the extent we believe necessary

<<<

, to operate our business. We believe our liability insurance is sufficient to meet our needs in light of potential future litigation and claims asserted against us. For certain risks that we believe are minor, we are self-insured and have,

<<<

 when deemed commercially reasonable, insurance policies with deductibles. We are not insured against financial liabilities arising from soil, water and other forms of contamination. We regularly review our insurance program together with our

<<<

 insurance broker. We cannot guarantee, however, that we will not incur losses beyond the limits or outside the coverage of our insurance policies. In addition, longer interruptions of business in one or more of our plants can, even if insured

<<<

, result in loss of sales, profit, customers and market share.

We are party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Other than as described below under "--Tax dispute

<<<

 related to transferpricing, write-downs of intragroup loans and VAT" we are not currently involved in any legal proceedings nor are we aware of any threatened claims against us which we expect to have a material adverse effect on our financial

<<<

 position and results of operations.
Tax dispute related to transfer pricing, write-downs of intragroup loans and VAT
There is an open case with regard to transfer pricing practices at Paroc Oy Ab during 2006-2008. The Finnish tax authorities

<<<

 have made a tax reassessment concerning years 2006-2008, and based on tax decisions rendered in 2012 and 2013, Paroc Oy Ab would be required to pay in 22.3 million in taxes, penalties and interest. The amount includes 14.1 million of taxes

<<<

, 2.3 million of surtax and 5.9 million of accrued corporate interest and penalty interest (through December 31, 2013). Paroc Oy Ab has a different view of the transfer pricing of the Group's intra-group supply of raw materials, license fees

<<<

 and distributor services than the tax authorities and in February 2013, Paroc Oy Ab filed an appeal against the tax reassessment with the Board of Appeals. The company has been granted an interdiction of payment
140

related to the reassessed

<<<

 tax payments. This interdiction of payment is in force until the earlier of such time when the Board of Appeals renders a decision on the matter or January 31, 2015. If the appeal is lost, Paroc Oy Ab will be obligated to pay the taxes, penalties

<<<

 and interest, absent any successful subsequent appeal by us. The Group has not made a provision in the 2013 financial statements since management believes, supported by external legal advice that all transfer pricing guidelines have been followed

<<<

 and the same method has been followed from 2009 to 2013. If Paroc Oy Ab loses the appeal and any subsequent appeals, it may be required to pay additional taxes, penalties and interest for the period from 2009 to 2013. See "Risk Factors--Risks

<<<

 Related to Our Business and Our Industry--We are subject to risks from legal proceedings."
In addition to the appeal to the Board of Appeals, we have also made protective applications for a Mutual Agreement Procedure ("MAP"). A MAP provides

<<<

 for a corresponding adjustment to be agreed in another jurisdiction when a transfer pricing adjustment is applied, so that it is not a one-sided adjustment (i.e., additional income in Finland would have resulted in reduced profits in the corresponding

<<<

 group entity, based in another territory). A MAP does not cover surtaxes and interests. Due to, for example, differences in tax rates and tax positions of the relevant affiliated entities, part of the additional taxes payable in Finland cannot

<<<

 be recovered through a MAP. We have filed an application for a MAP with the relevant authorities in Poland, Sweden, Lithuania, Estonia, Denmark, Germany and Latvia (all based on the EU Arbitration Convention), and with the relevant authorities

<<<

 in Russia and Norway (based on tax treaties). MAP procedures can take a considerable amount of time; MAP negotiations based on the EU Arbitration Convention are limited to two years, after which time the case is referred to the advisory commission

<<<

 for resolution within 12 months. For intra-EU MAP procedures, a decision is to be reached between the two relevant tax authorities, providing relief for any additional income that is assessed in Finland through the open tax case. The amount

<<<

 of tax recoverable through an intra-EU MAP is approximately 8-12.1 million. For MAP negotiations based on tax treaties, there is no set time frame or possibility to refer the case to an advisory commission in case the authorities do not reach

<<<

 a conclusion. The amount of tax recoverable through a tax treaty based MAP is approximately 2 million. The surtaxes and interest (8.2 million) cannot be recovered through a MAP. The Finnish Competent Authorities will not start the MAP negotiations

<<<

 in our case until the appeal process is complete.
In 2012, the Finnish tax authorities conducted an audit of Paroc Oy Ab's tax return in respect of the financial year ended December 31, 2011 and assessed 7.6 million of additional taxable income

<<<

 on the basis that a deduction had been incorrectly claimed on write-downs of intragroup loans. The authorities also imposed an additional penalty of 370,000, which we have paid. We have appealed this assessment and the penalty and as a result

<<<

 of the appeal the penalty imposed has been reduced to 800. The Finnish tax authorities have appealed the reduction of the penalty and we have appealed the assessment of additional income to the taxable income. The proceedings before the Administrative

<<<

 Court in relation to the matter are currently pending. If the Finnish tax authorities are successful in the pending proceedings before the Administrative Court, we will not receive a refund of the penalty amount paid by us absent any successful

<<<

 subsequent appeal by us. See "Risk Factors--Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry--We are subject to risks from legal proceedings."
We are also currently involved in a material dispute arising from our operations in Poland. In 201

<<<

1, local authority sought to impose real property taxes for 2009 to 2011 in respect of an investment project at our Trzemeszno production facility in an amount totaling approximately PLN 2.2 million more than the amounts declared and paid by

<<<

 us for such taxes. To date we have been unsuccessful in disputing the imposition of these additional taxes in appeals to the Self-Government Appeal Court and Regional Administrative Court in Poznan. We are currently awaiting the outcome of

<<<

 a further appeal to the Supreme Administrative Court. While we await the outcome of our appeal, we have paid this additional tax amount, and have booked a tax receivable for which 100% of the provision is booked. See "Risk Factors--Risks Related

<<<

 to Our Business and Our Industry--We are subject to risks from legal proceedings."
We are also currently involved in a pending dispute with the Russian tax authorities in relation to the refusal by such authorities to permit ZAO Paroc to recover

<<<

 RUB 11.8 million (approximately 262,222) of VAT for the second quarter of 2013. ZAO Paroc expects to receive similar VAT recovery refusals for the third and fourth quarters of 2013 for the amount of RUB 9.2 million (approximately 204,444) and

<<<

 RUB 20 million (approximately 444,444), respectively. ZAO Paroc plans to settle this issue with the Russian tax authorities out-of-court by providing a revised tax return. See "Risk Factors--Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry--Pending

<<<

 and future tax audits within our Group and changes in fiscal regulations or the interpretations thereof could lead to additional tax liabilities."

REGULATION
Overview
In all of the jurisdictions in which we operate we are subject to numerous

<<<

 laws, rules and regulations at national, state and municipal levels, particularly building, environmental and occupational health and safety laws, rules and regulations, as well as technical standards. At the European level, the regulatory

<<<

 environment of our business includes several EU directives and regulations, which are either implemented in the individual Member States through national legislation or apply directly. As our business primarily comprises the manufacturing of

<<<

 building materials, such as insulation materials and sandwich panel products, laws, rules and regulations and technical standards that affect our operations mostly relate to energy efficiency, raw material extraction, environmental protection

<<<

 (in particular, in relation to soil, ground and surface water contaminations and air emissions), recultivation, reclamation and renaturation, as well as occupational health and safety.
We expect that in almost all of the countries in which

<<<

 we do or intend to do business laws, rules and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations, will over time become more comprehensive and stringent. We further expect that many environmental laws and regulations will be harmonized

<<<

 at the EU-level over the near- to medium-term. Further, the EU focus on raw materials supply may also result in new legislation targeting the extractive industry. Member States will, however, remain free to adopt laws and regulations that are

<<<

 more stringent than those required by the EU.
We are also required to obtain and maintain permits from governmental authorities for many of our operations, such as environmental permits, mining permits and emission permits. As the regulatory

<<<

 framework applicable to us is subject to revision and continuous development, it is very difficult to accurately predict the future cost of compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and technical standards. Additional or more stringent

<<<

 laws, rules, regulations and technical standards could increase our cost or limit our ability to continue our business operations in the same manner as we did in the past. See "Risk Factors--Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry--We

<<<

 are subject to numerous environmental, building, health and safety regulations, technical standards and other regulations."
Finland
In Finland, we are subject to a number of environmental laws and regulations which include the Finnish Environmental

<<<

 Protection Act (86/2000, Ymparistonsuojelulaki), the Finnish Waste Act (646/2011, Jatelaki), the Finnish Chemicals Act (599/2013, Kemikaalilaki), the Finnish Mining Act (621/2011, Kaivoslaki) and the Act on Compensation for Environmental Damage

<<<

 (737/1994, Laki ymparistovahinkojen korvaamisesta). We must also comply with numerous workplace safety and accident prevention statutes, such as the Finnish Occupational Safety and Health Act (738/2002, Tyoturvallisuuslaki). We are also subject

<<<

 to EU and national legislation on technical approval and unified criteria for construction products.
Soil and Groundwater Contamination
In Finland, we are subject to several laws relating to the use and contamination of soil as well as ground

<<<

 and surface water.
For example, the Finnish Environmental Protection Act regulates emissions into the environment, including surface water. Emissions into soil and groundwater are as a rule prohibited. Operations that may change or alter surface

<<<

 water such as the water level or flow of a river require a water permit in accordance with the Finnish Water Act (587/2011, Vesilaki).
Adverse effects to the environment resulting from industrial operations may lead to financial responsibility

<<<

 for the remediation of contaminated soil or groundwater. This responsibility is based on the Finnish Environmental Protection Act and is imposed by the environmental authorities irrespective of possible contractual arrangements. A contaminated

<<<

 area must be restored to a condition in which it will not cause harm to health or the environment or represent a hazard to the environment. Either the party that has originally caused the contamination (even if not negligent) or the party currently

<<<

 in possession of the contaminated area (for example, the current owner or tenant) may be required to assess the need for remediation and take the necessary actions required by the authorities. If contamination of groundwater occurs or is discovered

<<<

, the responsible party is usually subject to a comprehensive range of remediation obligations, which may be costly. In addition, in respect of environmental damage caused by operations carried out after June 1, 1995, a broad range of parties

<<<

 (including, for example, a parent company of the operator or equivalent of a facility) can be held strictly liable for such damage under the Act on Compensation for Environmental Damage (737/1994, Laki ymparistovahinkojen korvaamisesta).
The

<<<

 implementation of European Directive 2010/75/EC on industrial emissions (``IED Directive") in 2014 will put more focus on soil contamination monitoring and remediation levels in connection with
142

environmental permits. Operators will be

<<<

 required to complete a baseline report regarding the condition of soil and groundwater at the facility site that includes handling of relevant hazardous substances. The baseline report must be submitted to the permit authority as part of the

<<<

 permit application in connection with the review of an environmental permit or before new operations are initiated. This obligation is with respect to activities to which the IED applies. Lappeenranta, which will shut down operations in 20

<<<

16, is required to conduct a baseline report on soil contamination by the end of October 2015, based on its current environmental permit obligations.
Some Finnish environmental laws and regulations may impose liability and responsibility on

<<<

 present and former owners or operators of facilities and sites for contamination at such facilities or sites without regard to causation or knowledge of contamination. Our historical and current operations involve the use of hazardous substances

<<<

 and we operate or have operated production plants that are or have been located on sites with a long history of industrial use by third parties. Such previous activities have resulted in soil and groundwater contamination at some of our current

<<<

 and former sites or land adjacent to such sites. In some cases, we are responsible for further investigations, remediation and clean up actions, even though we may not have caused the contamination. Although we believe that we are generally

<<<

 in compliance with our legal obligations at our Finnish sites, soil and/or groundwater contamination has been detected at some of the sites (including Oulu and Parainen) and additional contamination of soil and groundwater may be discovered

<<<

 at these or other sites in the future, including in connection with the baseline studies described above. Such discovery of previously unknown contamination, or the imposition of new obligations to investigate or remediate soil or groundwater

<<<

 contamination, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operation. Moreover, regulatory authorities could suspend our operations or refuse to renew the permits and authorizations we require to

<<<

 operate. They could also mandate upgrades or changes to our processes that could result in significant costs to us. We anticipate that the countries where we do business will continue to develop increasingly strict environmental laws and regulations

<<<

 and to interpret and enforce existing laws and regulations more aggressively. This trend could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Emissions and Environmental Permits
Laws and regulations

<<<

 governing the emission of air pollutants, noise, odors and vibrations subject our industrial facilities to permitting and other compliance obligations. In some cases, a continuous improvement or retrofitting of installations to maintain facilities

<<<

 at "state of the art" safety standards may be required. Compliance with these requirements is monitored by local authorities and operators may be required to submit emission reports on a regular basis. Non-compliance with maximum emission levels

<<<

 may result in administrative fines, other administrative compulsion or, in Finland, criminal investigations.
In Finland, emissions to the environment and operations with environmental impacts are regulated by the Finnish Environmental Protection

<<<

 Act. The act contains a generally applied system of integrated pollution control based on an integrated environmental permit ("IPPC-type'' permit). Pursuant to the Act, an environmental permit is required for activities that pose a threat of

<<<

 environmental pollution, including impacts to all environmental media (e.g., soil, water and air). Activities subject to an environmental permit are non-exclusively listed in more detail in the Finnish Environmental Protection Decree (169/

<<<

2000, Ympdristdnsuojeluasetus). The scope of activities covered is broader than in the EU's IED Directive or European Directive 2008/1/EC on Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (``IPPC Directive"). Among others, the production of mineral

<<<

 products, waste disposal and mining are considered subject to an environmental permit. An environmental permit may be awarded if operations requiring the permit are not in conflict with a local detailed plan covering the area and do not result

<<<

 (either individually or in combination with other operations) in:
 harm to health;
 other significant environmental pollution or risk thereof;
 soil contamination or groundwater pollution;
 deterioration of special natural conditions or

<<<

 risk to water supply or other potential use important to the public interest in the operation's area of impact; and
 an unreasonable burden to adjacent or nearby properties.
Nature conservation requirements, such as the conservation of species

<<<

, must also be taken into account in the consideration of the permit. In addition, an environmental permit may not be granted if the planned project is contrary to a local detailed plan (being a form of land use plan). The current and future

<<<

 purpose of land use as indicated in a valid land use plan is hence assessed as part of the consideration of a permit application, and may affect the granting of a permit and the permit conditions.
143

Permit conditions regarding the prevention

<<<

 of pollution and emission thresholds are based on ``best available techniques.'' Permit conditions for existing operations will be required to be updated in accordance with any new, more stringent, standards that are promulgated. However, the

<<<

 permit authorities, in accordance with their discretionary powers, usually require old facilities to fulfill new standards only after certain transition periods, which can be flexible. The anticipated production amounts are described in environmental

<<<

 permit applications and repeated in permit decisions. If we increase our earlier notified production levels or waste or emission levels we will need to apply for a new environmental permit or a change to the current permit.
In January 2011

<<<

, the IED, which repealed the IPPC Directive and requires best available techniques ("BATs") to control emission levels, and sets out rules on the prevention and control of pollution from industrial activities and includes rules aimed at reducing

<<<

 emissions into the air, water and land, entered into force. The IED also aims to prevent the generation of waste in order to achieve a high level of overall environmental protection. The mineral industry (production of mineral fibers), the

<<<

 chemical industry and the waste management industry, among others, will potentially need to make changes to their operations in order to comply with the new obligations deriving from the IED. The IED is not applicable to mining operations,

<<<

 however.
Member States were required to implement the IED through national legislation by January 7, 2013. However, the implementation of the IED is currently ongoing in Finland. The IED is to be implemented by a revision of the Finnish Environmental

<<<

 Protection Act, which is ongoing, and the new act is expected to enter into force during 2014. The new act will replace and repeal the earlier Finnish Environmental Protection Act. Upon the entry into force of the new act, permit conditions

<<<

 will be required to be based upon the ``BAT conclusions'' set out in the BAT reference documents ("BREFs"). At that time, existing permits that are not in compliance with such standard will not be grandfathered in but will be adjusted with

<<<

 respect to the new standard. According to the current legislative draft of the Finnish Environmental Protection Act, the new BAT conclusions will be included in existing environmental permits through a permit review procedure and, as a general

<<<

 rule, implemented within four years from the publishing of the BREFs by the Commission.
All our production plants have in the past emitted, and will continue to emit, dust, odors, and hazardous and non-hazardous substances into the air, caused

<<<

 and will continue to cause noise, handled and stored and will continue to handle and store chemicals and hazardous substances, and generated and will continue to generate waste. We re-use process water at our facilities in large amounts. The

<<<

 process water loop is therefore as a rule closed and our waste water discharges to surface waters and sewers are correspondingly limited. No waste water is as a starting point discharged to ground water at our Finnish facilities. Therefore

<<<

, we do not regularly discharge process waste water. Sanitary waste water is discharged to the municipal sewers. The quarrying operations do not generate any waste water. Our air emissions originate mainly from the melting, spinning and curing

<<<

 processes. Our most significant air emissions include particulates, sulfur oxide, phenol, formaldehyde and ammonia.
Our Finnish facilities hold IPPC-type permits, which include restrictions on air emissions, wastewater discharges and noise

<<<

. The air emissions, water discharges and pollution control requirements of the permits for our operations in Finland are based on BAT standards. These are defined in the BREFs of the IPPC Directive. We believe we are in material compliance

<<<

 with our permits and applicable environmental laws and regulations. However, due to forthcoming implementation of the IED, we may need to incur capital expenditures in order to upgrade our systems to remain compliant with BAT requirements.

<<<

 We have been, and will continue to be, required to incur significant capital expenditures and operating costs in order to maintain and upgrade our production sites and facilities to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permits, and

<<<

 to obtain and maintain all necessary permits. We believe we will need to make certain IED-related improvements at our Oulu and Parainen facilities, which may require significant capital expenditures--we currently expect to expend approximately

<<<

 0.7 million on such improvements at our Oulu facility, and 2.6 million on such improvements at our Parainen facility. In addition, we may be required to incur significant capital expenditures to upgrade production plants by installing or improving

<<<

 technical equipment in order to match the decreasing amount of free emissions allowances available in the EU Emission Trading System. The maximum quantity of emission allowances will be reduced each year. See ``--Climate Change Law--Emission

<<<

 Trading Law in the European Union."
Violations of the Finnish environmental laws could lead to substantial costs and liabilities, including civil liabilities and criminal fines and penalties. Environmental compliance is an increasingly important

<<<

 consideration in our businesses as the enforcement environment has become more stringent in the past years, and we expect to continue to incur significant capital expenditures and operational and maintenance costs for environmental compliance

<<<

, including costs related to reductions in air emissions such as carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, wastewater discharges and solid and hazardous wastes. We closely monitor the potential for changes in pollution control laws and take

<<<

 actions with respect to our operations accordingly.
144

Waste
In Finland, we are subject to statutory provisions regarding waste management. These provisions may govern permissible methods of, and responsibility for, the generation, handling

<<<

, possession, discharge and recycling of waste depending, among other things, on the dangers posed by the waste. In particular, the discharge of waste is often restricted to licensed facilities. In many European jurisdictions, plants must use

<<<

 licensed contractors for the disposal of hazardous or nonhazardous waste. Under the Finnish Waste Act (646/2011, Jatelaki) the producer and holder of waste are responsible for organizing waste management. This includes the obligation to see

<<<

 to the appropriate disposal of waste to landfills and waste processing facilities. Product manufacturers are also responsible for obligations regarding the waste management of packaging waste. In accordance with the Finnish Waste Act, all waste

<<<

 management should comply with the order of priority, meaning that waste should primarily be reused, and secondarily recycled. If these options are not available, the waste should be "recovered," for example as energy. Disposal of waste is to

<<<

 be considered as a "last resort." In accordance with the "polluter-pays" principle, the original producer of waste is also liable for the costs of the waste management. The waste holder's responsibility for organizing waste management is terminated

<<<

 and transferred to a new holder when the waste is delivered to a lawful consignee, for example a professional waste treatment facility. The operator of a landfill is responsible for the waste, as well as the environmental impacts of the landfill

<<<

 after the closure of the landfill. The operator is obligated to keep a record of waste if the activity generates at least 100 tons of waste per year, generates hazardous waste or is subject to an environmental permit. With regard to hazardous

<<<

 waste there are special regulations regarding the packaging, labeling, mixing, storage and transport. The waste management and treatment of waste is generally undertaken by professional waste management and treatment companies.
Due to our manufacturing

<<<

 and mining operations we generate, inter alia, dust waste, stone wool waste, stone waste, industrial waste, iron waste and household waste. We are currently reusing and recycling large amounts of our non-hazardous waste in our production. Our

<<<

 hazardous waste contains mainly of high fluoride concentration containing filter dust. The hazardous waste is mainly disposed of by authorized hazardous waste management and treatment companies. Non-hazardous waste is either disposed of at

<<<

 our own landfills or by contracted waste management companies. We are responsible for the environmental impacts of our operative and closed landfills. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable waste management laws and continuously

<<<

 attempt to reduce waste at our sites.
Hazardous Substances
Operators of facilities storing hazardous substances in large quantities are required to comply with safety standards set forth in Council Directive 96/82/EC on the control of major

<<<

-accident hazards involving dangerous substances (the "Seveso II Directive") and the respective national implementing law. The Seveso II Directive has been implemented into national legislation by the Finnish Hazardous Chemicals and Explosives

<<<

 Safety Act (390/2005, Laki vaarallisten kemikaalien ja rajahteiden kasittelyn turvallisuudesta). The Finnish Safety and Chemicals Agency (TUKES) considers our facilities in Oulu and Parainen to be Seveso II Directive facilities. This means

<<<

 that the municipal authority for planning and building is required to take the facilities into consideration when drafting land use plans and granting building permits in the vicinity of the facilities. The Seveso II Directive will be amended

<<<

 and replaced by Directive 2012/18/EU ("Seveso III Directive"), which must be transposed and implemented into national law by Member States by June 2015.
In Finland, the handling and storage of hazardous substances might be subject to an environmental

<<<

 permit if such activities pose a threat of environmental pollution in accordance with the Finnish Environmental Protection Act. The storage and handling of hazardous substances is also regulated by the Finnish Hazardous Chemicals and Explosives

<<<

 Safety Act, which aims to prevent damages caused by the production, usage, transfer, storage and other handling of hazardous chemicals and explosives. The industrial processing and storage of hazardous chemicals on a large scale is subject

<<<

 to a permit granted by TUKES. In this case the operator is also required to prepare an internal emergency plan. If the industrial processing and storage of hazardous chemicals is on a smaller scale, the operator is still required to notify

<<<

 TUKES of its activities. Prevention of industrial accidents is regulated under the Finnish Environmental Protection Act. The environmental permit authority is obligated to include adequate permit conditions regarding the prevention of accidents

<<<

 and the limitation of their consequences. These permit conditions usually include obligations to submit adequate safety plans for exceptional situations such as accidents.
At our sites and facilities, we frequently handle and use hazardous

<<<

 substances. Explosive materials may be used for blasting in connection with the extraction of raw materials in our quarries. Although we believe that our operations are in material compliance with safety requirements, findings of insufficient

<<<

 protection against spills and uncontrolled release of substances could result in capital expenditures for technical improvements or maintenance to ensure future compliance.
145

Excavation of Stone Resources
In Finland, the excavation of stone

<<<

 resources is subject to the Mining Act (621/2011, Kaivoslaki), which governs the extraction and exploitation of mining minerals. Mining minerals include metal minerals, industrial minerals, marble and soapstone. The minerals extracted to make

<<<

 stone wool are considered to be industrial minerals, but may also contain certain metal minerals. Industrial scale exploration and extraction of mining minerals may only be carried out pursuant to various mining rights.
Title to minerals is

<<<

 obtained through a claim system where the first applicant of a mining right receives a priority over later applications in respect of the deposit in question. All mining right applications are handled on a first-come, first-served basis and

<<<

 the Finnish State does not have discretion in respect of the applicant or its perceived capability (compared to others) to carry out exploration or mining activities. The extent of actions that can be taken based on each different mining right

<<<

 varies, but the extraction of mining minerals is only possible based on a mining permit (the permits granted to companies based on applications made prior to July 1, 2011 are called "mining district decisions") and the stipulations provided

<<<

 therein. The permit enables the permit holder to exploit the minerals found within the mining permit area as well as the by-products obtained in connection with mining (overburden, waste rock and tailings). The exploitation also requires that

<<<

 the holder of the mining permit secures the necessary surface rights for such exploitation. The surface rights may either be purchased or leased from private landowners or alternatively the right to use the land can be expropriated in connection

<<<

 with the permitting process. However, expropriation in connection with mining permit applications filed on or after July 1, 2011 requires a permit from the Council of State (Cabinet). Mining district decisions are valid until further notice

<<<

, although the review of permit stipulations is done at regular intervals. Mining permits can be awarded for a fixed time (e.g., if the resource is limited) but are as a general rule awarded until further notice.
All mining operations are subject

<<<

 to the requirements in the Finnish Environmental Protection Act. Mining is possible only if the relevant operator company is awarded an environmental permit for its operations. Further, other required permits include, for example, a mining

<<<

 safety permit. The drainage of the mining area and the right to take water from bodies of water are subject to permitting procedures in the Water Act (587/2011, Vesilaki). Building all relevant road connections, as well as intersections, requires

<<<

 specific permits from the transportation authorities. Chemicals usage requires its own permits from TUKES.
Such permits may be subject to stringent requirements to ensure an environmentally sound excavation process in compliance with environmental

<<<

 laws. Operational permits such as land extraction permits, mining permits and environmental permits typically require remediation, recultivation and renaturation of the mining areas after excavation of raw materials, and operators are obliged

<<<

 to bear any cost in connection with such obligations including the post-closure monitoring of the closed sites. Moreover, under Finnish tort law, the operator of a permitted quarrying operation may be held liable for damage resulting from such

<<<

 operations to third parties if the causality between the operations and the damage is probable. In the Finnish context liability is limited to full compensation for all damage caused (i.e., punitive damages are not awarded) including economic

<<<

 damage, if such damage is not insignificant.
Mining permits expire when the operations end. If the permit holder has not initiated mining activity or such preparatory work which indicates that the permit holder is seriously intending to conduct

<<<

 mining operations, the Mining Authority may terminate the permit. If the operations have been suspended for a minimum of five years or if the mining operations are considered to have actually ended, the Mining Authority may terminate the permit

<<<

.
The Mining Authority may within its discretion, under certain circumstances, choose not to terminate a mining permit due to inactivity of the operator. In these cases the mining authority may delay the expiry of the permit for two years at

<<<

 a time up to a total of 10 years. During this time, the permit holder has the obligation to pay an increased excavation fee. The increased annual fee is 100 per hectare for the duration of the delay.
Raw materials used in the production of

<<<

 stone wool are excavated from mining areas (quarries and pits) by surface mining. Closure obligations of mining areas are subject to regulations governing remediation, recultivation and renaturation obligations. Expected costs for the closure

<<<

 of quarries and pits are covered by accounting provisions. Moreover, the Finnish Environmental Protection Act (86/2000, Ympristnsuojelulaki) provides that we must provide security over our waste management obligations related to our mining

<<<

 operations. The amount of the security for the waste areas varies depending on the quality and quantity of the waste rock in question. Typically the security is euros per square meter of waste rock area used. The amount per square meter in

<<<

 practice currently varies from 0.4/m2 (inert waste rock) to 30/m2 (hazardous waste landfills).
Furthermore, the Mining Act requires that we also provide collateral to secure our obligations related to the closure of the mining area. Under the

<<<

 Mining Act this collateral may be in the form of an unencumbered bank deposit, bank guarantee, insurance guarantee, group guarantee or other similar
146

commitment or right, though the form and amount to be provided in any particular case

<<<

 is subject to determination by the Mining Authority in a pending administrative decision to amend our mining district decisions. These obligations include, among other actions, tidying up the area, landscaping, refurbishing the area to meet

<<<

 public safety criteria, removing extracted minerals and buildings and equipment, as well as other obligations provided for in the mining permit. The obligation as regards the security was introduced in the 2011 mining legislation reform and

<<<

 the transitional period ends at the end of June 2014. The Mining Authority has accepted our proposal that we provide a three-year bank guarantee in the amount of 50,000 to cover all of our mining districts.
We are not subject to statutory royalties

<<<

. However, we have an obligation to pay fees to the landowners of the area covered by our mining permits. No such fees have to be paid in respect of those properties which we own within the mining area. With respect to payments regarding mining

<<<

 permits, the landowners of a mine site are entitled to an extraction fee, which must be paid annually. The fee consists of two parts: one part is a land area based fee (50 per hectare) and the other part is a variable fee, which is based on

<<<

 the amount of the extracted minerals and the reasonable value thereof. The latter part of the extraction fee is paid only once mining is commenced. Futhermore, we may be required to pay a byproduct fee, if such byproducts are sold by us for

<<<

 use outside the mining operations. The by-product fee must be reasonable and based on the value of the byproducts. The variable fee is either agreed with the landowners or the authority responsible for granting mining rights makes a decision

<<<

 on reasonable compensation for the extracted minerals, taking into account the factors affecting the value of such extracted minerals.
Under Finnish law we are not subject to any legal requirements as regards the classification of deposits

<<<

. The Finnish association of extractive resources industry recommends that mining companies use the Fennoscandian review board's standards of disclosure for mineral projects when they make reports of their mineral projects. The standards are

<<<

 based on the Canadian NI 43-101. However, most mining companies use the reporting standards which are typically employed in the jurisdictions where the companies are listed or systems for which their personnel have accreditation.
Health and

<<<

 Safety
In all of the jurisdictions in which we operate we must comply with applicable laws and regulations to protect employees against occupational injuries. Under such laws and regulations, employers typically must establish working conditions

<<<

 that effectively prevent dangers to employees. In particular, employers must observe certain medical and hygienic standards and comply with certain occupational health and safety requirements, such as permissible maximum levels for noise in

<<<

 the workplace, the use of personal protective equipment and requirements relating to maximum temperatures and air ventilation.
Corresponding requirements are found in the Finnish Occupational Safety and Health regulation. Our operations in

<<<

 Finland are regulated by the safety requirements set out in the Finnish Occupational Safety and Health Act (738/2002, Tyoturvallisuuslaki). As employers we are required to take care of the safety and health of our employees. As the employer

<<<

 we have a duty to establish an occupational safety and health policy in order to promote safety and health issues. We are also required to assess the hazards and risk factors caused by the work, the premises and other working conditions and

<<<

 eliminate such risks. In order to comply with the applicable requirements, we regularly conduct training and medical examinations and implement and monitor safety measures. If we detect any unsafe condition in one of our sites, local management

<<<

 is authorized to act without further permission, up to certain defined expenditure limits.
Asbestos Containing Material (ACM)
In Finland, the use of asbestos containing materials ("ACMs") was partly prohibited in 1977 and completely banned

<<<

 in 1994 due to the negative health effects associated with asbestos dust. Asbestos containing articles are prohibited in general by the EU REACH regulation (No 1907/2006). There are some exceptions from the general prohibition regarding, among

<<<

 others, existing building structures and parts of structures containing asbestos, which are permitted until they are disposed of or reach the end of their service life. Hence, in Finland, there is no explicit legal obligation to remove ACMs

<<<

 in structures unless their condition and presence is such that the ACMs are considered to be hazardous to health. Currently, ACMs are not considered to constitute a health risk when found in intact materials which are in normal use. Modification

<<<

 and demolition work of ACMs include special obligations on safety as regulated by law.
We are aware that ACMs exist at some or all of our Finnish sites, especially in our older facilities and structures. We are not aware of any enquiries by

<<<

 the occupational safety and health authorities relating to any asbestos issues at the Finnish facilities, and our internal policy in Finland is that an asbestos assessment is performed before any modification or renovation work is undertaken

<<<

 at the facilities. During the closure of our Lappeenranta site, special asbestos demolition work might be required due to ACMs, which is likely
147

to cause additional demolition costs. We may be subject to similar demolition or abatement

<<<

 costs in connection with closure or construction activities at our sites in the future.
We have not been engaged in any manufacturing or other operational business activities regarding products containing asbestos, but products containing asbestos

<<<

 have historically been manufactured at the Finnish sites by earlier operators, including the former owner of a business we acquired through a business transfer in 1998. In Finland, the Product Liability Act (696/1990, Tuoteturvallisuuslaki

<<<

) sets out strict liability (i.e., liability without regard to fault) for products manufactured on or after the Product Liability Act entered into force on September 1, 1991. However, liability for damages caused by products before the Product

<<<

 Liability Act entered into force would generally require culpability (intent or negligence). The asbestos containing products were manufactured before asbestos prohibitions were introduced and before the enactment of the Product Liability Act

<<<

. We are not aware of any claims for compensation regarding liability for asbestos containing products produced by preceding entities.
In addition, asbestos related diseases incurred by employees are compensated by Statutory Worker's Compensation

<<<

 Insurance. An employee may claim damages only for the amount of lost salary and other damages that are not covered by the insurance. Pursuant to the Act on the Finnish National Register on Occupational Exposure to Carcinogens (717/2001, Laki

<<<

 syopasairauden vaaraa aiheuttaville aineille ja menetelmille ammatissaan altistuvien rekisterista) the employer is responsible for notifying the Finnish National Register on Occupational Exposure to Carcinogens, which was established in 19

<<<

79, of employees that have been exposed to certain substances, such as asbestos. A small number of current and former employees of the Finnish Group companies and their predecessor entities, including five of our current employees, have probably

<<<

 worked in the past under circumstances that exposed them to asbestos containing materials associated with the activities conducted by certain of our predecessor entities. However, none of our employees are registered on the register in question

<<<

. Discussions regarding this matter are ongoing with the Finnish Occupational Safety and Health Administration. We currently intend to file a notification with the Finnish Occupational Safety and Health Administration's National Register of

<<<

 the relevant current employees, and those former employees of our predecessor entities that probably worked in the past (but only since 1979) under circumstances that exposed them to asbestos containing materials. The Finnish Occupational Safety

<<<

 and Health Administration is already, based on our earlier communications, aware of this matter in relation to the five current employees. No claims by such employees, insurers or other parties have to date been made or threatened under the

<<<

 Statutory Worker's Compensation Insurance scheme or otherwise, and we do not currently anticipate any such claims.
Regulation of Chemicals
The European Union requires control of the use of chemical products within the European Union, requiring

<<<

 all affected industries to ensure and demonstrate the safe manufacture, use and disposal of chemicals. The Regulation (EC) No. 1907/2006 on Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals ("REACH"), which came into force

<<<

 in 2007, requires the registration of all chemicals manufactured in, or imported into, the EU in quantities of more than one tonne per annum with the European Chemicals Agency ("ECHA"). The import or manufacture of certain so-called highly

<<<

 hazardous chemicals must be authorized by ECHA. REACH requires formal documentation of the relevant data required for hazard assessments for each substance registered as well as development of risk assessments for their registered uses. Under

<<<

 certain circumstances, the performance of a chemical safety assessment is mandatory and a chemical safety report ("CSR") assuring the safe use of the substance must be submitted. If there is no pre-registration of a substance, it is impermissible

<<<

 to produce such chemical in the EU or to import it (i.e., "no data no market'' principle). Therefore, registration is vital for the future use of any substance used in technically important processes by manufacturers or importers. The data

<<<

 by importers or manufacturers is collected in substance information exchange forums ("SlEF"), to allow a vital exchange among producers and users of chemicals. Therefore, purchasers of registered chemicals must inform their sellers about the

<<<

 intended use of the chemicals, as the importer or producer must add this information to its documentation.
Furthermore, REACH contains prohibitions on bringing substances to market that have been identified as substances of very high concern

<<<

. If necessary, raw materials or their manufactured substances will be listed on the so-called candidate list or on Annex XIV to REACH which may mean a full ban or requirement for authorization, which may or may not be granted by the European

<<<

 Commission. In addition, REACH was accompanied by legislation providing for a comprehensive system on the classification, labeling and packaging of substances and mixtures (CLP Regulation and related European legislation).
We produce considerable

<<<

 quantities of loose wool, slabs, mats, rolls, bats, etc., which contain substances that are subject REACH. We believe that we have fulfilled our obligations under the relevant SIEF of the ECHA. Our registrations have been finalized on time

<<<

 and their completeness has been confirmed by ECHA. None of our products is affected by substances of very high concern.
148

National regulations on chemicals may impose further obligations on producers, processors and handlers of chemical

<<<

 agents. We are subject to various notification and labeling requirements and have to comply with certain safety obligations arising, for example, under the Finnish Chemicals Act (599/2013, Kemikaalilaki) and the Finnish Chemicals Safety Act

<<<

 (390/2005, Laki vaarallisten kemikaalien ja rajahteiden kdsittelyn turvallisuudesta), which mainly reflects and accompanies REACH at the national level, but also establishes national requirements.
Technical Approvals for Construction Products

<<<


As we manufacture building materials, the regulation on constructions products is relevant to our activities. In Finland, the manufacture and sale of construction materials is subject to technical regulations and approval requirements.
To establish

<<<

 that particular construction materials conform to the relevant technical approvals, in many jurisdictions manufacturers must implement and document a factory production control system. Moreover, applicable law may require an initial type testing

<<<

 of the construction product to be performed by an authorized body. In addition, applicable law frequently requires that the competent organization maintain a continuous surveillance, assessment and approval of the construction products. If

<<<

 construction materials that do not comply with applicable regulations have been used in a building, applicable law in many jurisdictions may require such buildings to be upgraded, reconstructed or even demolished.
The European Construction

<<<

 Products Regulation (No 305/2011) (the ``EU Construction Regulation") provides the EU-level framework for the approvals and unified criteria for construction products. The fact that a product fulfills these criteria is shown through the ``CE

<<<

'' marking, which became obligatory for most construction products in 2013 through the new EU Construction Regulation. All products that belong under a harmonized European standard ("hEN") adopted by the European Committee for Standardization

<<<

 must be CE marked for commercialization. For example, there are harmonized European standards regarding mineral wool products. The European NLF Regulation (Decision 768/2008/EC on a common framework for the marketing of products) forms the

<<<

 general basis for the legislation governing the CE marking. The Finnish municipal building supervision authority monitors the use of CE-marked building materials in Finland and reports possible flaws to TUKES that acts as the market surveillance

<<<

 authority in accordance with the European Construction Products Regulation.
The EU Construction Regulation also has provisions on the granting of European technical assessments (``ETAs") for construction materials that are not under a harmonized

<<<

 European standard, in order to allow them to be distributed within the EU with the CE marking. Acquiring an ETA for a product is voluntary. The basic requirements of construction products listed in the EU Construction Regulation form a basis

<<<

 for the drafting of both harmonized European standards and ETAs. The technical assessment body granting ETAs in Finland is VTT Expert Services Ltd.
In addition to assessment mechanisms for construction materials based on ETAs, other approval

<<<

 mechanisms are also in use in Finland. There is a national approval procedure for construction products which are not under any harmonized product standard and which do not have ETA and thus cannot be CE marked. The purpose of the national

<<<

 approval procedure is to determine whether a product fulfills the substantial technical requirements imposed on construction products by the Finnish Land Use and Building Act (the ``LBA", 132/1999). The procedure is governed by the Finnish

<<<

 Act on the Product Approval of Certain Construction Products (954/2012) and by the related Decree (555/2013). The acceptability of construction products can be verified by VTT Expert Services Ltd, by way of either type approval, verification

<<<

 certificate or manufacture quality control, depending on the product. These procedures are voluntary, but if no verification procedure has been conducted, the municipal building supervision authority may require verification for the construction

<<<

 materials used on a construction site.
Most of our construction products are under harmonized product standards and are hence CE marked. Some of our products are certified in the Finnish procedure. We believe that we are in material compliance

<<<

 with applicable EU and Finnish legislation on construction materials.
Climate Change Law
General
In many regions in which we operate, a constantly developing body of law and regulatory requirements addresses the challenges of global climate

<<<

 change. The primary objectives of climate change regulation are the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, higher efficiency in the use of energy from conventional
149

sources and the increasing use of energy from renewable sources. In the

<<<

 EU, regulations attempt to both reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to establish a mechanism for trading in carbon dioxide emission certificates.
Emission Trading Law in the European Union
The EU has, through the Emission Trading Directive

<<<

 2003/87/EC, launched the European Union Emission Trading System ("EU ETS") for certain greenhouse gas emissions in order to fulfill its greenhouse emission reduction targets. The EU ETS was partly established to ensure that the emission reduction

<<<

 commitments set under the Kyoto protocol were met during Phase II of the ETS. The EU ETS involves a trading system for emission allowances based on a cap-and-trade system. Industrial sites to which the EU ETS applies receive a certain number

<<<

 of emissions allowances to emit greenhouse gases and must surrender one allowance for each tonne of CO2, the main greenhouse gas, or the CO2 equivalent amount of another greenhouse gas emitted. Sites that emit fewer tonnes of greenhouse gases

<<<

 than their allocated emissions allowances are allowed to sell their excess allowances in the open market, and sites that emit more than their allocated emissions allowances are required to buy additional allowances through the EU ETS. Participation

<<<

 in this system has been mandatory since 2005 for industries with high energy consumption levels.
For the second trading period under the ETS (2008 through 2012), national allocation plans were implemented in all Member States. The total volume

<<<

 of emission allowances was reduced by 6.5% for the second period compared with the 2005 level. In addition, the overall availability of emission allowances allocated free of charge during the second trading period was reduced. However, due

<<<

 to the recent economic downturn, emissions were reduced, and demand for allowances was also reduced. This led to a surplus of unused allowances, which affected the carbon price throughout the second trading period.
The EU ETS has been further

<<<

 revised for the third trading period that began in January 2013. Under the revised EU ETS, the EU-wide quantity of emission allowances allocated each year will be reduced by a linear factor of 1.74% of the average total quantity of allowances

<<<

 issued annually in 2008-2012 as adjusted due to the change in scope of the scheme as of 2013.
The full auctioning of emissions is undertaken progressively for the manufacturing industry. The quantities of emission allowances allocated free

<<<

 of charge will generally be reduced from 80% in 2013 to 30% in 2020 and to 0% in 2027. As a result, affected companies whose emissions exceed their emission allowances will from 2013 onwards have to purchase a significant, and steadily increasing

<<<

, share of emission allowances in auctions or otherwise from the market, which will result in substantial additional cost for such companies. The amount of emission allowances allocated free of charge for each installation will be determined

<<<

, in part, by an adjusting factor (a so-called ``benchmark value'') that will be based on the 10% most energyefficient installations in the particular industry.
Finland is a party to the Kyoto Protocol both individually and as a part of the

<<<

 EU. As a member of the EU, Finland has implemented the Emissions Trading Directive through the Finnish Emissions Trading Act (311/2011, Pddstokauppalaki), which means that most sectors of heavy industry are subject to the EU ETS. About 600

<<<

 facilities in Finland are currently subject to the EU ETS. Due to amendment of the Emission Trading Directive in 2009, mineral wool insulation material producing facilities using glass, rock or slag with a melting capacity exceeding 20 tonnes

<<<

 per day was included in the activities subject to the EU ETS. A corresponding amendment was added to the Finnish Emissions Trading Act. The amendments entered into force in 2013 and apply to the third emissions trading period. The Finnish Energy

<<<

 Authority (Energiavirasto) is responsible for maintaining a register that controls the registration, ownership, transferring and annulment of allowances in Finland. A facility that is subject to the EU ETS is required to apply for an emissions

<<<

 permit from the Finnish Energy Authority to be allowed to emit greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.
Our base operations in Parainen and our operations in Lappeenranta and Oulu are subject to the EU ETS. Our panel system operations in Parainen

<<<

 are not subject to the EU ETS because the thermal output power of the site's boiler does not exceed 20 MW. The sites in Parainen and Lappeenranta began to participate in the EU ETS during the second ETS period from 2008 to 2012 as combustion

<<<

 plants (thermal output more than 20 MW). Since the beginning of the third ETS period (2013-2020), production of mineral wool from rock has been included as an industry in the EU ETS if the melting capacity is at least 20 tonnes per day. The

<<<

 base operations in Parainen and our operations in Lappeenranta and Oulu are also considered subject to the EU ETS in accordance with this provision. Correspondingly, we have been granted three emissions permits by the Finnish Energy Authority

<<<

.
150

In order to address the competitiveness of industries subject to the EU ETS, certain energy-intensive industries which are exposed to a significant risk of relocation of plants to countries with less stringent climate protection laws

<<<

 (a phenomenon known as ``carbon leakage'') will receive more free allowances. The European Commission will determine every five years which industries are threatened by carbon leakage. The designated industries will be allocated emission allowances

<<<

 free of charge for the period determined. The quantity of emission allowances allocated for free is determined based on certain benchmarks. These benchmarks are set in accordance with the most efficient production methods in a particular industry

<<<

. The next determination on the carbon leakage status by the European Commission will be made in 2014 and apply from 2015 to 2019.
Our mineral wool production operations fall under the European Parliament and Council decision (2010/2/EU) determining

<<<

 a list of sectors and subsectors which are deemed to be exposed to a significant risk of carbon leakage. The sites have therefore been entitled to receive free allowances. The first carbon leakage list was adopted in 2009 and is applicable

<<<

 for the free allocation of allowances in 2013 and 2014. Although the mineral wool sector has again been specified as a sector deemed to be exposed to a significant risk of carbon leakage in the draft European Commission decision published on

<<<

 May 5, 2014 regarding the 2015-2019 carbon leakage list, there is no guarantee that the sector will be included in the list ultimately adopted by the European Commission following scrutiny by the EU Climate Change Committee, the European Parliament

<<<

 and the Council. There is also no certainty that the mineral wool sector will be considered to be threatened by carbon leakage at the time of any subsequent revision of the carbon leakage list. If the European Commission held that no such threat

<<<

 of carbon leakage exists in 2014 or at the time of any later revision, the regular emissions reduction scheme would also apply to our facilities. The allocation of free emissions allowances would be reduced from 80% in 2013 to 30% in 2020 on

<<<

 a linear basis. In this case, our mineral wool business would be required to participate in the auctioning system and purchase emission allowances in the amount required for production purposes, which could result in material cost to us.
On

<<<

 February 27, 2014, the Commission Regulation No 176/2014 amending Regulation No 1031/2010 entered into force. The new regulation altered the previously determined volumes of emissions allowances to be auctioned in 2013-20. In accordance with

<<<

 the new regulation, the Commission is postponing the auctioning of 900 million emissions allowances from 2014 to 2016 until 2019-2020 to allow the demand to pick up ("Back-loading"). The Back-loading does not affect the overall volume of emissions

<<<

 allowances to be auctioned in the third trading period--it only affects the distribution of auction volumes over the period. In accordance with the new regulation, allowances are reduced by 400 million in 2014, 300 million in 2015 and 200 million

<<<

 in 2016. Emissions allowances to be auctioned are correspondingly increased by 300 million in 2019 and 600 million in 2020.
All of our Finnish sites subject to the EU ETS have been granted the appropriate emissions permits by the Finnish Energy

<<<

 Authority and the required monitoring of emissions has been appropriately conducted and reported to the relevant authorities. We believe that we are in compliance with the emissions trading legislation. We may, however, be required to incur

<<<

 significant capital expenditures to upgrade our facilities in the future to comply with the maximum emission levels. The price trend of emission allowances may also have a significant adverse effect on our business.
Energy efficiency regulations

<<<


The EU has also adopted directives regulating the energy efficiency of buildings, for example, the EU Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency and the EU Directive 2010/31/EU on the energy performance of buildings. The Energy Efficiency Directive

<<<

 (the ``EED") targets a 20% increase in energy efficiency by 2020. The EED entered into force in December 2012, and obliges Member States to set national energy efficiency targets and report any progress achieved towards these targets to the

<<<

 European Commission by April 30 of each year. Alternatively, under the EED Member States may opt to take other policy measures to achieve energy savings among final customers, provided that the amount of such savings is equivalent to the amount

<<<

 of new energy savings required by the energy efficiency obligation scheme option. New energy efficient goals for 2030, which are likely to be in excess of the present 20% reduction target, are also currently under review by the European Commission

<<<

. The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (the ``EPBD") instructs Member States to set minimum standards for energy efficiency in new and renovated buildings, which must be quantifiable and subject to a specified calculation methodology

<<<

 which takes into account multiple factors that influence energy use (e.g., thermal characteristics of the building, heating installation and hot water supply). However the EPBD does not specify what the specific performance standards should

<<<

 be. Detailed performance requirements are set at a national level, within the confines of
151

certain EU guidelines, such as the requirement that all new buildings must be "near zero energy buildings'' by 2020.
The Finnish Land Use and Building

<<<

 Act (the "LBA", 132/1999) implements the requirements set out in the latter Directive by providing that new buildings must fulfill the minimum energy efficiency requirements set out in the Finnish Building Regulations adopted by the Ministry

<<<

 of the Environment. Accordingly, construction developers must choose their construction materials with energy efficiency in mind. The same applies to repair constructions. The new energy efficiency regulation might have a favorable effect on

<<<

 the demand for our heat-insulating products.
Sweden
In Sweden, we are primarily subject to the provisions in the Swedish Environmental Code (Sw. miljbalken 1998:808) and related ordinances and regulations, for example, the Environmental Proceedings

<<<

 Ordinance (Sw. Miljprvningsfrrdningen 2013:251). See "--Finland'' above for information on European-wide regulations. The Swedish Environmental Code includes provisions regarding matters such as environmental permits, environmental liability

<<<

 and handling of chemicals and waste.
Soil and Groundwater Contamination
In Sweden, the person who carries out an activity which causes contamination (the "peratr") is primarily liable for remedial actions, i.e. investigations and remediation

<<<

. If contamination was caused by several operators, they are jointly and severally liable and the supervisory authorities are free to request remediation from any of the liable operators. If no operator can be made liable, the purchaser of real

<<<

 property may be liable if she/he knew or should have known about the contamination at the time of the acquisition and the purchase was made after December 31, 1998. Regardless of the owner's liability regarding remediation, the owner of the

<<<

 real property may be liable for the part of the costs for the remediation which are proportionate to the increase in value of the real property after remediation is carried out. The liability for contamination in Sweden is not limited in time

<<<

. Although we believe that we are generally in compliance with our legal obligations at our Swedish sites, groundwater contamination has been detected at our Hssleholm site, and additional contamination of soil and groundwater may be discovered

<<<

 at these or other sites in the future. Such discovery of previously unknown contamination, or the imposition of new obligations to investigate or remediate soil or groundwater contamination, could have a material adverse effect on our business

<<<

, financial condition or results of operation.
In Sweden, the IED Directive primarily was implemented through the Industrial Emissions Ordinance (Sw. Industriutslppsfrrdningen 2013:250). Our Hllekis and Hssleholm facilities in Sweden will

<<<

 be required to conduct baseline studies to evaluate soil and groundwater contamination by 2016 or in connection will the application for an environmental permit application or an amendment to an existing permit. We believe that our Hssleholm

<<<

 site will need to make IED improvements.
Emissions and Environmental Permits
In Sweden, an operational permit is issued pursuant to the Swedish Environmental Code (Sw. miljbalken 1998:808). Such permit includes both production limits and precautionary

<<<

 conditions, for example, regarding emissions to air and water as well as the handling of waste and chemicals. Normally, a permit issued pursuant to the Swedish Environmental Code is not limited in time. However, the Swedish Environmental Code

<<<

 contains provisions which establish a possibility for the permitting or supervisory authorities to request withdrawal or updates of valid environmental permits. Our Hassleholm plant is expected to renew its environmental permit by the end

<<<

 of 2014. Non-compliance with a permit condition issued pursuant to the Swedish Environmental Code may result in a penalty or imprisonment. A new or amended permit must be applied for if the stipulated production limits are planned to be exceeded

<<<

. New or amended environmental permits are likely to include more stringent permit conditions.
In Sweden, the emission limits stipulated pursuant to the provisions in the IED Directive will not adjust the existing permit provisions, but will

<<<

 apply to the operations in parallel with existing environmental permit conditions. We believe that our Hassleholm site will need to make IED improvements in order to comply with BAT standards, which may require significant capital expenditures

<<<

.
152

Waste
In Sweden, the handling of waste is primarily regulated by the Swedish Environmental Code and the Waste Ordinance (Sw. avfallsfrordningen 2011:927). However, as regards an operation required to hold an environmental permit, parts

<<<

 of the waste management of such an operation are often governed by conditions regarding waste handling contained in the environmental permit. The Swedish Environmental Code and the Waste Ordinance also includes specific relevant provisions

<<<

 regarding sorting, transport, handling of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, and documentation.
Hazardous Substances
In Sweden, specific permits to handle inflammable and explosive goods must be obtained pursuant to the Inflammable and Explosive

<<<

 Goods Act (Sw. lag om brandfarliga och explosiva varor 2010:1011). Such permits are always limited in time.
Health and Safety
The primary pieces of legislation relating to health and safety are the Swedish Work Environment Act (Sw. arbetsmiljlagen

<<<

 1977:1160), the Swedish Work Environment Ordinance (Sw. arbetsmiljfrordningen 1977:1166) and regulations from the Swedish Work Environment Authority (Sw. arbetsmiljverket). An employer has, as a starting point, a duty to implement systematic

<<<

 work environment management procedures, including, for example, processes for the assessment of risk and taking of preventive measures. In addition, there are several detailed regulations relating to health and safety, including obligations

<<<

 imposed on the employer regarding the workers' environment.
Regulation of Chemicals
In addition to REACH, Swedish legislation includes provisions regarding the use and handling of chemicals, such as those in Chapter 14 of the Swedish Environmental

<<<

 Code and regulations from the Swedish Chemical Inspectorate (Sw. kemikalieinspektionen). Moreover, Chapter 2, Section 4 of the Swedish Environmental Code provides that persons who pursue an activity or take a measure, or intend to do so, shall

<<<

 avoid using or selling chemical products or biotechnical organisms that may involve risks to human health or the environment if products or organisms that are assumed to be less dangerous can be used instead.
Technical Approvals for Construction

<<<

 Products
The EU Construction Regulation, discussed in "--Finland'' above, also applies to the Swedish market.
Emission Trading Law in the European Union
In Sweden, the EU ETS has been primarily implemented by the Trading of Emission Allowances

<<<

 Act (Sw. lag om handel med utslppsrtter 2004:1199).
Our operations in Hllekis and our operations in Hssleholm are subject to the EU ETS (our operations at Skvde are not subject to the EU ETS). The site in Hllekis have participated in

<<<

 the EU ETS during the second EU ETS period from 2009 to 2012 as a combustion plants (thermal output more than 20 MW). Since the beginning of the third EU ETS period (2013-2020) production of mineral wool from rock has been included as an industry

<<<

 in the EU ETS if the melting capacity is at least 20 tons per day. The site in Hassleholm is also subject to the EU ETS in accordance with this provision. According to the decision allocating emission rights in Sweden, the site in Hllekis

<<<

 will be provided with 38,544 tonnes of free allowances for 2014. The free allowances will decrease in subsequent years, and in 2020 34,302 tonnes of free allowances will be allocated to the Hallekis facility. A similar decrease has been determined

<<<

 for the Hssleholm facility. According to the decision, the site in Hssleholm will be provided with 22,106 tonnes of free allowances for 2014, but not more than 19,081 tonnes for 2020.
Energy efficiency regulations
The EU directives on energy

<<<

 efficiency discussed in "--Finland'' above are proposed to be implemented in several pieces of legislation in Sweden, including, for example, the Energy Mapping in Lagre Corporation Act (Sw. lag om energikartlggning i stora fretag) and the

<<<

 Energy Measurement in Buildings Act (Sw. lag om energimtning I byggnader). The necessary legislation is propsed to enter into force June 1, 2014.
153

Lithuania
Our Lithuanian facilities are subject to extensive environmental regulation.

<<<

 The permit requirements on air emissions, water discharges and pollution control regarding our operations in Lithuania are based on Lithuanian and EU legislation. See "--Finland'' above for information on European-wide regulations.
Soil and

<<<

 Groundwater Contamination
Operations in Lithuania that produce emissions into the environment, including surface water, are regulated by the Lithuanian Environmental Protection Act (I-2223, Aplinkos apsaugos istatymas), Water Act (VIII-474

<<<

, Vandens istatymas), Drinking Water Supply and Waste Water Management Act (X-764, Geriamojo vandens tiekimo ir nuoteku tvarkymo istatymas) and Act on Subsoil Resources (I-1034, Zemes gelmiu istatymas). Such operations are subject to an environmental

<<<

 permit. In accordance with the Water Act, the operations that may change or alter bodies of water and wetlands as well as water level require an environmental impact assessment in accordance with requirements defined by the Order of the Minister

<<<

 of Environment.
When using water resources and bodies of water directly for industrial and economic purposes, the operator is required to observe thresholds set for the use of water and technological norms and rules and conditions aimed at

<<<

 avoiding waste water pollution. The operator must also implement measures intended to reduce water use and the pollution of waste water, to improve production technologies, water supply and waste water treatment systems as well as implement

<<<

 recycling water supply systems.
The aforementioned laws also regulate the use of water areas for waste water discharge. Waste water must be collected and treated using the best available technology and discharged so that will have a minimal

<<<

 impact on the environment. The rules on the conditions for waste water discharge and granting of permits are regulated by an order of the Minister of Environment. Waste water discharge to surface water is permitted if it is not in contradiction

<<<

 with environmental protection purposes set out in the Water Act. It is prohibited to directly discharge waste water to groundwater, underground cavities and sinkholes. Waste water can be discharged to soil under the rules set out by an order

<<<

 of the Minister of Environment.
Responsibility for contamination of soil and groundwater is based on the Lithuanian Environmental Protection Act and is imposed by the environmental authorities. State authorities have the right to, among other

<<<

 things, restrict the activities of legal and natural persons or impose administrative penalties thereon, where laws on environmental protection are being violated or where such activities do not comply with the normative standards, rules, limits

<<<

 and other conditions established in respect of environmental protection. Adverse effects to the environment resulting from economic activities may lead to civil or administrative responsibility, including compulsory remediation obligations

<<<

. Entities performing economic activities may be subject to civil liability irrespective of their culpability for any environmental damage or any imminent threat thereof resulting from their economic activities, except as otherwise provided

<<<

 by Lithuanian Environmental Protection Act.
Entities performing economic activities must take all necessary measures to prevent damage to the environment, human health and life, or the property and interests of other persons. Persons guilty

<<<

 of causing such damage to the environment must, where possible, restore the state of the environment to its undamaged (or "baseline") condition, and compensate for all losses. This baseline condition is determined on the basis of the information

<<<

 available on the state of the environment before the relevant damage was caused. The state of the environment must be restored by rehabilitating the damaged environment, or elements or impaired functions thereof. In the event of land damage

<<<

 (either surface or underground), any threat of adverse effects on human health must be eliminated. Environmental damage is assessed and calculated according to the methods approved by the Minister of Environment, having regard to the baseline

<<<

 condition, the significance of the adverse effect on the environment, and the possibility and likely duration of natural restoration of the environment.
If there is an imminent threat of environmental damage, an entity must, without delay,

<<<

 take all necessary preventive measures. Where the imminent threat of environmental damage is not dispelled, despite the preventive measures taken by the entity, the entity must forthwith inform the Ministry of Environment or an institution

<<<

 authorized by it.
Where environmental damage has occurred, the economic entity must, without delay, notify the Ministry of Environment or an institution authorized by it and take all the necessary actions to immediately control, contain, remove

<<<

, remediate or otherwise manage contaminants and/or other causes of damage in order to limit or prevent further environmental damage and adverse effects on human health. The entire cost of
154

preventive and/or remedial measures shall be borne

<<<

 by the entity which has caused environmental damage or the imminent threat thereof, including where the appropriate measures have been implemented by institutions authorized by a municipality or the State (on their own account or with the help

<<<

 of third parties).
The entity shall not be required to bear the cost of preventive and/or remedial measures solely in the case when environmental damage or an imminent threat thereof occurred due to force majeure, where it proves that environmental

<<<

 damage or imminent threat was caused by the acts or omissions of a third party (despite the fact that all appropriate safety measures were in place), or resulted from strict compliance with a compulsory instruction emanating from an institution

<<<

 authorized by the law, other than an instruction consequent upon contamination or some other incident caused by the economic entity's own acts or omissions. The costs incurred by the entity in implementing preventive and/or remedial measures

<<<

 shall be compensated for in the aforementioned cases by the persons who have caused the environmental damage or, where these persons cannot be identified, by state or municipal institutions.
Emissions and Environmental Permits
Under the Lithuanian

<<<

 Environmental Protection Act, an environmental permit is required for activities that pose a threat of environmental pollution. All environmental effects of the activity are considered within the same permit procedure, regardless of the environment

<<<

 medium where the effects occur (i.e., regardless of whether soil, water or air is affected). An environmental permit may be granted if activities requiring the permit do not result in soil contamination or groundwater pollution, harm to health

<<<

 or any other significant environmental pollution or risk thereof. The rules for granting environmental permits are approved by the appropriate orders of the Minister of Environment.
The granting, amendment and revocation of integrated pollution

<<<

 prevention and control permits are regulated by the Order No. D1-528 of the Minister of Environment, dated July 15, 2013. This order regulates the integrated pollution caused by industrial activities and the prevention and control of such pollution

<<<

. The system of granting, amending and revoking IPPC permits seeks to ensure avoidance of greenhouse gas emissions, pollutants release into the air, water and soil, or, if not possible, to reduce the quantities and to prevent the generation

<<<

 of waste, and by this achieving a high level of environmental protection. The granting, amendment and revocation of pollution permits are regulated by the Order No D1-259 of the Minister of the Environment, dated March 6, 2014. The rules established

<<<

 by this Order address the planning and implementation of environmental protection measures for the extraction of water from surface water and pollution control measures provided for in the Water Act, air pollution control measures provided

<<<

 for in the Ambient Air Protection act (VIII-1392, Aplinkos oro apsaugos istatymas), waste prevention and management measures provided for in Act on Waste Management (VIII-787, Atlieku tvarkymo istatymas), climate change management measures

<<<

 provided for in the Lithuanian Act on Financial Instruments for Climate Change Management (XI-329, Klimato kaitos valdymo finansiniu instrumentu istatymas), and the implementation of other environmental protection measures.
The aforementioned

<<<

 rules are in compliance with the IED and the Emission Trading Directive 2003/87/EC. An environmental permit is granted either for a fixed period or until further notice. The environmental permit contains necessary permit conditions in order

<<<

 to ensure that the requirements for granting a permit will be met. An environmental permit usually contains threshold values for air, water and other emissions. Permit conditions regarding the prevention of pollution and emission thresholds

<<<

 are based on ``best available techniques'' ("BATs"). The IED amended the IPPC Directive to require best available techniques to control emission levels, and sets out rules on the prevention and control of pollution from industrial activities

<<<

 and includes rules aimed at reducing emissions into the air, water and land, as well as preventing the generation of waste in order to achieve a high level of overall environmental protection. The mineral industry (production of mineral fibers

<<<

), the chemical industry and the waste management industry, among others, will potentially need to make changes to their operations in order to comply with the new obligations deriving from the IED.
Member States were required to implement the

<<<

 IED through national legislation by January 7, 2013. In Lithuania, the IED was implemented through amendments of the Lithuanian Environmental Protection Act, which came into force in May 2013. Following the entry into force of these amendments

<<<

 permit conditions are required to be based upon the ``BAT conclusions'' set out in the BAT reference documents (``BREFs"). According to our permit, the Lithuanian site complies with the applicable BAT requirements set out in the BREF document

<<<

 for the Glass Manufacturing Industry.

Waste
The waste management is regulated by the Act on Waste Management (VIII-787, Atlieku tvarkymo istatymas), the Act on the Management of Packaging and Packaging Waste (IX-517, Pakuociu ir pakuociu

<<<

 atlieku tvarkymo istatymas) and related regulations in Lithuania. The Lithuanian legislation is based on the provisions of appropriate EU directives.
In Lithuania, we are subject to statutory provisions regarding waste management. These provisions

<<<

 regulate permissible methods of, and responsibility for, the generation, handling, possession, discharge and recycling of waste depending, among other issues, on the dangers posed by the waste. The discharge and disposal of waste is usually

<<<

 restricted to licensed facilities. In accordance with the Act on Waste Management, both the producer and holder of waste are responsible for organizing waste management. This includes the obligation to see to the appropriate disposal of waste

<<<

 to landfills and waste processing facilities. Product manufacturers are also subject to obligations regarding the management of packaging waste. All waste management must comply with the statutorily prescribed order of priority, meaning that

<<<

 preventive measures must be implemented to minimize the generation of waste, and that generated waste should primarily be reused and secondarily recycled. If this is not possible, the waste should be utilized in, for example, the generation

<<<

 of energy. Disposal of waste is to be considered as a "last resort." In accordance with the "polluter-pays" principle, the original producer of waste is also liable for the costs of waste management. The waste holder's responsibility for organizing

<<<

 waste management is terminated and transferred to a new holder when the waste is delivered to a lawful consignee, for example, a professional waste treatment facility. The waste holder must report waste generation (on the basis of waste generation

<<<

 accounting log data) if the entity meets at least one of the following criteria: 1) it is obliged to obtain an IPPC permit; 2) it conducts activities that, within a calendar year, produce more than 12 tons of non-hazardous waste or 0.6 tons

<<<

 of hazardous waste, 3) it conducts motor vehicle maintenance and repair; 4) it has 10 or more employees engaged in activities involving pharmaceuticals, human or animal health; 5) it generates oil waste; 6) it is obliged to keep records of

<<<

 waste in accordance with the Rules on construction waste management adopted by the Order No. D1-637 of the Minister of the Environment. A Waste Management Report (based on the waste management accounting journal data) must be provided by an

<<<

 entity which meets at least one of the following criteria: 1) it is engaged in the processing of waste; 2) it is engaged in waste export from or imports to Lithuania; 3) it stores the waste at its generation place, where that wasted is either

<<<

 hazardous waste stored for longer than 6 months, or nonhazardous stored for longer than 1 year; 4) it is engaged in the collection or transportation of waste; or 5) it is a hazardous waste dealer or intermediary. There are also specific regulations

<<<

 regarding the packaging, labeling, mixing, storage and transport of hazardous waste. The management and treatment of waste is generally undertaken by professional waste management and treatment companies.
Due to our manufacturing operations

<<<

, we generate industrial and household waste. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable waste management laws and continuously attempt to reduce waste at our sites.
Hazardous Substances
In Lithuania, the handling and storage

<<<

 of hazardous chemical substances might be subject to an environmental permit if such activities pose a threat of environmental pollution in accordance with the Lithuanian Environmental Protection Act. This act provides that persons using hazardous

<<<

 chemicals must comply with established rules on the use of these substances. These rules apply to storage, accounting, disposal, treatment, transportation, transit, entry and exit procedures. The producer or user of the hazardous substance

<<<

 is responsible for the cost arising from the storage, disposal and treatment of such substances. The rules regarding the use of hazardous chemical substances and granting of permits are regulated by an order of the Minister of Environment.

<<<

 Prevention of industrial accidents is regulated under the Lithuanian Act on Civil Safety (VIII-971, Civilines saugos istatymas) and under the Environmental Protection Act.
Health and Safety
Corresponding requirements are found in the Lithuanian

<<<

 legislation. Our operations in Lithuania are regulated by the safety requirements set out in the Act on Safety and Health at Work (IX-1672, Darbuotoju saugos ir sveikatos istatymas). Employers are required to take care of the safety and health

<<<

 of our employees. The employer shall establish a safety and health at work policy in order to promote safety and health issues. The employer is also required to assess the hazards and risk factors caused by the work, the
156

premises and

<<<

 other working conditions and eliminate such risks. In order to comply with the applicable requirements, we regularly conduct training and medical examinations and implement and monitor safety measures. If we detect any unsafe condition in one

<<<

 of our sites, local management is authorized to act without further permission up to certain defined expenditure limits.
Regulation of Chemicals
We are subject to various notification and labeling requirements and have to comply with certain

<<<

 safety obligations arising, for example, under the Act on Chemical Substances and Preparations (VIII-1641, Cheminiu medziagu ir preparatu ustatymas). The Act on Chemical Substances and Preparations mainly reflects and supplements REACH at the

<<<

 national level, but also establishes national requirements on the handling of chemicals.
Technical Approvals for Construction Products
As we manufacture building materials the regulation on construction products is relevant to our activities

<<<

. In Lithuania, the manufacture and sale of construction materials is subject to technical regulations and approval requirements.
To establish that particular construction materials conform to the relevant technical approvals, as in many other

<<<

 jurisdictions manufacturers must implement and document a factory production control system in Lithuania. Depending on the produced product, Lithuanian law may require the initial testing of the construction product to be performed by an authorized

<<<

 body, continuous surveillance by a competent organization and/or assessment and approval of the construction products by such an organization. If construction materials that do not comply with applicable regulations have been used in a building

<<<

, then such building must be reconstructed or, if the materials used cannot be changed, demolished.
On July 1, 2013 the European Construction Products Regulation (No 305/2011) (the ``EU Construction Regulation") entered in the force in the whole

<<<

 EU. EU Construction Regulation provides the EU-level framework for the approvals and unified criteria for construction products. The fact that a product fulfills these criteria is shown through the ``CE'' marking. All products that belong under

<<<

 a harmonized product standard ("hEN") adopted by the European Committee for Standardization must be CE marked for commercialization.
Public Institution Enterprise Lithuania (Versli Lietuva) branch Business Gateway (Verslo vartai) is a responsible

<<<

 institution for the communication of implementing EU Construction Regulation. As this function is quite new for this institution, all practical issues are solved through the Construction Production Certification Center (Statybos produkcijos

<<<

 sertifikavimo centras, "SPSC").
The EU Construction Regulation also contains provisions on the granting of European technical assessments (``ETAs") for construction materials that are not under a harmonized product standard, in order to allow

<<<

 them to be distributed within the EU with the CE marking. Acquiring an ETA for a product is voluntary. The basic requirements of construction products listed in the EU Construction Regulation form a basis for the drafting of both harmonized

<<<

 product standards and ETAs.
The traditional technical assessment body granting ETAs in Lithuania is SPSC. The list of competent companies who are permitted to perform the technical assessment are enumerated in orders of the Minister of Environment

<<<

.
There are three main orders of the minister of Environment, related to construction product certification:
 Order No. D1-656 on Regulated construction products list (Reglamentuojamu statybos produktu syrasas), dated 5/9/22013;
 Order No

<<<

. D1-612 on Construction products, which do not have harmonized technical specifications, exploiting characteristics evaluation, verification and declaration. Tests laboratories and certification companies assignment (Statybos produktu, neturinciu

<<<

 darniuju techniniu specifikaciju, eksploataciniu savybiu pastovumo vertinimas, tikrinimas ir deklaravimas. Bandymu laboratoriju ir sertifikavimo istaigu paskyrimas), dated 26/09/2013;
 Order No. D1-871 on Appointment of bodies carrying out

<<<

 third party tasks in the assessment and verification of performance of construction products (Del istaigu, atliekanciu treciuju saliu uzduotis vertinant ir tikrinant statybos produktu eksploataciniu savybiu pastovumq, paskyrimo), dated 27/

<<<

11/2013.
157

In addition to assessment mechanisms for construction materials based on ETAs, other approval mechanisms are also in use in Lithuania. There is a national approval procedure for construction products which are not under any harmonized

<<<

 product standard and which do not have ETA, and thus cannot be CE marked. The purpose of the national approval procedure is to determine whether a product fulfills the substantial technical requirements imposed on construction products by the

<<<

 Lithuanian Act on Construction (I-1240, Statybos istatymas). The procedure is governed by the Lithuanian Act on Assessment of Conformity (VIII-870, Atitikties ivertinimo istatymas) and Act on Standardization (VIII-1618, Standartizacijos istatymas

<<<

). The acceptability of construction products can be certified by a competent company. These procedures are voluntary, but the sale of products that have not been certified may be prohibited by the decision of the State Non Food Products Inspectorate

<<<

.
Most of our construction products are under harmonized product standards and are hence CE marked. Some of our products are certified in the Lithuanian procedure. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable EU and Lithuanian

<<<

 legislation on construction materials.
Emission Trading Law in the European Union
Lithuania is a party to the Kyoto Protocol both individually and as part of the EU. The Emission Trading Directive 2003/87/EC has been implemented through the

<<<

 Lithuanian Act on Financial Instruments for Climate Change Management (XI-329, Klimato kaitos valdymo finansiniu instrument istatymas). Our operations at Vilnius are subject to the EU ETS. The site at Vilnius has participated in the EU ETS

<<<

 since the second EU ETS period from 2008 to 2012 as a combustion plant (thermal output more than 20 MW).
Energy efficiency regulations
The EU has also adopted directives regulating the energy efficiency of buildings, for example, the EU Directive

<<<

 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency and the EU Directive 2010/31/EU on the energy performance of buildings. The Energy Efficiency Directive (the "EED") targets a 20% increase in energy efficiency by 2020. The EED entered into force in December

<<<

 2012, and obliges Member States to set national energy efficiency targets and report any progress achieved towards these targets to the European Commission by April 30 of each year. Alternatively, under the EED Member States may opt to take

<<<

 other policy measures to achieve energy savings among final customers, provided that the amount of such savings is equivalent to the amount of new energy savings required by the energy efficiency obligation scheme option. New energy efficient

<<<

 goals for 2030, which are likely to be in excess of the present 20% reduction target, are also currently under review by the European Commission. The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (the "EPBD") instructs Member States to set minimum

<<<

 standards for energy efficiency in new and renovated buildings, which must be quantifiable and subject to a specified calculation methodology which takes into account multiple factors that influence energy use (e.g., thermal characteristics

<<<

 of the building, heating installation and hot water supply). However the EPBD does not specify what the specific performance standards should be. Detailed performance requirements are set at a national level, within the confines of certain

<<<

 EU guidelines, such as the requirement that all new buildings must be "near zero energy buildings'' by 2020.
The Lithuanian Act on Construction (I-1240, Statybos istatymas) implements the requirements set out in the latter Directive by providing

<<<

 that new and renovated buildings must fulfill the minimum energy efficiency requirements set out in the Lithuanian Technical Construction Regulations adopted by the Ministry of the Environment. These Regulations govern the evaluation and certification

<<<

 of energy efficiency of heated residential and non-residential buildings. Accordingly, construction developers must choose their construction materials with energy efficiency in mind. The same applies to repair and renovation constructions

<<<

.
Poland
Our Polish facilities are subject to extensive environmental regulation. The permit requirements on air emissions, water discharges and pollution control regarding our operations in Poland are based on Polish and EU legislation. See

<<<

 ``--Finland" above for information on European-wide regulations. The key Polish legislation covering the main areas of environmental protection is the Environmental Protection Law (ustawa Prawo ochrony srodowiska), while waste management issues

<<<

 are regulated by the Waste Act (ustawa o odpadach) and water contamination issues are governed by the Water Law (ustawa Prawo wodne). There are also numerous other acts and secondary legislation dealing with specific environmental issues.


<<<

158

Soil and Groundwater Contamination
In Poland, the use of water requires a permit and is strictly regulated to avoid any contamination of ground or surface water, such as through the disposal of sewage or waste water and the handling of

<<<

 potentially dangerous materials. For example, the discharge of any pollutant substances into the surface water may be subject to a permit, whereas the discharge of any such substances into the ground water in principle is impermissible. Under

<<<

 Polish law, water permits are generally granted for specific periods of time and must be renewed frequently. In certain circumstances, such water permits may be revoked without compensation.
Under Polish law (the Act on prevention and remediation

<<<

 of environmental damage) the obligations related to potential soil contamination rest with the person making use of the environment (irrespective of the legal title to the land). In other words, it is the person using the environment and whose

<<<

 activity causes the occurrence of environmental damage or an imminent threat of such damage that is obliged to undertake actions limiting such damage and preventing further damage, and to undertake remedial actions (the so-called ``polluterpays

<<<

 principle"). Consequently, all costs of preventive or remedial actions are borne by the person using the environment, unless such person proves that the damage to the environment was caused by another party and occurred despite the fact that

<<<

 the person using the environment applied appropriate safety measures. This general rule applies to contamination of land that occurred on and after April 30, 2007. However, in respect of so-called "historical contamination,'' i.e., the contamination

<<<

 that occurred prior to April 30, 2007 or that could be attributed to the activity completed prior to that date, the provisions of the Environmental Protection Law ("EPL") will apply. Pursuant to the EPL, if the soil contamination exceeds statutory

<<<

 limits (set forth in the secondary legislation to the EPL), the person who is currently in control of the land (i.e., the person revealed in the land register, in principle the owner or the perpetual usufructuary) is obligated to undertake

<<<

 remediation in order to reduce contamination to acceptable standards. There may be exceptions to this general rule (for example, where the contamination was caused by a third party after the acquisition of rights to the land by the person in

<<<

 control of the land or where it can be proved that the contamination arose before September 1, 1980), in which case any remediation required may be limited. In the case of groundwater contamination, strict remediation obligations do not apply

<<<

 (unless the water is used drinking purposes). This is because the groundwater is owned by the State Treasury (in accordance with the Water Law). As such, the principle of imposing remediation obligations on the owner is not applied. Instead

<<<

, the remediation obligation is generally imposed on the entity actually causing the contamination.
Although we believe that we are generally in compliance with our legal obligations at our Polish sites, groundwater contamination has been detected

<<<

 at our Trzemeszno site, and additional contamination of soil and groundwater may be discovered at these or other sites in the future. Such discovery of previously unknown contamination, or the imposition of new obligations to investigate or

<<<

 remediate soil or groundwater contamination, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operation. Following the implementation of the IED in Poland, a baseline report will also have to be prepared

<<<

 in respect of our Trzemeszno site, which could trigger remediation obligation if any contamination is discovered. See "--Emissions and Environmental Permits" below.
Emissions and Environmental Permits
Under the EPL and the Water Law, an environmental

<<<

 permit is required if, among other things, operation of an installation results in: (i) discharge of gases and particulates into air; (ii) discharge of sewage into water and soil; (iii) extraction of water for industrial purposes; and/or (iv

<<<

) generation of waste. Certain types of installation which do not cause substantial risks to the environment are exempted from the permit requirement. If a permit is required, an operator is required to obtain either a single integrated permit

<<<

 (IPPC permit) or an emission-specific permit. The requirement to obtain an IPPC permit applies to installations which might cause significant pollution to the environment. The exhaustive list of categories of such installations is set forth

<<<

 in the applicable implementing legislation under the EPL.
At our Trzemeszno facility in Poland, our Base Production operations operate under IPPC, EU-ETS and waste permits, and our TI operations have emission and waste permits. The Trzemeszno

<<<

 site has a water discharge (sewage and rain water) permit.
The IED implementation process in Poland is delayed and it is expected to be completed during 2014. The main assumptions for the proposed amendment to the EPL are as follows. Generally

<<<

, there will be a twelve-month period to review the terms of existing IPPC permits (in respect of certain terms, this period is shortened to three months). Any subsequent review must occur within six months after publication of the
159

relevant

<<<

 BAT conclusions. If a change of IPPC permit is necessary, the relevant authority may either (i) inform the installation operator of the obligation to adapt the installation during a period of no more than four years from publication of the

<<<

 BAT conclusions or, as the case may be, of entry into force of the new law, or (ii) summon the installation operator to file a motion to change the IPPC permit, in such case, there is also an adjustment period of no more than four years, however

<<<

 there will be a one-year period to file the motion, beginning from the date of the summons.
Waste
In Poland, plants must use licensed contractors for the disposal of hazardous or nonhazardous waste. Under the Polish Waste Act, only disposal

<<<

 to licensed contractors releases the plant from liability in respect of proper waste management. Furthermore, generation of waste over certain threshold requires an environmental permit to be held by the plant. The generation of waste requires

<<<

 detailed evidencing and reporting on annual basis (regardless of whether there is a permit requirement).
Hazardous Substances
In Poland, substances are rated by risk with different resulting requirements relating to storage and handling in

<<<

 order to prevent accidents or injury and ensure a high degree of safety. Certain hazardous substances must not be produced or used at all. Title IV of the Polish Environmental Protection Law implements the Seveso II Directive.
Recultivation

<<<


In Poland, a number of formal steps, including approvals of administrative authorities must be completed in connection with the closure of the operation plant. They follow from the Environmental Protection Law, the Act on Protection of Agricultural

<<<

 and Forest Land and the Mining and Geological Law (if applicable). The general aim of these procedures is to ensure full recultivation and revitalization of the degradated land.
Waste Selection
Moreover, in Poland, there are additional regulations

<<<

 concerning packaging waste under the Packaging and Waste Packaging Management Act. In particular, entities which market products (provided that the total annual weight of packaging exceeds 1 ton) are obliged to ensure the collection of a specific

<<<

 quantity of post-use and packaging waste from the market and subsequently recover or recycle it. It is possible, however, to delegate this obligation to a recovery organization (organizacja odzysku), which, in exchange for a determined fee

<<<

, assumes an entity's obligations relating to the collection of waste and its subsequent recovery or recycling.
Fees for Pollutant Discharges
Under the Polish regulatory regime in the EPL, we are obliged to keep records of pollutants discharged

<<<

 into the environment and, on the basis of such records as well as reports submitted to the relevant Voivodeship Marshal (marszaiek wojewodztwa), calculate and pay annual charges for using the environment.
Entities using the environment are

<<<

 obliged to keep records of pollutants introduced into the air, discharged sewage, intaken water, stockpiled waste and packaging and other items released into the market, where their waste is subject to special management rules (e.g., tires

<<<

, batteries, vehicles, and electric and electronic equipment). The obligation to keep such records is connected with the requirement to provide relevant authorities with periodic reports. On the basis of the above-mentioned records as well as

<<<

 reports submitted to the relevant Voivodeship Marshal, such entities are obliged to calculate and pay annual charges for using the environment.
Health and Safety
Our operations in Poland are regulated by the safety requirements set out in Chapter

<<<

 10 of the Labor Code (Kodeks pracy) as well as a number of other legislative acts. As an employer, we are required to take care of the safety and health of our employees. We are required to assess the hazards and risk factors caused by the

<<<

 work, premises and other working conditions and eliminate such risks. In order to comply with the applicable requirements, we are required to conduct training and medical examinations, and implement
160

and monitor safety measures. If we

<<<

 detect any unsafe condition in one of our sites, local management is authorized to act without further permission, up to certain defined expenditure limits.
Regulation of Chemicals
The Polish Act on Chemical Substances and their Mixtures implements

<<<

 the REACH regulations at the Polish national level and also establishes some additional requirements, including examination of hazardous substances, their packaging and storage.
Technical Approvals for Construction Products
The key regulation

<<<

 is the EU Construction Regulation, which is directly applicable in Poland. It is complemented by the Act on Construction Products (ustawa o wyrobach budowlanych).
Additional quality standards, known as Polish Norms (Polskie Normy), may also

<<<

 be applicable to our products in Poland. Their application is not, however, obligatory unless they have been included in an act or secondary legislation (including, in particular, the regulation of the Minister of Infrastructure on technical

<<<

 conditions of buildings and their location (rozporzg,dzenie w sprawie warunkow technicznych, jakim powinny odpowiadac budynki i ich usytuowanie)).
Emission Trading Law in the European Union
In Poland, the Emission Trading Directive 2003/87

<<<

/EC has been implemented by the Act on Greenhouse Gases Allowances Trading System and the Act on Emissions Management System of Greenhouse Gases and Other Substances. Our operations at Trzemeszno are subject to the EU ETS. The site at Trzemeszno

<<<

 has participated in the EU ETS since the second EU ETS period from 2009 to 2012 as a combustion plant (thermal output more than 20 MW).
Energy efficiency regulations
Polish regulations are gradually being amended to implement EU requirements

<<<

, as discussed in "--Finland" above. The regulation on technical conditions of buildings and their location (rozporzg.dzenie w sprawie warunkow technicznych, jakim powinny odpowiadac budynki i ich usytuowanie) has accordingly been amended with

<<<

 effect from January 1, 2014. The relevant amendments are aimed at a gradual increase in the requirements for thermal insulation, and reducing the ratio of total solar energy transmittance.
Pursuant to the Act on support of energy efficiency

<<<

 and modernization (Ustawa o wspieraniu termomodernizacji i remontow), a special program has been introduced providing financial support to the owners of buildings who decide to modernize them in order to raise the energy efficiency of the building

<<<

. In order to receive financial support, such modernization must lead to improvements to a building which result in energy and heat savings.
Russia
In Russia, we are subject to numerous laws, rules and regulations at the national, state and

<<<

 municipal levels, particularly building, environmental and occupational health and safety laws, rules and regulations, as well as technical standards.
As our business primarily comprises the operation of production plants for stone wool insulation

<<<

 products, laws, rules and regulations and technical standards that affect our operations mostly relate to product safety, environmental protection (in particular, in relation to soil, ground and surface water contaminations and air emissions

<<<

), waste management, recultivation, reclamation and renaturation, energy efficiency, as well as occupational health and safety.
In Russia, we are subject to a number of federal and regional acts and governmental decrees, as well as numerous

<<<

 environmental and sanitary-epidemiological regulations, which include the Federal Act "On Protection of Environment," the Water Code, the Land Code, the Federal Act ``On Production and Consumption Waste," Federal Act ``On Technical Regulation

<<<

," the Federal Act ``On Sanitary and Epidemiological Welfare of Population" and the Labor Code.
In Russia, as in many other jurisdictions, rules and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations, are becoming more comprehensive and

<<<

 stringent. The law making process in Russia is quite
161

intense and amendments may be so dramatic that they seriously affect the existing business and investment decisions.
Moreover, the laws and regulations are sometimes vague and require

<<<

 hiring and continuous training of technically qualified personnel to ensure compliance with applicable requirements. As our production in Russia is in "start-up" mode with limited operations underway, we are currently in the process of obtaining

<<<

 necessary authorization documents that may take some time and we may not be in compliance with certain regulations during this transition period.
We have been, and will continue to be, required to incur significant capital expenditures and

<<<

 operating costs in order to maintain and upgrade our production sites and facilities to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permits, and to obtain and maintain all necessary permits and certificates.
We are also required to obtain

<<<

 and maintain various permits from governmental authorities for our operations in Russia. As the federal and regional regulatory framework applicable to us is sometimes contradictory, unclear and incomplete and continues to experience frequent

<<<

 changes, it is very difficult to accurately predict the future cost of compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and technical standards. Additional or more stringent laws, rules, regulations and technical standards could increase

<<<

 our costs or limit our ability to continue our business operations in the same manner as we did in the past. Substantial gaps in the regulatory framework due to the delay or absence of implementing regulations for certain legislation, as well

<<<

 as the lack of judicial and administrative guidance on interpreting applicable rules, cause uncertainty with respect to many of the legal and business decisions that we make. See "Risk Factors--Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry

<<<

--We are subject to numerous environmental, building, health and safety regulations, technical standards and other regulations." and "--Our licenses, permits and certifications may be suspended, amended or terminated prior to the end of their

<<<

 terms or may not be renewed."
Soil
We are subject to numerous regulations relating to the use and contamination of soil in Russia.
As owners or lessors of land where we operate our business, in many jurisdictions, including Russia, we are obliged

<<<

 to monitor soil contamination and take necessary measures to remedy any contamination. Our historical and current operations involve operation of the production plants and lease of land plots that are or have been located on sites with a long

<<<

 history of industrial use by third parties. Such previous activities have resulted in soil contamination at some of our current and former sites or land adjacent to such sites.
In Russia, the current owner or lessee of a land plot may be held

<<<

 liable for historic contamination caused prior to the acquisition of the respective land plot. Although we pay significant attention to the due diligence of any land plot acquired, it is sometimes not possible to timely reveal and remedy contamination

<<<

. We are currently taking necessary actions towards remedy of soil contamination at our Tver site, but we cannot eliminate the possibility that there might be soil contamination discovered in the future that could result in substantial unanticipated

<<<

 cost to us. Claims for damages caused by environmental contamination may be brought up to 20 years from the time of the detection of environmental contamination.
Water
We are subject to several laws relating to the use of water sources and

<<<

 discharge of waste water and emission of pollutants into water in Russia. In our Russian operations, we use water supplied by the municipal provider, as well as storm water. In Russia, the use of water, water discharge and water pollution are

<<<

 subject to a number of administrative decisions and permits, as well as other related documentation developed by us and approved by the state authorities. The applicable requirements, as well as the terms of the permits we hold, materially

<<<

 affect our operations by restricting the discharge of pollutant substances and waste water exceeding certain thresholds. Moreover, emissions, including in excess of the permitted thresholds, are subject to payment of certain fees (which in

<<<

 the case of our Tver plant may be double the standard amount due to its location in a specially protected natural area) and we may not exclude that such fees may become higher in the course of development of the legislation.
Air Emissions
In

<<<

 Russia, we must comply with the applicable legislation on air emission, including the Federal Act ``On Protection of Environment" and respective governmental decrees. We are obliged to, among other things,
162

approve norms of emissions and

<<<

 obtain limits on maximum permitted emissions with local authorities, as well as obtain certain permits. We are required to maintain all production facilities in compliance with the permit documentation and comply with the agreed plan for the

<<<

 reduction of emissions. Compliance with these requirements is monitored by the local authorities and we are required to submit emission reports on a regular basis. Failure to comply with the maximum emission levels may result in administrative

<<<

 fines. Moreover, emissions, including in excess of the permitted thresholds, are subject to payment of certain fees (which in the case of our Tver plant may be double the standard amount due to its location in a specially protected natural

<<<

 area) and we may not exclude that such fees may become higher in the course of development of the legislation.
Waste
In Russia, our production operations inevitably lead to generation of various types of waste, including basalt fiber waste

<<<

, solid mineral waste and coke pieces. Waste management is generally regulated by the Federal Act "On Production and Consumption Waste.''
All waste is classified in Russia depending on its hazardous qualities and each category of waste may require

<<<

 different treatment. Depending on the hazardous type of the generated waste, it may also be required to confirm the classification of waste, obtain a passport of waste and employ persons with special qualifications. Some categories of hazardous

<<<

 waste require special licenses for collection, storage, transportation and disposal and we will engage specialized waste management providers. Moreover, we are obliged to develop and approve with the relevant state authority norms and limits

<<<

 for various categories of waste, record compliance with such limits, pay for the placement of waste and obtain the respective permits. Our fees for the placement of waste may be double the standard amount due to the location of our Tver plant

<<<

 within a specially protected area.
Hazardous Substances
In Russia, production, sale and handling of certain chemical, biological, radioactive and other potentially hazardous substances is governed by special laws and regulations. For example

<<<

, depending on the substance, special regulations on importation, transportation, production, labeling and industrial safety requirements may apply.
At our sites and facilities, we may from time to time handle and use hazardous substances. The

<<<

 use of some hazardous substances may lead to the creation of a dangerous industrial facility, as described below. We need to ensure that there is no uncontrolled release of substances pursuant to applicable laws. Although, historically, some

<<<

 violations of the storage procedures have taken place, we continuously take steps to improve compliance with the handling of hazardous substances.
Products Requirements
Products imported by us to Russia and manufactured by us in Russia require

<<<

 various registrations and other compliance documents in order to be permitted for importing to and sale in Russia. Such documents include, in particular, sanitary and epidemiological certificates confirming safety compliance of the products

<<<

, compliance certificates confirming fire safety compliance and manufacturing processes, as well as technical certificates for the use of products in the construction industry. Moreover, production in Russia must comply with specific sanitary

<<<

 and industry standards and norms.
We believe that we are generally in compliance with products requirements in respect of importing and that we will be able to obtain necessary documents for the production in Russia. However, maintenance of

<<<

 these authorization documents and compliance with the production standards require, and will continue to require in the future, our constant monitoring and possible expenditures in relation to new regulations and demands from authorities. Products

<<<

 requirements are constantly changing in Russia and we may not guarantee that product manufacturing in Russia is fully compliant with all applicable regulations at any given time.
Industrial Safety Regulations
Certain production sites or separate

<<<

 facilities thereon that relate to production of dangerous substances or use of dangerous equipment may be deemed in Russia to be dangerous industrial facilities. It is possible that following the completion of construction of our facilities

<<<

 in Russia some of our facilities may be deemed dangerous industrial facilities. This classification triggers the need to comply with industrial safety
163

regulations, such as (i) implementing industrial safety control procedures; (ii) registering

<<<

 dangerous industrial facilities with the state authorities; (iii) using trained personnel; and (iv) obtaining liability insurance, among others. We have taken some, but not all, of the necessary measures to comply with the industrial safety

<<<

 regulations and will continue improving our compliance, but some time may pass before we become fully compliant. Moreover, some of our facilities in Russia (gas consumption facilities) may be regarded as explosive dangerous industrial facilities

<<<

 of III hazard class and, if this is the case, we will need to obtain a relevant license in order to operate gas consumption facilities. We have commenced this process, but the license is expected only at the end of 2014. Certain administrative

<<<

 sanctions (including temporary restriction of operations) may be imposed on our operations in Russia if we fail to promptly complete all industrial safety compliance procedures.
Health and Safety We must comply with applicable laws and regulations

<<<

 to protect employees against occupational injuries in Russia. Under such laws and regulations, employers typically must establish that working conditions effectively prevent dangers to employees. In particular, employers must observe certain

<<<

 medical and hygienic standards and comply with certain occupational health and safety requirements, such as permissible maximum levels for noise at the work place, the use of personal protective equipment and requirements relating to maximum

<<<

 temperatures and air ventilation. In order to comply with the applicable requirements, we regularly conduct training and medical examinations and implement and monitor safety measures. If we detect any unsafe condition in one of our sites,

<<<

 local management is authorized to act without further permission up to certain defined expenditure limits. Our production facilities in Russia are located in the close vicinity of a number of residential households. Any production facility

<<<

 in Russia must establish a sanitary protection zone to protect surrounding territories from negative impact. We are in the process of establishing such a protection zone and, if we are unable to set it less than 300 meters, we may face the

<<<

 need to relocate a number of local residents. However, we do not expect major difficulties or expenditures in this regard.
Other Regulations Production activities and conducting business in Russia as such are subject to various general and

<<<

 specific regulations. For example, each company that owns or operates a facility, including premises, must comply with certain fire safety rules in accordance with the Federal Act ``On Fire Safety.'' All companies must adopt internal instructions

<<<

 on fire safety at the premises, arrange for a special training course on fire safety for the employees, ensure preparation of evacuation plan at the premises and have firefighting equipment. The applicable fire safety rules set forth a number

<<<

 of exceptionally detailed rules governing the manufacturing process. For instance, the CEO of the company must ensure regular cleaning of the production premises and, in particular, extraction systems. Failure to comply with the fire safety

<<<

 rules may result in administrative sanctions, including, in the extreme, temporary restriction of operations. We undertake necessary steps in ensuring compliance with the fire safety rules and may engage specialized consultants to monitor the

<<<

 situation in the future. Furthermore, we need to comply with various employment regulations, including applicable migration legislation and legislation on certification of working conditions for our employees that may result in additional expenses

<<<

. Overall, we are taking necessary steps to ensure compliance with various Russian regulations in our Russian business, but no full immediate compliance can be reached.

<<<

 and a select group of employees who had invested in the previous long-term share-based investment plan. In accordance with the plan, the management shareholders set up a special purpose vehicle in Luxembourg (Diabase S.A.) and subscribed for

 shares in Diabase S.A. Diabase S.A. purchased in total 13.02% of the share capital of Safari Luxco 2 S.A., which owns the Paroc Group Oy share capital indirectly through Safari Finco 1 Oy.
According to the terms and conditions of the investment

<<<

 plan, the shares of Diabase S.A. cannot be sold, pledged or otherwise disposed of, and the shareholder is obliged to sell his or her shares when he or she ceases to be employed by a company belonging to the Paroc Group. Any return on the plan

<<<

 is expected only when there is an exit, i.e., Paroc Group or a major part thereof is sold and when the exit yields more than certain predetermined thresholds. In accordance with the shareholders' agreement (the "Diabase SHA") the fair market

<<<

 value of the shares is determined annually in accordance with the principles set out in the Diabase SHA by an independent accountant. At the end of the 2013 financial year, there were 114 employees and four non-executive board members of Paroc

<<<

 Group companies holding shares in Diabase S.A. (2012: 118 employees and four non-executive board members). The four non-executive board members also directly own 1.98% shares of Safari Luxco 2 S.A. with any return on the plan expected only

<<<

<<<

 eight exiting employees).

The preference shares held by management (both directly and through Diabase S.A.) in Luxco 2 are non-voting shares, and under the Shareholders

<<<

' Agreement management has agreed not to vote the shares (such agreement being secured by a pledge of management's shares held through Diabase S.A. (the shares in Luxco 2 held directly by non-executive directors are not pledged) to Luxco 1 under

<<<

 a share pledge agreement dated December 23, 2009).
Stapling The Shareholders' Agreement contains provisions as to the circumstances in which transfers of shares of Luxco 1 or Luxco 2 may take place. It also contains stapling provisions that

<<<

, upon the transfer of ordinary shares of Luxco 1 by an Investor, require the Investor to also transfer a corresponding proportion of their holdings of specified debt instruments (other than the Existing Junior Notes issued by Safari Finco 

<<<

1 Oy, but including the tracking preferred equity certificates issued by Luxco 1).
Management Exit Rights The Shareholders' Agreement contains provisions dealing with the rights and obligations of management shareholders in the event of an initial

<<<

<<<

 1 (each, an ``Exit Event"). Prior to the occurrence of an Exit Event, the ordinary shares held by management have no economic rights or entitlement to any profits of Luxco 2, and the preference shares held by management are entitled to a priority

<<<

 share of the profits of Luxco 2 and any dividend of Luxco 2 equal to 0.1% of the nominal value of such shares. However, upon the occurrence of an Exit Event:  the management ordinary shares have the same rights to the profits of Luxco 2 as

<<<

as at the date of the Exit Event (``Management

<<<

 Preference Share Profits")--this specified amount increases from the date of the Shareholders' Agreement, up to a specified maximum amount. The Shareholders' Agreement also contains provisions designed to ensure that management shareholders

<<<

 receive a certain percentage of the total returns realized by the Investors and their affiliates (subject to certain exceptions) over a specified threshold.

<<<

 for similar agreements, including:  the conditions under which an Exit Event may take place;  the conditions under which issuances of shares of Luxco 1 or any Group Company may take place;  the conditions under which transfers of shares

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
In the course of our ordinary business activities, we regularly enter into agreements with or render services to related parties. In turn, such related parties may

<<<

 render services or deliver goods to us as part of their business. Purchase and supply agreements between subsidiaries and affiliated companies and with associated companies or shareholders of such associated companies, including non-controlling

<<<

 interests, that are not part of our Group are entered into on a regular basis within the ordinary course of business. Such transactions include, but are not limited to, the supply of raw materials for the production of our products and the

<<<

 sale of our products and the products manufactured by any entity described above. Furthermore, financing agreements and cash pooling agreements with and among subsidiaries and affiliated companies are entered into during the ordinary course

<<<

 of business.
We believe that all transactions with affiliated companies and persons with which members of our board of directors are affiliated are negotiated and conducted on a basis equivalent to those that would have been achievable on an

<<<

 arm's-length basis, and that the terms of these transactions are comparable to those currently contracted with unrelated third-party suppliers, manufacturers and service providers.
We have the following balances with related parties:

Shareholder Loans of Safari Finco 1 Oy
On December 23, 2009, in the context

<<<

 of our debt restructuring, we entered into a junior note trust deed (the ``J u n io r N o te Trust D e e d ") under which Safari Finco 1 Oy issued junior notes (the "E x istin g J u n io r N o te s ") in an aggregate principal amount of 10

<<<

0 million to the Lender-Owner Syndicate, which Existing Junior Notes continue to be held by the Lender-Owner Syndicate. A portion of the proceeds of the Offering, together with cash on hand, will be used to (i) partially redeem, and pay accrued

<<<

 and unpaid interest on, the Existing Junior Notes and (ii) fund the purchase by Safari Luxco 2 S.A. of Existing Junior Notes from the Lender-Owner Syndicate. See "U se o f P r o c e e d s ."
Certain amendments will be made to the Junior Note

<<<

 Trust Deed (including the conditions) prior to and on the Issue Date pursuant to an amendment agreement dated on or about the date of this offering memorandum between Safari Finco 1 Oy and ING Bank N.V., London Branch as junior note trustee

<<<

 and security agent in respect of the Existing Junior Notes and the Existing Senior Indebtedness (the ``A m e n d e d J u n io r N o te T erm s") under which the Existing Junior Notes terms will be amended and restated so that they constitute

<<<

 unsecured subordinated loan notes of Safari Finco 1 Oy (the ``S h a re h o ld e r L o a n s "). These amendments are reflected in the following basic summary. The Shareholder Loans will be in an aggregate principal amount equivalent to the

<<<

 aggregate principal amount of Existing Junior Notes not redeemed at the Issue Date and will mature in 2022. The Shareholder Loans will bear pay-in-kind interest at a rate of EURIBOR plus 975 basis points per annum. The Shareholder Loans will

<<<

 not be guaranteed, will be unsecured and will be subordinated pursuant to the Amended Junior Note Terms to the Notes and the New Revolving Credit Facility (provided that redemption by any person other than Safari Finco 1 Oy or a member of the

<<<

 Restricted Group shall be permitted). The Shareholder Loans will be mandatorily repayable if a lender becomes aware that it has become unlawful for it to fund or maintain its holding or participation in the Shareholder Loans. Subject to the

<<<

 terms of the subordination contained in the Amended Junior Note Terms, Safari Finco 1 Oy may repay the Shareholder Loans in whole or in part upon five business days' notice. There will be no covenants, representations or events of default in

<<<

 the Amended Junior Note Terms.
New Revolving Credit Facility
On or about the Issue Date, as a result of the Transactions, the Existing Senior Facility and the Existing Senior Notes are expected to be repaid in full and discharged, and we expect

<<<

 on or before the Issue Date to enter into the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.
As of the date of this offering memorandum, it has been agreed that the initial availability of utilizations under the New Revolving Credit Facility will

<<<

 be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent, including (i) the issuance of the Notes on the Issue Date in an aggregate principal amount of 430 million and (ii) evidence of the repayment in full on the Issue Date of the amounts

<<<

 owed and the cancellation of commitments under the Existing Senior Facility and the Existing Senior Notes.
General
In conjunction with the Transactions, we expect to enter into the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement with a group of lenders

<<<

 which provides for up to 60.0 million of borrowing available in euro, sterling, SEK, USD, PLN and NOK, which can be utilised by way of loans, letters of credit or other ancillary facilities.
The commitments under the New Revolving Credit Facility

<<<

 terminate on the later of (i) the date falling five years from the Issue Date and (ii) the date falling six months prior to the maturity of the Notes (as notified to the New Revolving Credit Facility agent (the ``A g e n t")) or, if earlier

<<<

, 61/2 years from the Issue Date. The New Revolving Credit Facility, and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with it, will be governed by, and will be enforced in accordance with, English law, although certain of

<<<

 the restrictive and other covenants which are included in the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will be interpreted in accordance with New York law (without prejudice to the fact that the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement is governed

<<<

 by English law).
174

In addition, subject to certain conditions, additional tranches and/or facilities may be added under the New Revolving Credit Facility by utilising an accordion amount (which, when aggregated with any other such additions

<<<

, does not exceed the applicable baskets therefor corresponding to those permitted under the Notes).
Borrowers
The original borrower under the New Revolving Credit Facility will be Paroc Oy Ab.
Letters of credit and guarantees
No letters of

<<<

 credit or guarantees will be drawn under the New Revolving Credit Facility on the Issue Date. However, an amount of up to SEK 35 million will be made available for such purpose under an ancillary facility by ING Bank N.V., London Branch, in

<<<

 order to roll our existing Pensions L/C in such amount into the New Revolving Credit Facility.
Guarantees and security
The New Revolving Credit Facility will be guaranteed and secured on a senior basis by the same subsidiaries that will guarantee

<<<

 and provide security in respect of the Notes and the Issuer, being the Guarantors (save that ZAO Paroc will not provide any security). For the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, the guarantors generated 95.3% of the Group's EBITDA and,

<<<

 as of December 31, 2013, directly held 94.6% of the Group's consolidated total assets. As set forth in the New Revolving Credit Facility, the obligations of companies providing guarantees and security will be subject to certain customary limitations

<<<

 in order to comply with applicable laws in the jurisdictions of incorporation of the relevant companies. The guarantees will constitute direct, unconditional and unsubordinated obligations of the guarantors and rank at least pari passu with

<<<

 all other future unsubordinated obligations of the guarantors, except as otherwise provided by mandatory law.
Guarantor coverage test
The New Revolving Credit Facility will contain a covenant requiring that the aggregate Consolidated Pro Forma

<<<

 EBITDA and gross assets (excluding intra-group items and goodwill) of the borrower and the guarantors from time to time (but excluding any Russian Guarantors) equals or exceeds 80% of the Consolidated Pro Forma EBITDA and total gross assets

<<<

 (excluding intra-group items and goodwill) of the Group (but excluding any Russian Subsidiaries). The guarantor coverage test will be tested on a semi-annual basis. We must ensure that additional subsidiaries acquired or which become material

<<<

 subsidiaries accede to the New Revolving Credit Facility as additional guarantors in order to maintain compliance with the guarantor coverage test within 60 days from the test date.
Amount and repayment of borrowings
The minimum amount of borrowing

<<<

 under the New Revolving Credit Facility will be 2 million and no more than 12 revolving advances may be outstanding at any one time. Each borrowing must be repaid on the last day of the borrowing's interest period, which can be a period of

<<<

 one, two, three or six months as selected by the borrower in the relevant drawdown notice or any other period agreed by the borrower and the lenders, and all loans must be repaid in full on the termination date.
Interest rates and fees
The

<<<

 annual interest rate on borrowings will be calculated based on EURIBOR, plus a margin of 3.25% per annum. The margin is subject to a margin ratchet and may be reduced by reference to the Group's Leverage Ratio (as defined in the New Revolving

<<<

 Credit Facility Agreement). Interest on borrowings will be payable on the last day of the respective interest periods for such borrowing.
The borrower is also obligated to pay a commitment fee computed on the daily unutilized, uncanceled amount

<<<

, of the New Revolving Credit Facility at a rate of 37.5% of the margin.
Note Purchase condition
The New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will have restrictions on the ability of the Group to repay, prepay, purchase, redeem, defease (or otherwise

<<<

 retire for value) ("Purchase") the Notes and certain other categories of its debt (excluding the New Revolving Credit Facility) (together, the "Relevant Debt"). The Group will be able to purchase the Relevant Debt in accordance with the Intercreditor

<<<

 Agreement (i) if
175

such Purchase is made following the occurrence of a change of control (as defined in the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement), the Group is in compliance with its obligations under the change of control mandatory

<<<

 prepayment clause; or (ii) if no event of default under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement is continuing or would result from the Purchase and (A) the total aggregate principal amount of all Relevant Debt Purchased since the Issue

<<<

 Date does not exceed 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes issued on the Issue Date; or (B) to the extent the total aggregate principal amount of the Relevant Debt Purchased since the Issue Date exceeds 50% of the aggregate principal

<<<

 amount of all Notes on the Issue Date, commitments under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement are cancelled (and, if applicable, amounts outstanding under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement are prepaid) pro rata.
Change of control

<<<


Upon the occurrence of a ``Change of Control'' as defined under the New Revolving Credit Facility: (a) the Issuer shall, promptly upon becoming aware of that event, notify the RCF Agent (as defined in ``Creditor representative" under "Intercreditor

<<<

 Agreement," below), and the RCF Agent shall promptly notify the lenders; (b) a lender will not be obliged to fund a utilisation (except for a rollover loan) under the New Revolving Credit Facility; and (c) (subject to the ability of the Issuer

<<<

 to replace that lender as described below) if a lender requires and notifies the RCF Agent within 30 days of the RCF Agent notifying the lenders of the Change of Control, the RCF Agent shall, by not less than ten Business Days' notice to the

<<<

 Issuer, cancel the commitments of that lender and declare the participations of that Lender in all outstanding utilisations (including ancillary facility outstandings), together with accrued interest, and all other amounts accrued under the

<<<

 New Revolving Facility finance documents, immediately due and payable.
If a lender gives a notification as described under (c) above, the Issuer may (on not less than five Business Days' prior written notice to the RCF Agent and such lender

<<<

, or such shorter period as that lender may agree), replace that lender by requiring it to transfer all (and not part only) of its rights and obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement to a replacement lender (which may be

<<<

 an affiliate of the ultimate shareholders of the Issuer, amongst other entities) selected by the Issuer (and otherwise in compliance with the terms of the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) for a purchase price in cash payable at the

<<<

 time of transfer equal to the outstanding principal amount of such lender's participations and all accrued interest, fees, costs and other amounts payable under the New Revolving Credit Facility finance documents. The replacement of a lender

<<<

 in such circumstances is subject to a number of further conditions, including that the Issuer shall have no right to replace the RCF Agent (other than in specified circumstances) or Security Agent.
Financial covenant
Under the New Revolving

<<<

 Credit Facility the Issuer will be obliged to ensure compliance with a financial covenant and the availability of new money amounts under the New Revolving Credit Facility will also be subject to the covenant. This financial covenant will be

<<<

 tested only if on the last day of a financial quarter the New Revolving Credit Facility is drawn by way of cash or otherwise, but excluding any utilisation of ancillary facilities by way of the SEK 35 million letter of credit referred to above

<<<

. The covenant requires that the ratio of Total Drawn Super Senior Debt (the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding utilisations other than by way of the SEK 35 million letter of credit referred to above) to Consolidated Pro Forma EBITDA

<<<

 as at the last day of the relevant financial quarter does not exceed 2.00:1. If tested, the borrower has right to cure any covenant breach by procuring the injection to Parent of new equity or subordinated debt, limited to four times during

<<<

 the life of the New Revolving Credit Facility and not in consecutive quarters. Breach of the covenant if tested (but subject to the cure right) results in an event of default.
We currently believe that, due to the level of headroom contained

<<<

 in the financial covenant, the financial covenant ratio contained in the New Revolving Credit Facility will be less onerous than the financial covenants in the Existing Senior Facility.
Undertakings
In addition to the financial covenant, the

<<<

 New Revolving Credit Facility will include the following affirmative covenants: mandatory periodic reporting of financial and other information, compliance certificate for financial covenant and guarantor coverage, annual budget within 45 days

<<<

 of year-end, annual presentation, notice upon the occurrence of events of default and certain other events.
176

Events of default
The New Revolving Credit Facility will include certain events of default, such as failure to make payment of

<<<

 amounts due, defaults under other agreements evidencing indebtedness, failure to comply with the financial covenant or other obligations, certain bankruptcy events and unlawfulness or repudiation/ rescission of certain agreements. The occurrence

<<<

 of an event of default could result in the acceleration of payment obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility.
Intercreditor Agreement
In connection with the entry into the New Revolving Credit Facility and the Indenture, the Issuer

<<<

, the Guarantors and certain other subsidiaries of the Issuer will enter into the Intercreditor Agreement to govern the relationships and relative priorities among: (i) the lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility (the "RCFLenders");

<<<

 (ii) any persons that accede to the Intercreditor Agreement as counterparties to certain hedging agreements (collectively, the "Hedging Agreements", the liabilities under such Hedging Agreements, the `Hedging Liabilities" and any persons that

<<<

 accede to the Intercreditor Agreement as counterparties to such Hedging Agreements being referred to in such capacity as the `Hedge Counterparties"); (iii) the Trustee, on its own behalf and on behalf of the holders of the Notes (the "Noteholders

<<<

"); (iv) intragroup creditors and debtors; and (vi) any persons that accede to the Intercreditor Agreement as direct or indirect shareholders of the Issuer in respect of certain structural debt that the Issuer or another member of the Group

<<<

 has incurred or may incur in the future (including any subordinated shareholder loans).
In this description:
 "Issuer Group" refers to the Issuer and each of its Restricted Subsidiaries for the time being; and
 each member of the Issuer Group

<<<

 that incurs any liability or provides any guarantee under the New Revolving Credit Facility, in respect of the Notes or under any other Debt Document (as defined in "--Further security and incremental borrowings" below) is referred to as a

<<<

 "Debtor" and are collectively referred to as the "Debtors."
The Intercreditor Agreement will set forth:
 the relative ranking of certain indebtedness of the Debtors;
 the relative ranking of certain security granted by the Debtors;
 when

<<<

 payments can be made in respect of certain indebtedness of the Debtors;
 when enforcement actions can be taken in respect of that indebtedness;
 the terms pursuant to which that indebtedness will be subordinated upon the occurrence of certain

<<<

 insolvency events;
 turnover provisions; and
 when security and guarantees will be released to permit a sale of any assets subject to transaction security (such security, the "Transaction Security" and the documents constituting such Transaction

<<<

 Security, the ``Transaction Security Documents").
The Intercreditor Agreement will contain provisions relating to future indebtedness that may be incurred by the members of the Issuer Group, which is permitted or not prohibited under the New

<<<

 Revolving Credit Facility, the Indenture, any existing Pari Passu Debt Document (as defined below) and any existing Senior Unsecured Notes Document (as defined below) to rank pari passu in right of payment with the liabilities under the New

<<<

 Revolving Credit Facility, the liabilities under the Notes, and any existing Pari Passu Liabilities (as defined below) and to be secured on the Collateral, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (such indebtedness being the ``Pari

<<<

 Passu Debt," the creditors in respect of such indebtedness being the ``Pari Passu Creditors", the liabilities of the Debtors in respect of such indebtedness being the ``Pari Passu Liabilities" and the documents creating or evidencing the Pari

<<<

 Passu Liabilities, the "Pari Passu Debt Documents").
The Intercreditor Agreement will also include provisions relating to future indebtedness in the form of senior unsecured notes (such indebtedness being ``Senior Unsecured Notes", the liabilities

<<<

 of the Debtors in respect of such indebtedness being ``Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities" and the documents creating or evidencing the Senior Unsecured Notes Liabilities, the ``Senior Unsecured Notes Documents") that may be incurred by a special

<<<

 purpose entity incorporated for that purpose which is wholly-owned by persons which are the direct or indirect shareholders of the Issuer and/or their respective transferees and assignees and
177

that is not a member of the Issuer Group or

<<<

 a subsidiary of the Issuer (such entity, the "Senior Unsecured Notes Issuer") and the liabilities in respect of guarantees granted by each guarantor of the Senior Unsecured Notes (the "Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantee Liabilities") which is

<<<

 permitted or not prohibited under the New Revolving Credit Facility, the Indenture, any existing Pari Passu Debt Document and any existing Senior Unsecured Notes Document to rank in right of payment after the liabilities under the New Revolving

<<<

 Credit Facility, the liabilities under the Notes and any existing Pari Passu Liabilities.
The Intercreditor Agreement will also provide after the RCF Discharge Date, as defined below, for any credit facility constituting a "Credit Facility

<<<

" under the Indenture, the creditors of which are entitled under the terms of the Indenture and any existing Pari Passu Debt Document to receive priority in respect of the proceeds of the enforcement against the Collateral (each such facility

<<<

 being a "Credit Facility" and, together with the New Revolving Credit Facility, the "Credit Facilities" and each finance document relating thereto, a "Credit Facility Document"). Each lender under a Credit Facility is a "Credit Facility Lender

<<<

" and the liabilities of the Debtors to the Credit Facility Lenders are referred to as the "Credit Facility Lender Liabilities."
The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that all Hedging Liabilities in connection with a Hedging Agreement will

<<<

 constitute "Super Senior Liabilities" (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), provided that certain Hedging Liabilities not in relation to the Notes, New Revolving Credit Facility, Pari Passu Debt or Senior Unsecured Notes may be designated

<<<

 as Super Senior Hedging Liabilities. The Issuer and the relevant Hedge Counterparty shall designate by notice to the Security Agent the maximum amount of any Hedging Liabilities under or in connection with such Hedging Agreement up to which

<<<

 the relevant Hedge Counterparty shall at any time be entitled to share in the proceeds of enforcement of any Transaction Security created by any Transaction Security Document and receive recoveries pari passu with the RCF Lenders. All Hedging

<<<

 Liabilities (a) under or in connection with Hedging Agreements entered into for the purpose of hedging (i) interest rate or currency exposures in relation to Senior Secured Liabilities (other than Hedging Liabilities) and (ii) certain actual

<<<

 or projected exposures in relation to certain non-speculative ordinary course funding and commercial activities, provided in the case of (ii) that the marked-to-market value of the hedging so designated which does not exceed 10 million in aggregate

<<<

 at any time (the ``Super Senior Hedging Cap"); and (b) after the RCF Discharge Date (as defined below) to the extent such Hedging Liability is permitted under each Debt Document to (i) rank pari passu with all other Super Senior Liabilities

<<<

 under the Debt Documents and (ii) receive proceeds of enforcement ahead of the Senior Secured Liabilities in accordance with the proceeds waterfall, shall be ``Super Senior Hedging Liabilities", and each Hedge Counterparty to the extent such

<<<

 liabilities are Super Senior Hedging Liabilities being the ``Super Senior Hedge Counterparty"). After the RCF Discharge Date, the Super Senior Hedging Cap shall continue to apply and all Hedging Liabilities under or in connection with any Hedging

<<<

 Agreement (other than in respect of certain non-speculative ordinary course activities) and all Hedging Liabilities with respect to certain non-speculative ordinary course activities hedging within the Super Senior Hedging Cap shall continue

<<<

 to be treated as Super Senior Hedging Liabilities irrespective of when the relevant Hedging Agreement was entered into but subject to the terms of each Debt Document and provided that such Hedging Liabilities may only receive the proceeds of

<<<

 enforcement ahead of the Senior Secured Liabilities in accordance with the proceeds waterfall to the extent permitted under each Debt Document.
Unless expressly stated otherwise in the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event of a conflict between

<<<

 the terms of the New Revolving Credit Facility, the Indenture, any Pari Passu Debt Document, any Senior Unsecured Notes Document and the Intercreditor Agreement, the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement will prevail.
By purchasing a Note

<<<

, Noteholders shall be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted the terms and conditions of, the Intercreditor Agreement and to have authorized the Trustee to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement on their behalf.
The following description is

<<<

 a summary of certain provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement. It does not restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety.
Ranking and priority
The Intercreditor Agreement will provide, subject to the provisions in respect of permitted

<<<

 payments described below, that (i) the Credit Facility Lender Liabilities, (ii) the Super Senior Hedging Liabilities, (iii) the Creditor Representative Liabilities owed to each Credit Facility Agent (and together with the Super Senior Hedging

<<<

 Liabilities and the Credit Facility Lender Liabilities, the ``Super Senior Liabilities"
178

and the creditors of the Super Senior Liabilities, the "Super Senior Creditors"), (iv) any Hedging Liabilities that do not constitute Super Senior

<<<

 Hedging Liabilities (the "Non-Super Senior Hedging Liabilities" and each Hedge Counterparty to the extent they are owed Non-Super Senior Hedging Liabilities, the "Non-Super Senior Hedge Counterparty"), (v) the liabilities of the Issuer and

<<<

 the Debtors in respect of the Notes (the "Notes Liabilities"), (vi) the Pari Passu Liabilities, (vii) the Creditor Representative Liabilities owed to the Trustee (and together with the Pari Passu Liabilities, Notes Liabilities and the Non-Super

<<<

 "Security Agent Liabilities"), (x) the Creditor Representative Liabilities owed to the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee (the "Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee Amount") and (xi) certain other unsecured liabilities will rank in right and priority

<<<

 of payment in the following order:
 first, the Super Senior Liabilities, the Senior Secured Liabilities, the Security Agent Liabilities and the Senior Unsecured Notes Trustee Amounts pari passu and without any preference between them;
 second

<<<

, the Senior Unsecured Notes Guarantee Liabilities, pari passu and without preference between them.
The intercompany obligations of any member of the Issuer Group to any other member of the Issuer Group (each, an "Intra Group Lender" and collectively

<<<

, the "Intra Group Lenders") and such liabilities being referred to in this description as the "Intra Group Liabilities") are postponed and subordinated to the Liabilities owed to the Primary Creditors.
The liabilities in respect of investor

<<<

 debt owed by any Debtor to any shareholder, direct or indirect, of the Issuer (or any holding company or subsidiary of the Issuer or any other subsidiary of any such holding company that is not a member of the Issuer Group) and any of their

<<<

 respective transferees or successors are postponed and subordinated to the Liabilities owed to the Primary Creditors.
In this section any liabilities owed by any Debtor to any shareholder, direct or indirect, of the Issuer are referred to as

<<<

 "Shareholder Liabilities" and together with the Intra Group Liabilities, the "Subordinated Liabilities."
The parties to the Intercreditor Agreement will agree in the Intercreditor Agreement that the Transaction Security provided for the Super

<<<

 Senior Liabilities, the Notes Liabilities, the Pari Passu Liabilities, the Hedging Liabilities, the Security Agent Liabilities, the Creditor Representative Liabilities and the parallel debt liabilities pursuant to the terms in relation thereto

<<<

 under the Intercreditor Agreement (together the "Secured Liabilities") will rank and secure all such liabilities pari passu and without any preference between them.
Further security and incremental borrowings
The creditors in respect of the

<<<

 Secured Liabilities (the "Secured Parties" and the documents evidencing the Secured Liabilities, the "Secured Debt Documents") may take, accept or receive the benefit of additional security and additional guarantees, indemnities or other assurance

<<<

 against loss from any member of the Issuer Group in respect of the Secured Liabilities, provided that, if and to the extent legally possible, such security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss is also granted to the Security

<<<

 Agent as agent and trustee of the other Secured Parties or, in the case of any jurisdiction in which effective Security cannot be granted in favor of the Security Agent as trustee for the Secured Parties, either (i) to the other Secured Parties

<<<

 in respect of the Secured Liabilities or (ii) to the Security Agent under a parallel debt structure, joint and several creditor structure or agency structure for the benefit of the other Secured Parties. Any such additional security, guarantee

<<<

, indemnity or other assurance against loss will rank in the same order of priority as referred to above and the proceeds of the enforcement of any such security, guarantee, indemnity and/or other assurance against loss will be applied as provided

<<<

 below under ``--Application of proceeds from enforcement of Transaction Security."
The Intercreditor Agreement will contemplate the Debtors (or any of them): (i) incurring incremental borrowing liabilities and/or guarantee liabilities under

<<<

, or (ii) refinancing the borrowing liabilities incurred under, the documents creating or evidencing indebtedness under or in respect of any Credit Facility, the Notes, the Hedging Liabilities, the Pari Passu Debt, the Senior Unsecured Notes

<<<

 Liabilities or the Subordinated Liabilities (such documents or instruments, together with the Transaction Security, being
179

referred to collectively as the "Debt Documents") and/or incurring guarantees in respect of any indebtedness incurred

<<<

 in connection with any such refinancing (such incremental borrowing liabilities, refinancing liabilities and/or guarantee liabilities being referred to as ``Additional Indebtedness") which in any such case are intended to rank pari passu with

<<<

 and/or share pari passu in any Transaction Security with any existing liabilities and/or to rank behind any existing liabilities and/or to share in the Transaction Security behind such existing liabilities. The Secured Parties and the creditors

<<<

<<<

 Enforcement Objective");

<<<

 Security Agent in cash for distribution in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (as further described in ``--Application of proceeds from enforcement of Transaction Security"); or

<<<

 action is:

<<<

 enforcement" below) is the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors may waive the requirement for a Financial Advisor's Opinion where sufficient proceeds from the proposed enforcement will be received by the

The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional

<<<

 Intercreditor Agreements (as defined below). The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding relative ranking of indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect of the indebtedness, procedures for

<<<

 undertaking enforcement action, subordination of certain indebtedness, turnover obligations, release of security and guarantees, and the payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security Agent. See `Description of Other Indebtedness--IntercreditorAgreement

" for a description of the material terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.
This ``Description of the Notes' is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of the Notes and the Indenture and refers to the Security Documents and the Intercreditor

General
The Notes

<<<


The Notes will, upon issuance:
 be general senior obligations of the Issuer, secured as set forth under ``--Security
 rankpari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuer that is not subordinated in right

<<<

 of payment to the Notes, including the obligations of the Issuer under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain Hedging Obligations;
 rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuer that is expressly

<<<

 subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;
 be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries that is secured by property and assets that do not secure the Notes, to the

<<<

 extent of the value of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness;
 be guaranteed by the Guarantors; and
 be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of the Issuer that are not Guarantors

<<<

, including obligations to trade creditors.
Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral only after certain super senior priority obligations, including

<<<

 (i) obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility (or any Refinancing Indebtedness of the Revolving Credit Facility that is entitled to rank senior to the Notes with respect to the proceeds of an enforcement of the Collateral) and (ii) certain

<<<

 Hedging Obligations, have been repaid in full.
The Note Guarantees
The Notes will be guaranteed by the Guarantors. In addition, if required by the covenant described under ``--Certain Covenants--Additional Guarantees,'' certain other Restricted

<<<

 Subsidiaries may provide a Note Guarantee (as defined below) in the future.
The Note Guarantee of each Guarantor will each:
 be a general senior obligation of that Guarantor, secured as set forth under "--Security";
 rankpari passu in right

<<<

 of payment with any existing and future Indebtedness of that Guarantor that is not subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee (including Indebtedness Incurred under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain Hedging Obligations

<<<

);
 rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee; and
 be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness

<<<

 or obligation of such Guarantor that is secured by property and assets that do not secure such Note Guarantee, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness.
The obligations of a Guarantor under its Note Guarantee

<<<

 will be limited as necessary to prevent the relevant Note Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance, preference, transfer at under value or unlawful financial assistance under applicable law, or otherwise to reflect limitations under

<<<

 applicable law. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor's obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note Guarantee

<<<

. See ``Risk Factors--Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure--The security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce

<<<

 certain of the Collateral may be restricted by local law." The validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations described in "Certain Insolvency Law and Local Law Limitations

<<<

."
Not all of the Issuer's existing and future Subsidiaries are required to guarantee the Notes and not all of the Issuer's Subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of these non

<<<

-guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Issuer.
194

As of the Issue Date, all of our Subsidiaries

<<<

 will be "Restricted Subsidiaries" for purposes of the Indenture. However, under the circumstances described below under ``--Certain Definitions--Unrestricted Subsidiary,'' we will be permitted to designate certain of our Subsidiaries as "Unrestricted

<<<

 Subsidiaries.'' Our Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture and will not guarantee the Notes.
As of December 31, 2013, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, the Issuer

 Agent shall, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m. (Brussels time) on each Determination Date, determine the Applicable Rate and calculate the aggregate amount of interest payable on the Floating Rate Notes in respect of the following Interest

<<<

 Period (the "Interest Amount"). The Interest Amount shall be calculated by applying the Applicable Rate to the principal amount of the Floating Rate Notes outstanding at the commencement of the Interest Period, multiplying each such amount

<<<

 by the actual number of days in the Interest Period concerned divided by 360. All percentages resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five

<<<

 one-millionths of a percentage point being rounded upwards (e.g., 4.876545% (or .04876545) being rounded to 4.87655% (or .0487655)). All euro amounts used in or resulting from such calculations will be rounded to the nearest euro cent (with

<<<

 one-half euro cent being rounded upwards). The determination of the Applicable Rate and the Interest Amount by the Calculation Agent shall, in the absence of willful default, bad faith or manifest error, be final and binding on all parties

<<<

. In no event will the rate of interest on the Floating Rate Notes be higher than the maximum rate permitted by applicable law; provided, however, that the Calculation Agent shall not be responsible for verifying that the rate of interest on

<<<

 the Floating Rate Notes is permitted under any applicable law.
The rights of Holders to receive the payments of interest on such Notes are subject to applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream. If the due date for any payment in respect

<<<

 of any Notes is not a Business Day at the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to

<<<

 any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.
Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes
Principal, interest and premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Global Notes (as defined below) will be made by one or more

<<<

 Paying Agents by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified by the registered Holder thereof (being the common depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and Clearstream).
Principal, interest and premium, and Additional

<<<

 Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities ("Definitive Registered Notes'') will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents maintained for such purposes in the City of London. In addition, interest on the

<<<

 Definitive Registered
196

Notes may be paid, at the option of the Issuer, by check mailed to the address of the holder entitled thereto as shown on the register of Holders of Notes for the Definitive Registered Notes or by wire transfer where

<<<

 details are available. See ``--Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes.'

Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes
The Issuer will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Notes in the City of London (including the initial Paying Agent)

<<<

. The Issuer will also undertake to maintain a Paying Agent in a European Union member state that will not be obligated to withhold or deduct tax pursuant to the European Union Directive 2003/48/EC or any other directive implementing the conclusions

<<<

 of the ECOFIN meeting of 26 and 27 November 2000 regarding the taxation of savings income (the "Directive"), or any law implementing or complying with or introduced in order to conform to, such Directive. The initial Paying Agent in respect

<<<

 of the Notes will be The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch (the ``Paying Agent").
The Issuer will also maintain a registrar (the ``Registrar^') in Luxembourg, and a transfer agent (the ``Transfer Agent") in the City of London. The initial

<<<

 Registrar will be The Bank of New York Mellon (Luxembourg) S.A. and the initial Transfer Agent will be The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch. The Registrar and Transfer Agent will maintain a register reflecting ownership of the Notes outstanding

<<<

 from time to time, if any, and will make payments on and facilitate transfers of the Notes on behalf of the Issuer.
The Issuer may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent for the Notes without prior notice to the Holders of such

<<<

 Notes. However, for so long as the Notes are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and the rules of the Irish Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish notice of any change of Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent on the official

<<<

 website of the Irish Stock Exchange (www.ise.ie), to the extent and in the manner permitted by the rules of the Irish Stock Exchange. Such notice of the change in a Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent may instead be published in a daily

<<<

 newspaper with general circulation in Ireland (which is expected to be the Irish Times). The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of the Notes.

Note Guarantees
General
The obligations of the Issuer

<<<

 pursuant to the Notes, including any payment obligation resulting from a Change of Control, will be guaranteed, jointly and severally on a senior basis, by the Guarantors (each such guarantee, a "Note Guarantee").

As of and for the year ended December 31, 2013, the Issuer and the Guarantors accounted for approximately 94.6% of the consolidated total assets and 95.3% of the consolidated EBITDA

<<<

 of the Group. For information on the calculation of the figures contained in this paragraph, see the section of this Offering Memorandum entitled ``--Summary--Summary Financial and Operating Information--Summary Other Financial Information

<<<

."

In addition, as described below under ``--Certain Covenants--Additional Guarantees" and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, certain Subsidiaries of the Issuer that guarantee the Revolving Credit Facility in the future or certain other

<<<

 Indebtedness permitted under the Indenture may also be required to enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the Notes and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement.

Each Note Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would

<<<

 not render the Guarantor's obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required to comply with

<<<

 corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor's obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively

<<<

 no obligation under its Note Guarantee. See ``Risk Factors--

197

Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure--The security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the SecurityAgent rather than directly to the holders of the Notes

<<<

. The ability of the SecurityAgent to enforce certain of the Collateral may be restricted by local law," "Risk Factors--Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure--Enforcing your rights as a holder of the Notes or under the Note Guarantees

<<<

 or security across multiple jurisdictions may prove difficult or provide less protection than U.S. bankruptcy law" and "Certain Insolvency Law and Local Law Limitations."
A portion of the operations of the Issuer will be conducted through its

<<<

 Restricted Subsidiaries that will not be Guarantors. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, including trade creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred

<<<

 stockholders (if any) of those Restricted Subsidiaries and minority stockholders of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any) generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Restricted Subsidiaries over the

<<<

 claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including Holders of the Notes. The Notes and each Note Guarantee therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any

<<<

) of Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer (other than the Guarantors) and minority stockholders of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any). As of and for the year ended December 31, 2013, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions

<<<

, non-Guarantors would have had no third-party Indebtedness outstanding. Although the Indenture will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number

<<<

 of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture will not impose any limitation on the Incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture. See

<<<

 ``--Certain Covenants--Limitation on Indebtedness. "
Note Guarantees Release
The Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate and release upon:
 a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the Capital Stock

<<<

 of the relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding company), or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary), if the sale or other

<<<

 disposition does not violate the Indenture and the Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer as a result of the sale or other disposition;
 the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted

<<<

 Subsidiary;
 legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes, as provided in "--Defeasance" and "--Satisfaction and Discharge";
 so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, upon the release

<<<

 of the Guarantor's Note Guarantee under any Indebtedness that triggered such Guarantor's obligation to guarantee the Notes under the covenant described in ``--Certain Covenants--Additional Guarantees";
 in accordance with an enforcement action

<<<

 pursuant to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;
 as described under "--Amendments and Waivers"; or
 as a result of a transaction permitted by ``--Certain Covenants--Merger and Consolidation

<<<

--The Guarantors."
The Trustee shall take all necessary actions reasonably requested by the Issuer, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any

<<<

 release of a Note Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Trustee without the consent of or liability to the Holders

<<<

 or any other action or consent on the part of the Trustee.
Transfer and Exchange
The Notes will be issued in the form of several registered notes in global form without interest coupons, as follows:
 each series of Notes sold within the United

<<<

 States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the "144A Global Notes"). The 144A Global

<<<

 Notes
198

will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream; and
 each series of Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation

<<<

 S under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the "Regulation S Global Notes" and, together with the 144A Global Notes, the "Global Notes''). The Regulation

<<<

 S Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.
Ownership of interests in the Global Notes ("Book-Entry Interests")

<<<

 will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear and Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants.
Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions

<<<

 on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under "Transfer Restrictions." In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or participants in Clearstream will be effected

<<<

 by Euroclear and Clearstream pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream and their respective participants.
Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes (the 

<<<

"144A Book-Entry Interests") may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the "Regulation S Book-Entry Interests") denominated in the same currency only upon delivery

<<<

 by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.
Prior to 40 days after the Issue Date, ownership of

<<<

 Regulation S Book-Entry Interests will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or persons who hold interests through Euroclear or Clearstream, and any sale or transfer of such interest to U.S. persons shall not

<<<

 be permitted during such period unless such resale or transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. Subject to the foregoing, Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form

<<<

 of 144A Book- Entry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a "qualified

<<<

 institutional buyer'' within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under "Transfer Restrictions" and in accordance with any applicable

<<<

 securities law of any other jurisdiction.
Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred

<<<

 and will become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests

<<<

 in the Global Note to which it was transferred.
If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of 100,000 principal amount, and integral multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the

<<<

 Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable

<<<

, from the participant which owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer in compliance with

<<<

 applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more fully under ``Transfer Restrictions."
Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued

<<<

 as Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of 100,000 in principal amount and integral multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or exchange

<<<

, the Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, where

<<<

 appropriate, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection

<<<

 with such transfer.
199

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Registrar is not required to register the transfer or exchange of any Notes:
(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Notes;
(2) for a period

<<<

 of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Notes to be redeemed in part;
(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or
(4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn

<<<

) for repurchase in connection with a Change of Control Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer.
The Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agents and the Registrar will be entitled to treat the registered Holder of a Note as the owner thereof for all

<<<

 purposes.
Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries
Immediately after the issuance of the Notes, all the Issuer's Subsidiaries will be Restricted Subsidiaries. However, in the circumstances described below under ``--Certain Definitions

<<<

--Unrestricted Subsidiary,'' the Issuer will be permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture.
Security
General

<<<


On or around the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured, subject to applicable perfection requirements, by a first-ranking security interest in the following Collateral:
1. the shares of the Issuer (prior to an initial public offering of such

<<<

 shares), Paroc Oy Ab, Paroc Panel System Oy Ab, Paroc Sverige AB, Paroc AB, UAB Paroc and Paroc Polska Sp. z o.o.;
2. all bank accounts of the Issuer, Paroc Oy Ab and Paroc Panel System Oy Ab, substantially all bank accounts of UAB Paroc and

<<<

 Paroc Polska Sp. z o.o. and certain bank accounts of Paroc Sverige AB and Paroc AB;
3. mortgages over all real property of Paroc Polska Sp. z o.o and substantially all real property of Paroc Oy Ab, Paroc Panel System Oy Ab, Paroc AB and UAB

<<<

 Paroc;

5. certain intellectual property rights of the Issuer;
6. all receivables of Paroc Sverige AB, Paroc

<<<

 AB and UAB Paroc;
7. certain intragroup receivables of the Issuer;
8. all machinery and equipment of UAB Paroc;
9. all inventory (including, but not limited to, raw materials, manufactured goods, technical materials, spare parts and other)

<<<

 of UAB Paroc in circulation;
10. all movable assets and rights of Paroc Polska Sp. z o.o.; and
11. all third party contracts, agreements or other business arrangements of Paroc AB.
The Collateral will be pledged pursuant to the Security Documents

<<<

 to the Security Agent on behalf of the Holders of the Notes and holders of the other secured obligations that are secured by the Collateral. Any other security interests that may in the future be granted to secure obligations under the Notes

<<<

, any Note Guarantees and the Indenture would also constitute "Collateral.'' The Indenture will provide that the Liens on the Capital Stock of the Issuer will be released upon any shares of the Issuer that are listed upon and from the completion

<<<

 of an Initial Public Offering of the Issuer.
Subject to the terms of the Indenture and the Security Documents, the Issuer and the Guarantors, as the case may be, will be entitled to exercise any and all voting rights and to receive and retain

<<<

 any and all cash dividends, stock dividends, liquidating dividends, non-cash dividends, shares of stock resulting from stock splits or reclassifications, rights issue, warrants, options and other distributions (whether similar or
200

dissimilar

<<<

 to the foregoing) in respect of the shares that are part of the Collateral until the occurrence of certain events described herein.
The Liens on the Collateral will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising under or imposed

<<<

 by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital maintenance or similar

<<<

 laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law. For a brief description of such limitations, see ``Certain Insolvency Law and Local Law Limitations.''
The assets that

<<<

 comprise the Collateral will also secure on a first-ranking basis the Revolving Credit Facility as well as certain Hedging Obligations and any Additional Notes and may also secure certain future Indebtedness, certain of which is entitled to

<<<

 payment from the proceeds of an enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the Notes. The proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders of the Notes.
No appraisals of

<<<

 the Collateral have been made in connection with this Offering of the Notes. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be

<<<

 sold in a short period of time, or at all. See "Risk Factors--Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure--No appraisals of any of the Collateral have been prepared by us or on our behalf in connection with the issuance of the Notes. The Notes

<<<

 will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral that has been granted as security for the Notes and/or the Note Guarantees, and the value of the Collateral securing the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations

<<<

 under the Notes and such Collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances.''
Priority
The relative priority with regard to the security interests in the Collateral that are created by the Security Documents (the "Security Interests

<<<

" and each, a "Security Interest") as between (a) the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, (b) the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations, (c) the Trustee, the Security Agent and the Holders of the Notes under the Indenture

<<<

, and (d) the creditors of certain other Indebtedness permitted to be secured by the Collateral, respectively, is established by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Revolving Credit Facility, the Indenture, the Security Documents and

<<<

 the security documents relating to the Revolving Credit Facility and such Hedging Obligations, which provide, among other things, that the obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain Hedging Obligations and the Notes are secured

<<<

 equally and ratably by first-priority Security Interests; however, under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Holders of Notes will only receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral after certain super senior priority obligations

<<<

 including (i) obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and (ii) certain Hedging Obligations have been paid in full. See `Description of Other Indebtedneess--Intercreditor Agreement." In addition, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreements

<<<

 or Additional Intercreditor Agreements entered into after the Issue Date, the Collateral may be pledged to secure other Indebtedness. See ``--Release of Liens," "--Certain Covenants--No Impairment of Security Interest" and "--Certain Definitions

<<<

--Permitted Collateral Liens."
Security Documents
Under the Security Documents, the Issuer and the Guarantors will grant security over the Collateral to secure the payment when due of the Issuer's and the Guarantors' payment obligations under

<<<

 the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Indenture. The Security Documents will be entered into by the relevant security provider and the Security Agent as agent for the secured parties. When entering into the Security Documents, the Security

<<<

 Agent will act in its own name, but for the benefit of the secured parties (including itself, the Trustee and the Holders of Notes from time to time). Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent will also act as an agent of the lenders

<<<

 under the Revolving Credit Facility and the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations in relation to the Security Interests created in favor of such parties.
The Indenture will provide that, to the extent permitted by applicable law

<<<

, only the Security Agent will have the right to enforce the Security Documents on behalf of the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes. As a consequence of such contractual provisions, Holders of the Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement

<<<

 action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee under the Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent.
201

The Indenture will provide that

<<<

, subject to the terms thereof and of the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes and the Indenture, as applicable, will be secured by Security Interests in the Collateral until all obligations under the Notes and the Indenture

<<<

 have been discharged. However, the Security Interests with respect to the Notes and the Indenture may be released under certain circumstances as provided under "--Release of Liens"
In the event that the Issuer or its Subsidiaries enter into

<<<

 insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings, the Security Interests created under the Security Documents or the rights and obligations enumerated in the Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to

<<<

 the validity of the Security Interests or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement was successful, the Holders may not be able to recover any amounts under the Security Documents. See "Risk Factors--Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure

<<<

."
Enforcement of Security Interest
The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will restrict the ability of the Holders or the Trustee to enforce the Security Interests and provide for the release of the Security Interests created by the

<<<

 Security Documents in certain circumstances upon enforcement by the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility or certain hedge counterparties. These limitations are described under "Description of Other Indebtedneess--Intercreditor Agreement

<<<

" and "Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests." The ability to enforce may also be restricted by similar arrangements in relation to future Indebtedness that is secured on the Collateral

<<<

 in compliance with the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.
Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound
The Indenture will provide that the Issuer and the Trustee will be authorized (without any

<<<

 further consent of the holders of the Notes) to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement to give effect to the provisions described in the section entitled ``Description of Other Indebtedneess--Intercreditor Agreement."
The Indenture will also

<<<

 provide that each Holder of the Notes, by accepting such Note, will be deemed to have:
1. appointed and authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor

<<<

 Agreements and the Security Documents;
2. agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents; and
3. irrevocably appointed the Security Agent and the Trustee

<<<

 to act on its behalf to enter into and comply with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents.
See the sections entitled "Risk Factors--Risks Related to the Notes and Our

<<<

 Structure--The security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce certain of the Collateral may be restricted by local law

<<<

" and "Description of Other Indebtedneess--Intercreditor Agreement."
Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below) entered into in compliance with the covenant described

<<<

 under ``--Certain Covenants-- Additional Intercreditor Agreements."
Release of Liens
Release of the Security Interests in respect of the Collateral will be permitted under any one or more of the following circumstances:
1. only with respect

<<<

 to the Security Interests on the Capital Stock of the Issuer, at any time immediately preceding or after completion of an Initial Public Offering in which the Issuer is the IPO Entity;
2. in connection with any sale or other disposition of

<<<

 Collateral to a Person that is not the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction subject to "--Certain Covenants--Merger and Consolidation"), if such sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant described under

<<<

 "--Certain Covenants--Limitation on Sale ofAssets and Subsidiary Stock" or is otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture;
3. in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Note Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the Indenture

<<<

, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor;
4. as described under "--Amendments and Waivers";
202

5. upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or legal defeasance

<<<

, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes, as provided in ``--Defeasance'' and "--Satisfaction and Discharge";
6. if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the

<<<

 applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary;
7. to effect a Permitted Reorganization; or
8. as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture.
In addition

<<<

, the Security Interests created by the Security Documents will be released (a) in accordance with an enforcement action pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (b) as may be permitted by the covenant

<<<

 described under ``--Certain Covenants--No Impairment of Security Interest."
The Security Agent and the Trustee (but only if required) will take all necessary action reasonably requested by the Issuer to effectuate any release of Collateral

<<<

 securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security Document. Each of the releases set forth above shall

<<<

 be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the Holders or any action on the part of the Trustee (unless action is required by it to effect such release).

5. On and after May 15, 2015, the Issuer may redeem all or, from time to time, part of the Floating Rate Notes upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days' notice, at the following redemption prices (expressed as a percentage of principal amount

<<<

) plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest

Redemption Price

In addition, prior to May 15, 2015, the

<<<

 Issuer may redeem all or, from time to time, a part of the Floating Rate Notes upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days' notice at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Floating Rate Notes, as the case may be, plus

<<<

 the Applicable Floating Rate Premium and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest

<<<

 due on the relevant interest payment date).

General
We may repurchase the Notes at any time and from time to time in the open market or otherwise. Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth below under ``--Selection and Notice."
If

<<<

 the Issuer effects an optional redemption of Notes, it will, for so long as Notes are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and the rules of the Irish Stock Exchange so require, inform the Irish Stock Exchange of such optional redemption and confirm

<<<

 the aggregate principal amount of Notes of that series that will remain outstanding immediately after such redemption.
If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment date

<<<

, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by

<<<

 the Issuer.
In connection with any redemption of Notes (including with the proceeds from an Equity Offering, to the extent applicable), any such redemption may, at the Issuer's discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent. Unless

<<<

 the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.

Sinking Fund
The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption

<<<

 payments or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes.

Selection and Notice
If less than all of the Notes is to be redeemed at any time, the Paying Agent or the Registrar will select Notes for redemption on apro rata basis (or based

<<<

 on a method that most nearly approximates apro rata selection as the Paying Agent or the Registrar deems fair and appropriate), unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange or depository requirements. Neither the Paying Agent

<<<

 nor the Registrar will be liable for any selections made by it in accordance with this paragraph.

204

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and the rules of the Irish Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer shall

<<<

 publish notice of redemption in a daily newspaper with general circulation in Ireland (which is expected to be the Irish T im e s) and in addition to such publication, not less than 10 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, mail

<<<

 such notice to Holders of the Fixed Rate Notes by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at their respective addresses as they appear on the registration books of the Registrar. Such notice of redemption may instead be published on the website

<<<

 of the Irish Stock Exchange (w w w .ise .ie ).
If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. In the case of a Definitive

<<<

 Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of any Definitive Registered Note redeemed in part will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Definitive

<<<

 Registered Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Global Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption

<<<

 notice, Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of Notes called

<<<

 for redemption.
Redemption for Taxation Reasons
The Issuer may redeem the Fixed Rate Notes or the Floating Rate Notes, as applicable, in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than 10 nor more than 60 days' prior notice to

<<<

 the Holders of the applicable series of Notes (which notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption (a ``Tax

<<<

 Redemption Date'') (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts (as defined below under ``--W ith h o ld in g T axes"), if any

<<<

, then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if the Issuer determines in good faith that, as a result of:
(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations

<<<

 or rulings promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation; or
(2) any amendment to, or change in an official application, administration or written interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations

<<<

 or rulings (including by reason of a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice) (each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a ``C h a n g e in Tax L a w " ),
a Payor

<<<

 (as defined below) is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the applicable series of Notes would be, required to pay Additional Amounts with respect to the applicable series of Notes (but, in the case of a Guarantor, only if the

<<<

 payment giving rise to such requirement cannot be made by the Issuer or another Guarantor who can make such payment without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts), and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available

<<<

 to the Payor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable). Such Change in Tax Law must be publicly announced and become effective on or after the Issue Date (or if the applicable

<<<

 Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date). The foregoing provisions shall apply (a) to a Guarantor only after such time as such Guarantor is obligated to make at least

<<<

 one payment on the Notes and (b) m u ta tis m u ta n d is to any successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture, with respect to a Change in Tax Law occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a party

<<<

 to the Indenture.
Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described under ``--S electio n a n d N o tic e ." Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given earlier

<<<

 than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment of Additional Amounts. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of the applicable series of Notes pursuant to the foregoing

<<<

, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer's Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right so to redeem have been satisfied

<<<

 and that the Payor cannot avoid its obligation to pay Additional Amounts by taking reasonable measures available to it and (b) a written opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing qualified under the laws of the Relevant Taxing

<<<

 Jurisdiction and reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) to the effect that the Payor has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a
205

result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee

<<<

 will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer's Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding

<<<

 on the Holders.
Withholding Taxes
All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (including any successor entity) (each, a "Payor") in respect of the Notes or with respect to any Note Guarantee, as applicable, will be made

<<<

 free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied

<<<

 by or on behalf of:
(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note or any Note Guarantee is made or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (including the jurisdiction

<<<

 of the Paying Agent); or
(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes, or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental

<<<

 authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1) and (2), a "Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction'7),
will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor or the Paying Agent with

<<<

 respect to any Note or any Note Guarantee, including payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts (the ``Additional Amounts") as may be necessary

<<<

 in order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments, after such withholding, deduction or imposition (including any such withholding, deduction or imposition from such Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which

<<<

 would have been received in respect of such payments on any such Note or Note Guarantee in the absence of such withholding, deduction or imposition; provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:
(

<<<

1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former connection between the relevant Holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member, partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power over

<<<

 the relevant Holder, if the relevant Holder is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being resident for tax purposes, or being

<<<

 a citizen or resident or national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in, or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the

<<<

 acquisition, ownership or holding of such Note or the receipt of any payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Note, the Indenture or a Note Guarantee;
(2) any Tax that is imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the

<<<

 Holder or the beneficial owner of the Note to comply with a reasonable written request of the Payor addressed to the Holder or beneficial owner, as applicable, after reasonable notice (at least 30 days before any such withholding or deduction

<<<

 would be payable), to provide certification, information, documents or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other

<<<

 reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from all or part of such Tax but only to the extent

<<<

 the Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to provide such certification or documentation;
(3) any Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes were imposed as a result of the presentation of the Note for payment (where Notes are in the form

<<<

 of Definitive Registered Notes and presentation is required) more than 30 days after the later of the applicable payment date or the date the relevant payment is first made available for payment to the Holder (except to the extent that the

<<<

 Holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Note been presented on the last day of such 30 day period);
(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment of the principal of, premium

<<<

, if any, or interest, if any, on the Notes or with respect to any Note Guarantee;
(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;
206

(6) any Taxes that are required to be deducted or withheld

<<<

 on a payment to an individual pursuant to the Directive or any law implementing, or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such Directive;
(7) any Taxes imposed in connection with a Note presented for payment by or on behalf

<<<

 of a Holder or beneficial owner who would have been able to avoid such Tax by presenting the relevant Note to another, and accepting payment from such other, Paying Agent in a member state of the European Union;
(8) any Taxes imposed, deducted

<<<

 or withheld pursuant to section 1471(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or otherwise imposed pursuant to sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, in each case, as of the Issue Date (and any amended or successor

<<<

 version that is substantially comparable), any current or future regulations or agreements thereunder, official interpretations thereof or any law implementing an intergovernmental agreement relating thereto;
or any combination of the preceding

<<<

 clauses (1) through (8) above.
In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership or any person other than the beneficial owner of the Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary or settler

<<<

 with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or beneficial owner held such Notes directly.
The Payor will (i

<<<

) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will provide certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment

<<<

 of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, or if such tax receipts are not available, certified copies of other reasonable evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to

<<<

 the Trustee. Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon reasonable request and will be made available at the offices of the Paying Agent.
If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment

<<<

 made on any Note or any Note Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to

<<<

 be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant

<<<

 payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer's Certificate as promptly as practicable thereafter). The Trustee shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer's Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary

<<<

.
Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this "Description of the Notes' there is mentioned, in any context:
1. the payment of principal;
2. purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Notes;
3. interest; or
4. any other amount payable

<<<

 on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Note Guarantee,
such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

<<<


The Payor will pay and indemnify the Holder for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto) or any other excise

<<<

, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, issuance, delivery, initial resale, registration, enforcement

<<<

 of, or receipt of payments with respect to any Notes, any Note Guarantee, the Indenture, or any other document or instrument in relation thereto (other than in each case, in connection with a transfer of the Notes after this Offering).
The

<<<

 foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, any transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to a Payor is incorporated

<<<

 or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with respect to
207

the Notes (or any Note Guarantee) is made by or on behalf of such

 Payor, or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.
Change of Control
If a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms of the covenant described under this heading ``-- C h a n g e o f C o n tr o l" each

<<<

 Holder will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part (equal to 100,000 or integral multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof; p r o v id e d that Notes of 100,000 or less may only be redeemed in whole and not in part) of

<<<

 such Holder's Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record

<<<

 on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); p r o v id e d , h o w e v e r, that the Issuer shall not be obligated to repurchase Notes as described under this heading, "C h an ge o f C o n tr

<<<

 o l" in the event and to the extent that it has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all of the Notes of such series and given notice of redemption as described under ``--O p tio n a l R e d e m p tio n " and that all conditions to

<<<

 such redemption have been satisfied or waived.
Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes and given notice of redemption as described under "--O p tio n a l R e d e m p tio n " and all conditions to such

<<<

 redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control, the Issuer will mail a notice (the "C h a n g e o f C o n tro l O ffe r") to each Holder of any such Notes, with a copy to the Trustee

<<<

:
1. stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to require the Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder's Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of

<<<

 such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) 

<<<

(the "C h a n g e o f C o n tro l P a y m e n t" );
2. stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed) and the record date (the "C h a n g e o f C o n tro l P a

<<<

 y m e n t D a te ");
3. stating that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date unless the Change of Control Payment is not paid, and that any Notes

<<<

 or part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue interest;
4. describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control;
5. describing the procedures determined by the

<<<

 Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder must follow in order to have its Notes repurchased; and
6. if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control Offer is conditional

<<<

 on the occurrence of such Change of Control.
On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful:
1. accept for payment all Notes or portion thereof properly tendered pursuant

<<<

 to the Change of Control Offer;
2. deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes so tendered;
3. deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate stating the aggregate

<<<

 principal amount of Notes or portions of the Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer;
4. in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) the Global Notes

<<<

 in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer; and
5. in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar

<<<

 for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer.
208

If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the

<<<

 Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) will, at the cost of the Issuer, promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes

<<<

 a new Definitive Registered Note equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; p r o v id e d that each such new Note will be in a principal amount that is at least 100,000 and integral multiples of

<<<

 1,000 in excess thereof.
For so long as the Notes are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and the rules of such exchange so require, the Issuer will publish notices relating to the Change of Control Offer in a daily newspaper with general circulation

<<<

 in Ireland (which is expected to be the Irish T im e s) or to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such notices on the official website of the Irish Stock Exchange (w w w .ise.ie).
Except as described above with respect

<<<

 to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a Holders

<<<

' right to require the Issuer to repurchase Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control.
The Issuer

<<<

 will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable

<<<

 to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made

<<<

 in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place providing for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made.
The Issuer will comply

<<<

, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any

<<<

 securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions

<<<

 of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.
The Issuer's ability to repurchase Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change

<<<

 of Control would require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control under the Revolving Credit Facility and require a mandatory prepayment

<<<

 of Indebtedness under such agreement may not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control

<<<

 or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness

<<<

, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer's ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer's then existing financial

<<<

 resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See ``R is k F a c to rs-- R is k s R e la te d to th e N o te s a n d O u r S tru c tu re -- W e m a y n o t h a

The

<<<

 definition of ``Change of Control'' includes a disposition, in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other

<<<

 Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase ``substantially all,'' there is no precise established definition of the phrase ``substantially all'' under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances

<<<

 there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of ``all or substantially all'' of the property and assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result,

<<<

 it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.
209

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer's obligation

<<<

 to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Notes.

 be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness

<<<

 does not exceed the amount set forth in clause (2) of the definition of Refinancing Indebtedness; (b) the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a Restricted

 Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred

 in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such

 refinancing.

 agent), upon delivery of an Officer's Certificate from the Issuer, will authenticate and mail or deliver (or cause to be transferred by book entry) such new Note to such Holder, in a principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion of the

 Note surrendered; p r o v id e d that each such new Note will be in a principal amount with a minimum denomination of 100,000. Any Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred by book entry) by the Issuer to the

 Holder thereof.
The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to the Indenture.

Merger and Consolidation
The Issuer
The Issuer will not, directly or indirectly, consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all

<<<

 or substantially all its assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions to, any Person, unless:
(1) either (i) the Issuer is the surviving entity or (ii) the resulting, surviving

<<<

 or transferee Person (the "Successor Company'') will be a Person organized and existing under the laws of any member state of the European Union, any State of the United States of America or the District of Columbia, Canada or any province

<<<

 of Canada, Norway or Switzerland and the Successor Company (if not the Issuer) will expressly assume, (a) by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations

<<<

 of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture and (b) all obligations of the Issuer under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable;
(2) immediately after giving effect to

<<<

 such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the Successor Company as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Subsidiary

<<<

 at the time of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;
(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Issuer or the Successor Company would be able to Incur at least

<<<

 an additional 1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under "--L im ita tio n o n In d e b te d n e s s "; or (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Issuer or the Successor Company for the most recently

<<<

(

<<<

4) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each to the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any is required in connection with such

<<<

 transaction) comply with the Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental indenture (if any) has been duly authorized, executed and delivered and is a legal, valid and binding agreement enforceable against the Successor

<<<

 Company (in each case, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee), p r o v id e d that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer's Certificate as to any matters of fact.
Any Indebtedness that becomes

<<<

 an obligation of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (or that is deemed to be Incurred by any Restricted Subsidiary that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) as a result of any such transaction undertaken in compliance with this covenant, and

<<<

 any Refinancing Indebtedness with respect thereto, shall be deemed to have been Incurred in compliance with the covenant described under ``-- L im ita tio n o n I n d e b te d n e s s ."
For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance

<<<

, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Issuer, which properties and assets, if held by the Issuer instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute

<<<

 all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer.
The Successor Company will succeed to, and

<<<

 be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Issuer under the Indenture but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets, the predecessor company will not be released from its obligations under the Indenture

<<<

 or the Notes.
There is no precise established definition of the phrase ``substantially all'' under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve

<<<

 ``all or substantially all'' of the property or assets of a Person.
227

The G uarantors
No Guarantor (other than a Guarantor whose Note Guarantee is to be released in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement

<<<

 or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) may:
(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person (whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving corporation);
(2) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of, all or substantially

<<<

 all its assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to any Person; or
(3) permit any Person to merge with or into it unless:
(a) . the other Person is the Issuer or any Restricted

<<<

 Subsidiary that is a Guarantor or becomes a Guarantor substantially concurrently with such consolidation, merger, sale assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposal;
(b) . (1) either (x) a Guarantor is the continuing Person or 

<<<

(y) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Guarantor under its Note Guarantee and the Indenture (pursuant to a supplemental indenture executed and delivered in a form reasonably satisfactory

<<<

 to the Trustee) and all obligations of the Guarantor under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable; and (2) immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default

<<<

 or Event of Default shall have occurred and is continuing; or
(c) . the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of a Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all

<<<

 the assets of a Guarantor (in each case other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the Indenture.
The provisions set forth in this ``Merger and Consolidation" covenant shall not restrict (and shall not apply

<<<

 to): (i) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor from consolidating with, merging or liquidating into or transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Issuer, a Guarantor or any other Restricted Subsidiary

<<<

 that is not a Guarantor (p r o v id e d that a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor and that has Incurred Indebtedness pursuant to clause (5) of the second paragraph of the covenant described above under ``--L im ita tio n o n In d

<<<

 e b te d n e s s " may only merge into or transfer all or substantially all its properties and assets to another such Restricted Subsidiary); (ii) any Guarantor from merging or liquidating into or transferring all or part of its properties

<<<

 and assets to the Issuer or another Guarantor; (iii) any consolidation or merger of the Issuer into any Guarantor;p r o v id e d that, if the Issuer is not the surviving entity of such merger or consolidation, the relevant Guarantor will assume

<<<

 the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents and clauses (1) and (4) under the heading ``--T he Issu e r" shall apply to such transaction

<<<

; and (iv) the Issuer or any Guarantor consolidating into or merging or combining with an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of such entity, reincorporating such entity in another jurisdiction

<<<

, or changing the legal form of such entity; p r o v id e d , h o w e v e r, that clauses (1), (2) and (4) under the heading "--T h e Issu e r" or clause (3) under the heading ``-- T he G u a r a n to r s " as the case may be, shall apply to

<<<

 any such transaction.
No Impairment of Security Interest
The Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or knowingly or negligently omit to take any action that would have the result of materially impairing the

<<<

 Security Interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood, subject to the proviso below, that the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the Security Interest with respect

<<<

 to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and the Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders

<<<

 and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral, except that (i) the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries

<<<

 may Incur Permitted Collateral Liens and the Collateral may be discharged and released in accordance with the Indenture, the applicable Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (ii) the

<<<

 applicable Security Documents may be amended from time to time to cure any ambiguity, mistake,
228

omission, defect, manifest error or inconsistency therein; provided, however, that in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) above, except with respect

<<<

 to any discharge or release in accordance with the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents may not be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released or otherwise

<<<

 modified or replaced, unless contemporaneously with any such action, the Issuer delivers to the Trustee, either (1) a solvency opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee from an Independent Financial Advisor confirming

<<<

 the solvency of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, (2) a certificate from

<<<

 the Board of Directors of the relevant Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, which confirms the solvency of the Person granting such Security Interest, after giving effect to any transactions related to such

<<<

 amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, or (3) an Opinion of Counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions

<<<

 related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the Security Documents, so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released, modified

<<<

 or replaced are valid Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement

<<<

, supplement, release, modification or replacement. In the event that the Issuer complies with the requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to each of the Trustee and the Security Agent being indemnified

<<<

 and secured to its satisfaction) consent to such amendments without the need for instructions from the Holders.
Additional Guarantees
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this covenant, no Restricted Subsidiary shall Guarantee the Indebtedness

<<<

 outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, any Credit Facility or any other Public Debt, in each case, of the Issuer or a Guarantor unless such Restricted Subsidiary is or becomes a Guarantor on the date on which such Guarantee is Incurred

<<<

 and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Note Guarantee, which Note Guarantee will be senior to or pari

<<<

 passu with such Restricted Subsidiary's Guarantee of such other Indebtedness; provided, however, that such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be obligated to become such a Guarantor to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Note

<<<

 Guarantee could give rise to or result in:
(1) any breach or violation of statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination

<<<

 rules or the laws rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction, which, in any case, cannot be prevented or otherwise avoided through measures reasonably available to the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiary

<<<

 (including ``whitewash'' or similar procedures);
(2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a

<<<

 Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or
(3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) to the extent such cost, expense, liability

<<<

 or obligation is disproportionate to the benefit obtained by the Holders with respect to the receipt of the guarantee (as determined in good faith by the Issuer); provided that this clause (3) shall not be applicable to reasonable out of pocket

<<<

 expenses;
provided, that the Issuer will procure that the relevant Restricted Subsidiary becomes a Guarantor at such time as such restriction would no longer apply to the providing of the Note Guarantee or no longer would prohibit such Restricted

<<<

 Subsidiary from becoming a Guarantor (or prevent the Issuer from causing such Restricted Subsidiary to become a Guarantor).
At the option of the Issuer, any Note Guarantee may contain limitations on Guarantor liability to the extent reasonably

<<<

 necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws,

<<<

 regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.
229

Future Note Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under "--R elea ses o f th e N

<<<

 o te G u a r a n te e s " A Note Guarantee of a future Guarantor may also be released at the option of the Issuer if at the date of such release there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue Date

<<<

 and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Indenture if such Guarantor had not been designated as a Guarantor. The Trustee and the Security Agent shall each take all necessary actions, including the granting of releases or

<<<

 waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Note Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to each of the Trustee and the Security Agent being indemnified

<<<

 and secured to its satisfaction.
The validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests and the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations as described and set out in "R is k F a cto rs-- R isk

Payments for Consent
The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary

<<<

 to, directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any consideration to or for the benefit of any holder of Notes for or as an inducement to any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms of the provisions of the Indenture or the Notes

<<<

 unless such consideration is offered to be paid and is paid to all holders of the Notes that consent, waive or agree to amend in the time frame set forth in the solicitation documents relating to such consent, waiver or agreement. Notwithstanding

<<<

 the foregoing, the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries shall be permitted, in any offer or payment of consideration for, or as an inducement to, any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of the Indenture or the Notes

<<<

, to exclude Holders of Notes in any jurisdiction where the solicitation of such consent, waiver or amendment, including in connection with an offer to purchase for cash, or the payment of the consideration therefor, would require the Issuer

<<<

 or any Restricted Subsidiary to file a registration statement, prospectus or similar document under any applicable securities laws (including, but not limited to, the United States federal securities laws and the laws of the European Union

<<<

 or its member states), which the Issuer in its sole discretion determines (acting in good faith) (x) would be materially burdensome (it being understood that it would not be materially burdensome to file the consent document(s) used in other

<<<

 jurisdictions, any substantially similar documents or any summary thereof with the securities or financial services authorities in such jurisdiction); or (y) such solicitation would otherwise not be permitted under applicable law in such jurisdiction

<<<

.
Maintenance of Listing
The Issuer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain the listing of the Notes on the Irish Stock Exchange for so long as the Notes are outstanding; p r o v id e d that if the Issuer is unable

<<<

 to obtain admission to listing of the Notes on the Irish Stock Exchange or if at any time the Issuer determines that it will not maintain such listing, it will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain a listing of such

<<<

 Notes on another "recognised stock exchange" as defined in Section 1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007 of the United Kingdom.
Further Assurances
The Issuer will, and will procure that each of its Subsidiaries will, at its own expense, execute and

<<<

 do all such acts and things and provide such assurances as the Security Agent may reasonably require (1) for registering any Security Documents in any required register and for perfecting or protecting the security intended to be afforded by

<<<

 such Security Documents; and (2) if such Security Documents have become enforceable, for facilitating the realization of all or any part of the assets which are subject to such Security Documents and for facilitating the exercise of all powers

<<<

, authorities and discretions vested in the Security Agent or in any receiver of all or any part of those assets. The Issuer will, and will procure that each of its Subsidiaries will, execute all transfers, conveyances, assignments and releases

<<<

 of that property whether to the Security Agent or to its nominees and give all notices, orders and directions which the Security Agent may reasonably request.

Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status
If on any

<<<

 date following the Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a ``Suspension Event"), then, beginning on that day and continuing until such time, if any, at

<<<

 which the Notes cease to have Investment Grade Status (the ``Reversion Date"), the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the following captions will not apply to the Notes:
(1) ``--L im ita tio n o n R e s tr ic te d P a y m e n ts 

<<<

";
(2) ``--L im ita tio n o n I n d e b te d n e s s ";
(3) ``--L im ita tio n o n R e s tr ic tio n s o n D is tr ib u tio n s f r o m R e s tr ic te d S u b s id ia r ie s ";

(7) the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under ``--M erg er

<<<

 a n d
C onsolidation-- The Issu e r"
and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be applicable to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries.
Such covenants and any related default

<<<

 provisions will again apply according to their terms from the first day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard to actions of the Issuer properly taken during the continuance

<<<

 of the Suspension Event, and no action taken prior to the Reversion Date will constitute a Default or Event of Default. The "Limitation on Restricted Payments" covenant will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of the Indenture

<<<

 but not during the continuance of the Suspension Event. On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted

<<<

 under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under ``--L im ita tio n o n I n d e b te d n e s s ." In addition, the Indenture will also permit, without causing a Default or Event of Default, the Issuer or any of the

<<<

 Restricted Subsidiaries to honor any contractual commitments or take actions in the future after any date on which the Notes cease to have an Investment Grade Status as long as the contractual commitments were entered into during the Suspension

<<<

 Event and not in anticipation of the Notes no longer having an Investment Grade Status. The Issuer shall notify the Trustee in writing that the conditions set forth in the first paragraph under this caption has been satisfied, p ro v id e d

<<<

 that, no such notification shall be a condition for the suspension of the covenants described under this caption to be effective. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade Status.
Events of Default

<<<


Each of the following is an ``Event of Default" under the Indenture:
(1) default in any payment of interest on any Note issued under the Indenture when due and payable, continued for 30 days;
(2) default in the payment of the principal amount

<<<

 of or premium, if any, on any Note issued under the Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise;
(3) failure by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries

<<<

 to comply for 60 days after notice by the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes with its other agreements contained in the Indenture;
(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under

<<<

 which there may be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries

<<<

) other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the Issue Date, which default:
(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at stated maturity on such

<<<

 Indebtedness, immediately upon the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness (``p a y m e n t d e fa u lt"); or
231

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the "cro ss a ccelera tio n

 so accelerated, aggregates 20.0 million or more or (ii) such Indebtedness is secured by a Permitted Collateral Lien and Incurred pursuant to clause (1) or (6) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under "--C e rta in C o v e n a

 Senior Secured Creditors (as defined therein) have determined in good faith that to enter into consultation could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent's ability to enforce any of the Collateral or the

 or any Guarantor denies or disaffirms in writing its obligations under its Note Guarantee and any such Default continues for 10 days.
If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is continuing

<<<

, the Trustee by notice to the Issuer, or, the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the request of such Holders shall

<<<

, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes under the Indenture to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable

 immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (4) under ``-- E v e n ts o f D e fa u lt" has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes

 shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise

 to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree

 of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, except non-payment of principal, premium or interest on the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived.

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other

<<<

 act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.
Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and

<<<

 the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.
The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture by notice to the Trustee may, on behalf of all Holders, waive all past or existing

<<<

 Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to non-payment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict

<<<

 with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.
Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to

<<<

 exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense

<<<

. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:
(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default

<<<

 is continuing;
(2) Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy;
(3) such Holders have offered the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability

<<<

 or expense;
(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of such security or indemnity; and
(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have

<<<

 not given the Trustee a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.
Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are

<<<

 given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.
The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of

<<<

 Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction

<<<

 that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee

<<<

 will be entitled to indemnification or security satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and

<<<

 the Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium

<<<

, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the

<<<

 end of each fiscal year, an Officer's Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after

<<<

 the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.
The Indenture will provide that (i

<<<

) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a report or a required certificate in connection with another default (an "Initial Default") then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required

<<<

 certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled ``--Certain Covenants

<<<

--Reports" or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of this Indenture shall be
233

deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable

<<<

, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture.
The Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified or

<<<

 secured to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity

<<<

 to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly.
Amendments and Waivers
Subject to certain exceptions, the Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal

<<<

 amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may

<<<

 be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes). However, without

<<<

 the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% (or, in the case of clause (8), 75%) of the then outstanding principal amount of the Notes affected, an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder

<<<

:
(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, waiver or modification;
(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any Note;
(3) reduce the principal of, or extend

<<<

 the Stated Maturity of, any Note;
(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Note or change the time at which any Note may be redeemed, in each case as described under ``--Optional Redemption";
(5) make any Note payable in money

<<<

 other than that stated in the Note;
(6) impair the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on such Holder's Notes on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement

<<<

 of any such payment on or with respect to such Holder's Notes;
(7) make any change in the provision of the Indenture described under ``--Withholding Taxes' that adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Notes in any material respect

<<<

 or amends the terms of such Notes in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described thereunder or an exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described thereunder unless the Issuer agrees

<<<

 to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;
(8) release any security interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral other than in accordance with the terms of the Notes Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement

<<<

, any applicable Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Indenture;
(9) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the non-payment of principal, premium or interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes (except pursuant to a

<<<

 rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);
(10) release any Guarantor from any of its

<<<

 obligations under its Note Guarantee or the Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement; or
(11) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders' consent described

<<<

 in this sentence,
provided, however, that if such amendment or waiver described in clauses (2), (3) and (4) above only affects or would only affect the Fixed Rate Notes or the Floating Rate Notes, and does not or would not affect Holders of

<<<

 the Notes generally, only the consent of the Holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Fixed Rate Notes or Floating Rate Notes (and not the consent of the Holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate

<<<

 principal amount of all Notes then outstanding), as the case may be, shall be required. Notwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed that (a) any matter described in clauses (2), (3) and (4) above

<<<

 that by its terms applies only to the Fixed Rate Notes shall require the consent of the Holders of not less than 90% of the
234

aggregate principal amount of all the then outstanding Fixed Rate Notes in order for it to be binding on all Holders

<<<

 of the Fixed Rate Notes and (b) any matter described in clauses (2), (3) and (4) above that by its terms applies only to the Floating Rate Notes shall require the consent of the Holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount

<<<

 of all the then outstanding Floating Rate Notes in order for it to be binding on all Holders of the Floating Rate Notes.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Security Agent and the other

<<<

 parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Notes Documents to:
(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency;
(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or any Restricted

<<<

 Subsidiary under any Notes Document;
(3) add to the covenants or provide for a Note Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any right or power conferred upon the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;
(4) make any change that would

<<<

 provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders or that does not adversely affect the rights or benefits to the Trustee or any of the Holders in any material respect under the Notes Documents;
(5) make such provisions as

<<<

 necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a member of Senior Management of the Issuer) for the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with the instructions set forth in the Indenture on the Issue Date;
(6) to provide

<<<

 for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Note Guarantee in accordance with the covenant described under "--C e rta in C o v e n a n ts -- L im ita tio n o n I n d e b te d n e s s " or "--A d d it io n a l G u a r a n te e s ,'' to add Guarantees

<<<

 with respect to the Notes, to add security to, or for the benefit of, the Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any Note Guarantee or Lien (including the Collateral and the Security Documents)

<<<

 or any amendment in respect thereof with respect to or securing the Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking or amendment is provided for under the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional

<<<

 Intercreditor Agreement;
(7) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Security Documents or the Notes to any provision of this `D e s c r ip tio n o f th e N o te s ' to the extent that such provision in this "D e sc rip tio n o f th e N o

<<<

 te s " was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the Security Documents or the Notes;
(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional

<<<

 Intercreditor Agreement of a successor Trustee or Security Agent pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee or Security Agent to any Notes Document;
(9) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage

<<<

, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest in favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders or parties to the Revolving Credit Facility, in any property which is required by the Security Documents or the Revolving Credit

<<<

 Facility (as in effect on the Issue Date) to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a security interest is required to be granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a security interest in the Collateral for

<<<

 the benefit of any Person; p r o v id e d that the granting of such security interest is not prohibited by the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the covenant described under "--C e rta in

<<<

 C o v e n a n ts-- N o I m p a ir m e n t o f S ecu rity In te re st" is complied with; or
(10) as provided in ``--C e rta in C o v e n a n ts -- A d d it io n a l I n te r c r e d ito r A g r e e m e n ts ."
In formulating its decision on

<<<

 such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to require and rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems necessary, including Officer's Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.
The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to

<<<

 approve the particular form of any proposed amendment of any Notes Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any Holder of Notes

<<<

 given in connection with a tender of such Holder's Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.
For so long as the Notes are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and the rules of such exchange so require, the Issuer will publish notice

<<<

 of any amendment, supplement and waiver in Ireland in a daily newspaper
235

with general circulation in Ireland (which is expected to be the Irish T im e s). Such notice of any amendment, supplement and waiver may instead be published on

<<<

 the website of the Irish Stock Exchange (w w w .is e .ie ).
Additional or Amended Intercreditor Agreements
The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Issuer, in connection with the Incurrence by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries

<<<

 of any (x) Indebtedness permitted pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under ``--L im ita tio n o n In d e b te d n e s s '' or clause (1), (4), (5), (6), (7) (other than with respect to Capitalized Lease Obligations),

<<<

 (11) or (13) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under "--L im ita tio n o n I n d e b te d n e s s '' and (y) any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of Indebtedness referred to in the foregoing clause (x), the Issuer, the relevant

<<<

 Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized Representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an `Additional Intercreditor Agreement'') or a restatement

<<<

, amendment or other modification of the existing Intercreditor Agreement on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable to the Holders), including containing substantially the same terms

<<<

 with respect to release of Guarantees and priority and release of the Security Interests; p r o v id e d that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion

<<<

 of the Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee or Security Agent under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement. Only one such Intercreditor Agreement shall

<<<

 be outstanding at any one time or, if more than one such Intercreditor Agreement is outstanding at any one time, the collective terms of such Intercreditor Agreements must not conflict and must be no more disadvantageous to the holders of the

<<<

 Notes than if all such Indebtedness was a party to one such agreement.
The Indenture also will provide that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of Holders, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter

<<<

 into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, manifest error or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that

<<<

 may be Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to any such agreement (including with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness

<<<

 ranking junior in right of payment to the Notes), (3) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the Notes (including Additional Notes), (5) make provision for equal

<<<

 and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure Additional Notes, (6) implement any Permitted Collateral Liens, (7) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof or (8) make

<<<

 any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect. In formulating its opinion on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to request and rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems

<<<

 appropriate, including an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel. The Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the Holders

<<<

 of the majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below under ``--A m e n d m e n ts a n d W a ivers," and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into

<<<

 any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities or immunities

<<<

 under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.
The Indenture shall also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee (and Security

<<<

 Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the Holders to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations subordinated to the Notes thereby; p r o v id e d , h o w e v

<<<

 e r, that such transaction would comply with the covenant described under ``--L im ita tio n o n R e str ic te d P a y m e n ts ."
The Indenture also will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and

<<<

 accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein) and to have directed the Trustee

<<<

 and the Security Agent to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement. A copy of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
236

Agreement shall be made available for inspection during normal business hours on any

<<<

 Business Day upon prior written request at our offices or at the offices of the listing agent.
Acts by Holders
In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of the Notes have concurred in any direction, waiver or consent

<<<

, the Notes owned by the Issuer or by any Person directly or indirectly controlled, or controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control with, the Issuer will be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding.
Defeasance
The Issuer at

<<<

 any time may terminate all obligations of the Issuer and each Guarantor under the Notes and the Indenture ("legal defeasance'') and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain obligations, including those respecting

<<<

 the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning issuing temporary Notes, registration of Notes, mutilated

<<<

, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the Notes Security Documents

<<<

 and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time will terminate (other than with respect to the defeasance trust).
The Issuer at any time may terminate

<<<

 its and the Guarantors' obligations under the covenants described under ``--C erta in C o v e n a n ts ' (other than clauses (1), (2) and (4) under "--C e rta in C o v e n a n ts-- M e rg e r a n d C o n s o lid a tio n -- T h e Is su e r"

<<<

) and "C h a n g e o f C o n tr o l" and the default provisions relating to such covenants described under "E v e n ts o f D e fa u lt'' above, the operation of the cross-default upon a payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the

<<<

 bankruptcy provisions with respect to the Significant Subsidiaries, the judgment default provision, the guarantee provision and the security default provision described under ``-- E v e n ts o f D e f a u lt" (``c o v e n a n t d e fe a s a

<<<

 n c e " ).
The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not

<<<

 be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to such Notes. If the Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to the Notes, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified

<<<

 in clause (3) (other than with respect to clauses (1), (2) and (4) of the covenant described under ``--C erta in C o v e n a n ts-- M e rg e r a n d C o n s o lid a tio n -- T h e I s s u e r ") (4), (5) (with respect only to the Significant

<<<

 Subsidiaries), (6), (7) or (8) under "--E v e n ts o f D e f a u lt."
In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the "defeasance trust'') with the Trustee (or another entity designated by the

<<<

 Trustee for this purpose) cash in euros or euro-denominated European Government Obligations or a combination thereof sufficient for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case

<<<

 may be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:
(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States to the effect that Holders and beneficial owners of the relevant Notes will not recognize income, gain

<<<

 or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit

<<<

 and defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel in the United States must be based on a ruling received by the Issuer from, or published by, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other change

<<<

 in applicable U.S. federal income tax law);
(2) an Officer's Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer and, if applicable

<<<

, any Guarantor;
(3) an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or relating to legal defeasance

<<<

 or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with;
237

(4) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the trust resulting from the deposit does not constitute, or is qualified as, a regulated investment company under the U

<<<

.S. Investment Company Act of 1940; and
(5) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee all other documents or other information that the Trustee may reasonably require in connection with either defeasance option.
Satisfaction and Discharge
The Indenture

<<<

, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents will be discharged and cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of conversion

<<<

 or transfer or exchange of the Notes, as expressly provided for in the Indenture) as to all outstanding Notes when (1) either (a) all the Notes previously authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes, and

<<<

 certain Notes for which provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Issuer) have been delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation; or (b) all Notes not previously delivered to the Paying Agent

<<<

 for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee for

<<<

 the giving of notice of redemption by the Paying Agent in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the Issuer has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or another entity designated by the Trustee for this purpose), money

<<<

 or euro-denominated European Government Obligations, or a combination thereof, as applicable, in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Notes not previously delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation, for

<<<

 principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be; (3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other

<<<

 sums payable under the Indenture; (4) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the payment of the notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be

<<<

 and (5) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each to the effect that all conditions precedent under the "Satisfaction and Discharge" section of the Indenture relating to the satisfaction

<<<

 and discharge of the Indenture have been complied with, provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer's Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)).
No Personal Liability

<<<

 of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders
No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer, Issuer

<<<

 or any Guarantor under the Notes Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation.
Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part

<<<

 of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.
Concerning the Trustee and

<<<

 Certain Agents
The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Trustee will perform only such duties as

<<<

 are set forth specifically in the Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same degree of care that a prudent Person would use

<<<

 in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty.
The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights

<<<

 of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of the Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee or any Agent will be permitted

<<<

 to engage in other transactions with the Issuer and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries. If the Trustee or any Agent becomes the Holder, beneficial owner or pledgee of any Notes, it may deal with the Issuer with the same rights it would have if

<<<

 it were not the Trustee, Paying Agent or any other such Agent.
238

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and replaced. Such terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed

<<<

 at any time by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Issuer and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest

<<<

 that is not eliminated, or (b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less than six months may petition any court

<<<

 for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.
Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee.
The Indenture will contain provisions for

<<<

 the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, Taxes or expenses Incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture

<<<

.
Notices
For so long as any of the Notes are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and the rules of the Irish Stock Exchange so require, notices of the Issuer with respect to the Notes will be published on the website of the Irish Stock Exchange

<<<

 (www.ise.ie). In addition, for so long as any Notes are represented by Global Notes, all notices to Holders of the Notes will be delivered by or on behalf of the Issuer to Euroclear and Clearstream. Such notices may instead be published in

<<<

 entitled to receive definitive Notes in registered form (the ``D e fin itiv e R eg istered N o te s "). The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of Notes take physical

 possession of such Notes in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair your ability to own, transfer, pledge or grant any other security interest in Book-Entry Interests.
So long as the Global Notes are in global form, holders of

 Notes to persons in jurisdictions that require physical delivery of securities or to pledge such Notes, such holder must transfer its interests in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for

Definitive Registered Notes
Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of Book-Entry Interests will receive Definitive Registered Notes only in the following circumstances:
(1) if either Euroclear or

 Clearstream notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days;
(2) if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing

 delivered through either Euroclear or Clearstream following an Event of Default which results in action by the Trustee pursuant to the enforcement provisions under the Indenture.
Euroclear has advised the Issuer that upon request by an owner

<<<

 of a Book- Entry Interest described in the immediately preceding clause (2), its current procedure is to request that Definitive Registered Notes be issued to all owners of Book-Entry Interests and not only to the owner who made the initial

<<<

 request.
In any such events described in clause (1) or (2), the Registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream

<<<

, as applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and certain certification requirements and based upon directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of the Book-Entry Interests). The Definitive

<<<

 Registered Notes will bear a restrictive legend with respect to certain transfer restrictions, unless that legend is not required by the Indenture or by applicable law.
274

In the case of the issue of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder

<<<

 of a Definitive Registered Note may transfer such Definitive Registered Note by surrendering it to the registrar. In the event of a partial transfer or a partial redemption of one Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note

<<<

 will be issued to the transferee in respect of the part transferred, and a new Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferor or the holder, as applicable in respect of the balance of the holding not transferred or redeemed, provided

<<<

 that a Definitive Registered Note will only be issued in denominations of 100,000 or in integral multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof.
If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered Notes

<<<

 have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Notes are mutilated and are surrendered to the Registrar or at the office of a transfer agent, we will issue and the Trustee or an authenticating agent appointed

<<<

 by the trustee will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the Trustee's and our requirements are met. We or the Trustee may require a holder requesting replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond

<<<

 sufficient in the judgment of both the Trustee and us to protect us, the Trustee or the Paying Agent appointed pursuant to the Indenture from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. We may charge for

<<<

 expenses in replacing a Definitive Registered Note.
In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by us pursuant to

<<<

 the provisions of the Indenture governing the Notes, we in our discretion may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.
Definitive Registered Notes may

<<<

 be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests only in accordance with the Indenture and, if required, only after the transferor first delivers to the Transfer Agent a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to

<<<

 the effect that such transfer will comply with the transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See ``Notice to Investors
Payment of principal, any repurchase price, premium and interest on Definitive Registered Notes will be payable at

<<<

 the office of the Issuer's Paying Agent in Ireland so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on Global Exchange Market of that exchange and the rules and regulations of such exchange

<<<

 so require.
To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner thereof.
The Issuer will not

<<<

 impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, holders of the Book-Entry Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear and/or Clearstream.
Redemption of Global

<<<

 Notes
In the event any Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, or their respective nominees, as applicable, will distribute the amount received by them in respect of the Global Note so redeemed to the

<<<

 holders of the Book-Entry Interests from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The aggregate price payable to the holders of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear and

<<<

/or Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note, or any portion thereof. The Issuer understands that, under existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed

<<<

 at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective participants' accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate; provided, however

<<<

, that no Book-Entry Interest of 100,000 may be redeemed in part.
Payments on Global Notes
Payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, interest and additional amounts) will be made by the Issuer

<<<

 in euros to the paying agent. The paying agent will, in turn, make such payments to Euroclear and/or Clearstream after the common depositary advises the paying agent of the amounts due to each of Euroclear and/or Clearstream as of the relevant

<<<

 record date and instructs the paying agent to make the payments to Euroclear and/or Clearstream. Euroclear and/or Clearstream will in turn distribute such payments to participants in accordance with its procedures. We will make payments of

<<<

 all such amounts without deduction or withholding for or on account of any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature except as may be required by
275

law and as described under "D e sc rip tio

<<<

 n o f th e N o te s -- W ith h o ld in g Taxes. '' If any such deduction or withholding is required to be made, then, to the extent described under `D e s c r ip tio n o f th e N o te s -- W ith h o ld in g T axes,' we will pay additional amounts

<<<

 as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by any holder of the Global Notes or owner of Book-Entry Interests after such deduction or withholding will equal the net amounts that such holder or owner would have otherwise received

<<<

 in respect of such Global Note or Book-Entry Interest, as the case may be, absent such withholding or deduction.
We expect that payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through such participants will be governed by standing

<<<

 customer instructions and customary practices, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers registered in "street name.'' Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the

<<<

 responsibility of such participants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers registered in "street name.''
In order to tender Book-Entry Interests in a change of control offer or asset sale offer, the holder of

<<<

 the applicable Global Note must, within the time period specified in such offer, give notice of such tender to the paying agents and specify the principal amount of Book-Entry Interests to be tendered.
Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests

<<<


Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder (including the presentation of Notes for exchange as described above) only at the direction of the participant to whose account

<<<

 the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion to the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such participant has given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any

<<<

 discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an Event of Default under the Indenture, each of Euroclear and Clearstream reserves the right to exchange

<<<

 the Global Notes for Definitive Registered Notes in certificated form, and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to its participants, as described in the subsection "--D e fin itiv e R e g iste re d N o te s. ''
Global Clearance, Settlement

<<<

 and Trading under the Book-Entry System
Application will be made to list the Notes represented by the Global Notes on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and to admit the Notes to trading on the Global Exchange Market. Transfers of

<<<

 interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with the respective rules and operating procedures.
The following description of the operations and procedures

<<<

 of Euroclear and Clearstream is provided solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the relevant settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. None of us, the Trustee, or the

<<<

 paying agents takes any responsibility for these operations and procedures and urge investors to contact the systems or their participants directly to discuss these matters.
Initial Settlement
Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in

<<<

 euro. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional eurobonds in registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts

<<<

 of Euroclear or Clearstream holders on the business day following the settlement date against payment for value on the settlement date.
Secondary Market Trading
The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream

<<<

 and will settle in same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser's and seller's accounts are located to ensure that

<<<

 settlement can be made on the desired value date.
Special Timing Considerations
You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other communications involving Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream

<<<

 on days when those systems are open for business.

In addition, because of time-zone differences, there may be complications with completing transactions involving Euroclear and/or Clearstream on the same business day as in the United

<<<

 States. U.S. investors who wish to transfer their interests in the Notes, or to receive or make a payment or delivery of Notes, on a particular day, may find that the transactions will not be performed until the next business day in Brussels

<<<

 if Euroclear is used, or Luxembourg if Clearstream is used. Clearing Information We expect that the Notes will be accepted for clearance through the facilities of Euroclear and Clearstream. The international securities identification numbers

<<<

 and common code numbers for the Notes are set out under ``Listing and General Information Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations and facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between

<<<

 their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide to their participants, among other things, services for safekeeping, administration, clearance and settlement

<<<

 of internationally traded securities and securities lending and borrowing. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities

<<<

 brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear or Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodian

<<<

 relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability

<<<

 of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite

<<<

 certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In

<<<

 addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS
EU Savings

<<<

 Tax Directive
Under EU Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments (the "EU Savings Directive"), each Member State is required to provide to the tax authorities of another Member State details

<<<

 of payments of interest or other similar income paid by a person within its jurisdiction to, or collected by such a person for, an individual resident in that other Member State or certain limited types of entity (called "Residual Entities

<<<

'' within the meaning of article 4.2 of the EU Savings Directive) established in that other Member State. However, for a transitional period, Luxembourg and Austria may instead (unless during that period they elect otherwise) apply a withholding

<<<

 system in relation to such payments, deducting tax at a rate of 35 per cent. The transitional period is to terminate at the end of the first full fiscal year following agreement by certain non-EU countries to the exchange of information relating

<<<

 to such payments. On April 10, 2013, the Luxembourg government announced its intention to abolish the withholding tax procedure with effect as of January 1, 2015 in favor of the automatic exchange of information procedure as provided for by

<<<

 the EU Savings Directive.
On 18 March 2014, the Luxembourg government has submitted to the Luxembourg Parliament the draft Bill N 6668 on taxation of savings income putting an end to the current withholding tax regime as from 1 January 20

<<<

15 and implementing the automatic exchange of information as from that date. This draft Bill is in line with the announcement of the Luxembourg government of April 10, 2013. A number of non-EU countries, and certain dependent or associated territories

<<<

 of certain Member States, have adopted similar measures (either provision of information or transitional withholding) in relation to payments made by a person within its jurisdiction to, or collected by such a person for, an individual resident

<<<

 in a Member State or a Residual Entity established in a Member State. In addition, the Member States have entered into provision of information or transitional withholding arrangements with certain of those dependent or associated territories

<<<

 in relation to payments made by a person in a Member State to, or collected by such a person for, an individual resident in, or a Residual Entity established in, one of those dependent or associated territories.
The European Council formally

<<<

 adopted a Council Directive amending the EU Savings Directive on March 24, 2014 (the "Amending Directive''). The Amending Directive broadens the scope of the requirements described above. Member States have until January 1, 2016 to adopt the

<<<

 national legislation necessary to comply with the Amending Directive. The changes made under the Amending Directive include extending the scope of the EU Savings Directive to payments made to, or secured for, certain other entities and legal

<<<

 arrangements. They also broaden the definition of "interest payment'' to cover income that is equivalent to interest.
Investors who are in any doubt as to their position should consult their professional advisers.
The proposed Financial Transactions

<<<

 Tax (FTT)
The European Commission has published a proposal for a Directive for a common financial transactions tax ("FTT") in Austria, Belgium, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain (``Participating

<<<

 Member States").
The proposed FTT has a very broad scope and could, if introduced in its current form, apply to certain dealings in the Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances.
Pursuant to the current proposal

<<<

, the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and outside of the Participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in the Notes where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least

<<<

 one party is established in a Participating Member State. A financial institution may be, or be deemed to be, ``established'' in a Participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, including (i) by transacting with a person established

<<<

 in a Participating Member State or (ii) where the financial instrument which is subject to the dealings is issued in a Participating Member State.
The FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the Participating Member States and is

<<<

 the subject of legal challenge. It may therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. Additional Member States may decide to participate. Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own

<<<

 professional advice in relation to the FTT.

Certain Finnish Tax Considerations
The following is a general description of certain Finnish tax consequences of the acquisition, holding and disposal of the Notes. It does not purport to be

<<<

 an exhaustive analysis of all possible tax considerations or consequences relating to the Notes which may be relevant to a holder or a prospective holder of Notes, nor does it purport to deal with the tax consequences applicable to all categories

<<<

 of investors, some of whom may be subject to special rules. Holders or prospective holders of the Notes should consult with their own tax advisers with regard to the tax consequences of investing in the Notes in their particular circumstances

<<<

. The description only addresses Finnish domestic tax legislation as in force on the date of this offering memorandum. Local tax advisors should be consulted about taxes potentially applicable in any other country than Finland, as relevant in

<<<

 each individual case.
Residents of Finland
Taxable income is determined separately for the so-called sources of business income, personal income and agricultural income.
For a private person, resident in Finland for tax purposes and taxed in

<<<

 accordance with the Income Tax Act (1535/1992, as amended), interest and capital gains relating to the Notes are generally taxed at the current (2014) capital income tax rate of 30% up to 40,000 and 32% for any amounts exceeding 40,000. The

<<<

 Finnish government plans to tighten the taxation so that for taxable capital income amounts exceeding 30,000, the tax rate would be 33% as of 2015 (based on current information). Repayments of Note capital are treated as (partial) disposals

<<<

 of the Notes. Capital gains are tax-exempt if all taxable sales proceeds received during a tax year in aggregate do not exceed 1,000. Correspondingly, capital losses are not deductible if the related acquisition costs in a tax year in aggregate

<<<

 do not exceed 1,000. Capital gains or losses are calculated by deducting the aggregate of the acquisition cost and the expenses related to acquiring the gain or loss from the sales proceeds. Alternatively, instead of applying the actual acquisition

<<<

 cost, individuals and estates can apply a ``presumed acquisition cost," in which case no additional actual expenses can be deducted. The presumed acquisition cost is 20% (and if the Notes have been owned for a period of at least ten years,

<<<

 40%) of the sales price. Capital losses resulting from the disposal of such Notes, which do not belong to the business activities of individuals or estates, can generally be set off against capital gains from disposals of other non-business

<<<

 assets derived during the tax year of the disposal and five subsequent years.
For Finnish resident corporate entities, interest and capital gains relating to the Notes are generally taxed at a flat rate of 20% (current rate in 2014). Repayments

<<<

 of Note capital are treated as (partial) disposals of the Notes. The remaining acquisition cost in taxation of the Notes is regarded as tax-deductible expenditure upon disposal of the Notes. Losses resulting from the disposal of Notes, which

<<<

 belong to the business activities, can be set off against income from the same income source during the year of the disposal and ten subsequent tax years. Capital losses resulting from the disposal of Notes, which belong to the personal income

<<<

 source, can be set off against capital gains from disposals of other non-business assets derived during the tax year of the disposal and five subsequent years.
Nonresidents of Finland
Unless the capital gains or interest income received from

<<<

 the Notes relate to a permanent establishment from which business is carried on in Finland, a nonresident of Finland is not liable to pay Finnish income tax on the capital gains or interest received from the Notes. No withholding tax is due

<<<

 on interest payments based on the Notes to nonresidents of Finland.
Gift and inheritance tax
Unless an applicable international tax treaty states otherwise, gift or inheritance taxes will arise in Finland with respect to a transfer of the Notes

<<<

 by way of gift by, or on the death of, a holder of such Notes, in case the donor/deceased person or the donee/beneficiary was a resident of Finland at the time of the gift/death. Subject to certain restrictions, the Finnish inheritance and

<<<

 gift tax act allows crediting the gift or inheritance tax, paid for the same property in some other country in case the donee/beneficiary is a resident in Finland. For the purposes of Finnish gift and inheritance taxes, a person who has his

<<<

/her permanent home and dwelling in Finland, is deemed resident in Finland.
279

Transfer tax
No Finnish transfer tax will be payable on a transfer of Notes.

Holders not resident in Sweden
Payments of any principal amount or any amount that is considered to be interest for Swedish tax purposes to the holder of any Notes should not be subject to Swedish income

<<<

 tax, provided that such a holder is not resident in Sweden for Swedish tax purposes and provided that such a holder does not have a permanent establishment in Sweden to which the Notes are effectively connected.
Swedish withholding tax, or

<<<

 Swedish tax deduction, is not imposed on payments of any principal amount or any amount that is considered to be interest for Swedish tax purposes, except for certain payments of interest (and other returns on Notes) to a private individual

<<<

 (or an estate of a deceased individual) with residence in Sweden for Swedish tax purposes (see 'H o ld e r s re sid e n t in S w e d e n " below).
Holders resident in Sweden
Generally, for Swedish corporations and private individuals (and estates

<<<

 of deceased individuals) with residence in Sweden for Swedish tax purposes, all capital income (e.g., income that is considered to be interest for Swedish tax purposes and capital gains on Notes) will be taxable. Specific tax consequences,

<<<

 however, may be applicable to certain categories of corporations, e.g., life insurance companies. Further, specific tax consequences may be applicable if, and to the extent that, a holder of Notes realizes a capital loss on the Notes and to

<<<

 any currency exchange gains or losses.
If amounts that are considered to be interest for Swedish tax purposes are paid by a legal entity domiciled in Sweden, including a Swedish branch, to a private individual (or an estate of a deceased individual

<<<

) with residence in Sweden for Swedish tax purposes, Swedish preliminary taxes are normally withheld by the legal entity on such payments. Swedish preliminary taxes should normally also be withheld on other returns on Notes (but not capital

<<<

 gains), if the return is paid out together with such a payment of interest referred to above.
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations
TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH TREASURY DEPARTMENT CIRCULAR 230, HOLDERS ARE HEREBY NOTIFIED THAT: (A)

<<<

 ANY DISCUSSION OF U.S. FEDERAL TAX ISSUES IN THIS OFFERING MEMORANDUM IS NOT INTENDED OR WRITTEN TO BE RELIED UPON, AND CANNOT BE RELIED UPON, BY HOLDERS FOR THE PURPOSE OF AVOIDING PENALTIES THAT MAY BE IMPOSED ON HOLDERS UNDER THE U.S. INTERNAL

<<<

 REVENUE CODE; (B) SUCH DISCUSSION IS INCLUDED HEREIN BY THE ISSUER IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROMOTION OR MARKETING (WITHIN THE MEANING OF CIRCULAR 230) BY THE ISSUER OF THE TRANSACTIONS OR MATTERS ADDRESSED HEREIN; AND (C) HOLDERS SHOULD SEEK

<<<

 ADVICE BASED ON THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES FROM AN INDEPENDENT TAX ADVISOR.
The following is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of Notes by a U.S. Holder (as defined

<<<

 below). This summary is based on provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), Treasury regulations and rulings and decisions currently in effect, all of which are subject to change (possibly with retroactive effect

<<<

). We have not and will not seek a ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") regarding the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take positions concerning the tax
280

consequences of the purchase

<<<

, ownership or disposition of the Notes that are different from those discussed below or that a court will not agree with any such positions. This summary assumes that investors purchase either series of Notes at their ``issue price" (the first

<<<

 price at which a substantial amount of such series of Notes is sold for money, excluding sales to underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) in the initial offering and that they hold the Notes as capital assets within the meaning of Section

<<<

 1221 of the Code. The discussion does not cover all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to, or the actual tax effect that any of the matters described herein will have on, the acquisition, ownership or disposition of

<<<

 Notes by particular investors, and does not address U.S. federal non-income, state, local, foreign or other tax laws. This summary also does not discuss all of the tax considerations that may be relevant to certain types of investors subject

<<<

 to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws (such as financial institutions, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, S corporations, investors in partnerships or other pass-through entities for U.S. federal

<<<

 tax purposes, insurance companies, investors liable for the alternative minimum tax, individual retirement accounts and other tax-deferred accounts, tax-exempt organizations, dealers in securities or currencies, persons that use or are required

<<<

 to use the mark-to-market method of accounting for securities, investors that will hold the Notes as part of straddles, hedging, integrated, constructive sale, or conversion transactions for U.S. federal income tax purposes, U.S. individual

<<<

 expatriates or entities subject to the U.S. anti-inversion rules or investors whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar). Additionally, this summary does not describe any tax consequences arising from the Medicare tax on certain ``net

<<<

 investment income'' pursuant to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.
As used herein, the term ``U.S. Holder'' means a beneficial owner of Notes that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) an individual citizen or

<<<

 resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia

<<<

, (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax without regard to its source or (iv) a trust if it (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the U.S. and one or more U.S. persons have the authority

<<<

 to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.
The U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in an entity that is treated

<<<

 as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes that holds Notes will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Prospective purchasers that are partnerships should consult their tax advisors concerning

<<<

 the U.S. federal income tax consequences to their partners of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of Notes by the partnership.
THE SUMMARY OF U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES SET OUT BELOW IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY. ALL PROSPECTIVE

<<<

 PURCHASERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF OWNING THE NOTES, INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF U.S. FEDERAL NON-INCOME, STATE, LOCAL, NON-U.S. AND OTHER TAX LAWS AND POSSIBLE CHANGES

<<<

 IN TAX LAW.
Additional Payments
In certain circumstances (see ``D e s c r ip tio n o f th e N o te s -- O p tio n a l R e d e m p t i o n " ``D e s c r ip tio n o f th e N o te s -- C h a n g e o f C o n tr o l" and ``D e s c r ip tio n o f

<<<

 th e N o te s -- --W ith h o ld in g T a x e s ") we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of stated interest or principal on a series of Notes.
Because of the possibility of such payments, subject to certain exceptions, a series of Notes

<<<

 may be treated as ``contingent payment debt instruments,'' in which case the timing and amount of income inclusions and the character of income recognized may be different from the consequences discussed herein. Although the issue is not free

<<<

 from doubt, the Issuer intends to take the position that the possibility of such additional amounts being paid on a series of Notes is remote or incidental under applicable Treasury regulations. Therefore, the Issuer does not intend to treat

<<<

 the potential payment of additional interest or the potential payment of a premium pursuant to the optional redemption or change of control provisions as part of the yield to maturity of a series of Notes and does not intend to treat the Notes

<<<

 as contingent payment debt instruments.
The Issuer's determination that these contingencies are remote or incidental is binding on a U.S. Holder, unless such U.S. Holder explicitly discloses to the IRS on its tax return for the year during

<<<

 which it acquires a series of Notes that it is taking a different position. However, this determination is not binding on the
281

IRS. If the IRS takes a contrary position to that described above, a U.S. Holder may be required to accrue interest

<<<

 income on a series of Notes based upon a comparable yield, regardless of the U.S. Holder's method of accounting. The "comparable yield'' of the relevant series of Notes is the yield at which the Issuer would issue a fixed-rate debt instrument

<<<

 with no contingent payments, but with terms and conditions similar to those of such series of Notes. In addition, any gain on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of such series of Notes would generally be recharacterized

<<<

 as ordinary income. U.S. Holders of Notes should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of a series of Notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the Notes will

<<<

 not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments.
Payments of Stated Interest
Stated interest on a Note will be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary income at the time it is received or accrued, depending on the holder's method of accounting

<<<

 for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Stated interest paid by the Issuer on the Notes generally constitutes income from sources outside the United States. The amount of stated income recognized by a cash basis U.S. Holder will be the U.S. dollar

<<<

 value of the interest payment (including a payment attributable to accrued but unpaid interest upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note), based on the exchange rate between the euro and the U.S. dollar in effect

<<<

 on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. A cash basis U.S. Holder generally will not realize exchange gain or loss on the interest payment but may realize exchange gain or loss when the

<<<

 holder disposes of any foreign currency it receives (as discussed below under "E x c h a n g e G a in o r L o s s w ith R e s p e c t to F oreign C u rre n c y ").
An accrual basis U.S. Holder may determine the amount of income recognized with

<<<

 respect to an interest payment denominated in foreign currency in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, the amount of income accrued will be based on the average exchange rate in effect during the interest accrual period

<<<

 (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years of the U.S. Holder, the part of the period within the taxable year).
Under the second method, an accrual basis U.S. Holder may elect to determine the amount of income accrued

<<<

 on the basis of the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years of the U.S. Holder, the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the part of the period within

<<<

 the taxable year). Additionally, if a payment of interest is actually received within five business days of the last day of the accrual period, an electing accrual basis U.S. Holder may instead translate the accrued interest into U.S. dollars

<<<

 at the exchange rate in effect on the day of actual receipt. Any such election will apply to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies or thereafter acquired by the

<<<

 U.S. Holder and will be irrevocable without the consent of the IRS.
Upon an accrual basis U.S. Holder's receipt of an interest payment (including a payment attributable to accrued but unpaid interest upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other

<<<

 taxable disposition of a Note) denominated in foreign currency, the U.S. Holder may recognize exchange gain or loss (taxable as ordinary income or loss and generally U.S. source) equal to the difference between the amount received (translated

<<<

 into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the date of receipt) and the amount previously accrued, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars.
In the event that Additional Amounts are paid in respect of withholding

<<<

 or deductions for taxes imposed on payments on the Notes (as described under `D e s c r ip tio n o f th e N o te s -- W ith h o ld in g T axes"), such Additional Amounts will be taxable to U.S. Holders as ordinary income at the time the amounts

<<<

 accrue or are received, in accordance with such holder's regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The amount taxable to such U.S. Holder will also include all taxes withheld or deducted in respect thereof. As a result

<<<

, U.S. Holders may be required to report income in an amount greater than the cash they receive in respect of payments on the Notes.
A U.S. Holder may be entitled to deduct or credit foreign taxes imposed on interest income (including Additional

<<<

 Amounts, if any), subject to certain limitations (including that the election to deduct or credit foreign taxes applies to all of the U.S. Holder's other applicable foreign taxes for a particular tax year). Interest income (including any Additional

<<<

 Amounts) on a Note generally will be considered foreign source income and, for purposes of the U.S. foreign tax credit, generally will be considered passive category income. A U.S. Holder will generally be denied a foreign tax credit for foreign

<<<

 taxes imposed with respect to the Notes where such U.S. Holder does not meet a minimum holding period requirement during which it is not protected from risk of loss. The rules governing the foreign tax credit are complex and this
282

paragraph

<<<

 discusses those rules only at a high level of generality. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of the foreign tax credit under their particular circumstances.
Sale, Exchange, Retirement or Other Taxable

<<<

 Disposition of the Notes
A U.S. Holder will generally recognize gain or loss on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale, exchange, retirement or other

<<<

 taxable disposition (not including any amounts that are attributable to accrued but unpaid interest, which will be taxable as described above under "Payments of Stated Interest") and the U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in the Note. A U.S.

<<<

 Holder's adjusted tax basis in a Note will generally be its U.S. dollar cost (as defined below) reduced by the amount of any principal paid on the Note. The U.S. dollar cost of a Note purchased with foreign currency will be the U.S. dollar

<<<

 value of the foreign currency paid for the Note determined at the spot rate on the Issue Date. The amount realized on a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition for an amount in foreign currency will be the U.S. dollar value

<<<

 of this amount based on the spot rate on the date of the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition (or, in the case of a cash basis or electing accrual method taxpayer, the settlement date of the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition

<<<

, if the relevant series of Notes is traded on an established securities market for U.S. federal income tax purposes). The election referred to in this paragraph must be applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot

<<<

 be changed without the consent of the IRS.
Except as described in the next paragraph, gain or loss on a disposition of a Note generally will be U.S. source capital gain or loss. Any capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss

<<<

 if the U.S. Holder has held the Note for more than one year at the time of disposition. A non-corporate U.S. Holder generally will be eligible for reduced rates of taxation on any long-term capital gain recognized. Deductions for capital losses

<<<

 are subject to limitations.
A portion of a U.S. Holder's gain or loss with respect to the principal amount of a Note may be treated as exchange gain or loss. Such exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss and generally

<<<

 will be U.S. source income or loss. For these purposes, the principal amount of the Note is the U.S. Holder's purchase price for the Note calculated in foreign currency on the date of purchase, and the amount of exchange gain or loss is equal

<<<

 to the difference between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined at the spot rate on the date of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Note (or, in the case of a cash basis or electing accrual

<<<

 basis taxpayer, the settlement date of such taxable disposition, if the Note is treated as traded on an established securities market for U.S. federal income tax purposes) and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined at

<<<

 the spot rate on the date the U.S. Holder purchased the Note. Any such exchange rate gain or loss (including any exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of accrued but unpaid interest) will be realized only to the extent of total

<<<

 gain or loss realized on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition.
Exchange Gain or Loss with Respect to Foreign Currency
The tax basis of a U.S. Holder in foreign currency received as interest on a Note will be the U.S.

<<<

 dollar value thereof at the spot rate in effect on the date the foreign currency is received. Upon the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of a Note, if the relevant series of Notes is traded on an established securities market for

<<<

 U.S. federal income tax purposes, a cash basis taxpayer or an electing accrual basis taxpayer will have a basis in the foreign currency received equal to the U.S. dollar value thereof at the spot rate in effect on the settlement date of such

<<<

 sale, exchange or disposition (that is, the same date that the foreign currency is valued for purposes of determining the amount realized on the Note). In all other cases, since the amount realized is based on the spot rate in effect on the

<<<

 date of the sale, exchange or retirement of the Note (including the trade date if the relevant series of Notes is traded on an established securities market), (i) the taxpayer will realize foreign exchange gain or loss to the extent the U.S

<<<

. dollar value of the foreign currency received (based on the spot rate in effect on the date of receipt) differs from the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency on the date of the sale, exchange, or retirement of the Note, and (ii) the taxpayer

<<<

's basis in the foreign currency received will equal the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency, based on the spot rate in effect on the date of receipt. Any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on a sale, exchange or other disposition

<<<

 of the foreign currency will be ordinary income or loss and generally will be U.S. source income or loss.
In certain circumstances, U.S. Treasury regulations require foreign exchange losses in excess of a threshold amount to be reported to

<<<

 the IRS. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors to determine the tax
283

return obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the Notes, including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886. Backup Withholding and Information Reporting

<<<

 In general, payments of principal, interest on, and the proceeds of a sale or other disposition of Notes, by a U.S. paying agent or other U.S. intermediary will be reported to the IRS and to the U.S. Holder as may be required under applicable

<<<

 information reporting requirements. Backup withholding may apply to these payments if the U.S. Holder fails to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number or certification of exempt status or otherwise fails to comply with the applicable

<<<

 backup withholding rules. Certain U.S. Holders that provide an appropriate certification or otherwise qualify for exemption are not subject to backup withholding. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors as to their qualification for

<<<

 exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining an exemption. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules from a payment made to a U.S. Holder generally may be claimed

<<<

 as a credit against such holder's U.S. federal income tax liability provided the appropriate information is timely furnished to the IRS. Information with Respect to Foreign Financial Assets Individual U.S. Holders that own "specified foreign

<<<

 financial assets'' with an aggregate value in excess of $50,000 are generally required to file information reports with respect to such assets with their U.S. federal income tax returns. Depending on the individual's circumstances, higher threshold

<<<

 amounts may apply. ``Specified foreign financial assets'' include any financial accounts maintained by foreign financial institutions, as well as any of the following, but only if they are not held in accounts maintained by certain financial

<<<

 institutions: (i) stocks and securities issued by non-U.S. persons, (ii) financial instruments and contracts held for investment that have non-U.S. issuers or counterparties and (iii) interests in non-U.S. entities. A series of Notes may be

<<<

 treated as specified foreign financial assets. A U.S. Holder may be subject to this information reporting regime and required to file IRS Form 8938 listing these assets with its U.S. federal income tax return. Failure to file information reports

<<<

 may subject a U.S. Holder to penalties. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding their obligations to file information reports with respect to the Notes.

 State in which an entity's ``centre of main interests" (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) is situated has jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings. The determination of where the debtor concerned

<<<

 has its ``centre of main interests" is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. It should also be noted that ``centre of main interests" is not a static concept and

<<<

 may change from time to time. Although under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation there is a rebuttable presumption that the debtor concerned would have its ``centre of main interests" in the Member State in which it has its registered

<<<

 office, Preamble 13 of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the ``centre of main interests" of a debtor should correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and ``is therefore ascertainable

<<<

 by third parties." In this respect, factors such as the place in which the debtor concerned holds board meetings, the place where the debtor concerned conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the place where the large

<<<

 majority of the debtor concerned's creditors are established may all be relevant in the determination of the place where the debtor concerned has its ``centre of main interests.''
For the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction

<<<

 to open insolvency proceedings, a debtor's ``centre of main interests'' will be determined at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition.
The EU Insolvency Regulation applies to insolvency proceedings that are collective insolvency proceedings

<<<

 of the types referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Save as otherwise provided in the EU Insolvency Regulation, the law applicable to insolvency proceedings and their effects shall be that of the Member State within the territory

<<<

 of which such proceedings are opened. The law of the Member State (other than Denmark) of the opening of proceedings shall determine the conditions for the opening of those proceedings, their conduct and their closure. Any judgment opening

<<<

 insolvency proceedings handed down by a court of a Member State (other than Denmark) which has jurisdiction in accordance with Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation shall be recognized in all the other Member States from the time that

<<<

 it becomes effective in the Member State of the opening of the proceedings.
If the ``centre of main interests'' of entity debtor is in one Member State (other than Denmark) under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another

<<<

 Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open territorial insolvency proceedings against that debtor only if such debtor has an ``establishment'' in the territory of such other Member State. An ``establishment'' is defined to

<<<

 mean a place of operations at which the debtor carries on non-transitory economic activity with human means and goods. The effects of those insolvency proceedings opened in that other Member State are restricted to the assets of the company

<<<

 situated in such other Member State.
Where main proceedings have been opened in the Member State in which the debtor has its ``centre of main interests,'' any proceedings opened subsequently in another Member State in which the debtor has an

<<<

 establishment (secondary proceedings) are limited to ``winding-up proceedings" listed in Annex B of the EU Insolvency Regulation. Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the debtor has its ``centre of main interests'' have not yet

<<<

 been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings can only be opened in another Member State in which the debtor has an establishment where either (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the Member State in which the debtor's ``centre

<<<

 of main interests'' is situated under that Member State's law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of a creditor that is domiciled, habitually resident or has its registered office in the other Member State

<<<

 or whose claim arises from the operation of the establishment.
The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court opening main proceedings which will be given the same effect in the other Member States

<<<

 so long as no territorial proceedings have been opened there. The liquidator appointed by a court in a Member State that has jurisdiction to open main proceedings (because the debtor's ``centre of main interests'' is there) may exercise the

<<<

 powers conferred on him or her by the law of that Member State in another Member State
285

(such as to remove assets of the company from that other Member State) subject to certain limitations so long as no insolvency proceedings have been

<<<

 opened in that other Member State or any preservation measures taken to the contrary further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in that other Member State in which the debtor has assets.
Further to the above, the Nordic Bankruptcy

<<<

 Convention of 7 November 1933 (the ``N o rd ic B a n k ru p tc y C o n v e n tio n "), which has been signed by Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden (each a "N o rd ic C o u n try '' and together, the "N o r d ic C o u n trie s"), applies

<<<

 between these Nordic countries. However, the EU Insolvency Regulation has replaced the convention as between Finland and Sweden. According to the Nordic Bankruptcy Convention a bankruptcy opened in any of the Nordic Countries comprises all

<<<

 assets and liabilities of a bankrupt debtor located in any of these countries, and the bankruptcy administrator is authorized to dispose of all the assets of the bankruptcy estate, regardless of such location (save for the EU Insolvency Regulation

<<<

 which apply between Sweden and Finland). Moreover, the Nordic Bankruptcy Convention stipulates that the law of the Nordic country in which the insolvency proceedings are opened (lex concursus) is applicable unless any specific exception is

<<<

 stated in the Nordic Bankruptcy Convention.
Finland
Applicable Insolvency Law
The Issuer, certain of the Guarantors and Safari Finco 1 Oy (a non-Guarantor security provider), are incorporated and have their centre of main interests in Finland

<<<

. In the event of insolvency of the Issuer or the Guarantor, insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Finland. Such proceedings would be governed by Finnish law.
Under Finnish law, if a company is insolvent or is at risk of becoming insolvent

<<<

, the company may be the subject of three alternative types of proceedings: company restructuring, bankruptcy and liquidation. However, in practice, a liquidation proceeding would be followed by bankruptcy of the company if the settlement of

<<<

 all of the company's debts is not possible.
There are two primary insolvency regimes under Finnish law. The first, company restructuring (yrity ssa n e e ra u s), is intended to investigate whether the business has a reasonable possibility

<<<

 and sufficient resources to continue and, if so, to rehabilitate the company's viable business, ensure its continued viability and make arrangements with creditors. The second, bankruptcy (k o n k u rssi), is primarily designed to liquidate

<<<

 and distribute the assets of a debtor to its creditors.
Company Restructuring
If a company is insolvent or is at risk of becoming insolvent, and it is probable that company restructuring proceedings would remedy the insolvency or prevent its

<<<

 recurrence otherwise than temporarily, an application for company restructuring can be submitted to a court by the debtor or by one or more creditors in accordance with the Finnish Restructuring of Enterprises Act (47/1993, L a k i yrityk sen

<<<

 s a n e e r a u k se sta ). Further, the initiation of company restructuring proceedings is possible--in theory, irrespective of the company's solvency situation--when at least two creditors whose total claims represent at least one-fifth of

<<<

 the debtor's known debts and who are not related to the debtor file a joint application with the debtor or declare that they support the debtor's application for company restructuring. If there are no legal barriers to company restructuring

<<<

 and, consequently, the court approves the application and opens company reorganization proceedings, the court will simultaneously appoint an administrator (se lv ittd jd ). The board of directors and the managing director continue to act on

<<<

 behalf of the company during the restructuring proceedings. The restructuring administrator is entitled to review the company's books and business documents, obtain any information on the company's business activities, as well as to participate

<<<

 in meetings of the debtor's corporate bodies.
As a general rule, the commencement of restructuring proceedings has no effect on the debtor's existing contracts. However, there are some exceptions set forth in the Finnish Restructuring of Enterprises

<<<

 Act regarding premature termination of certain contracts, such as lease agreements, unfulfilled contracts not deemed to be a regular part of the activities of the debtor and employment relationships.
If requested by the applicant or the debtor

<<<

 and approved by the court, all existing claims against the company are suspended as of the commencement of the company restructuring, or, in respect of the actions other than the seizure of assets referred to below, after the application for

<<<

 company restructuring has become pending. The suspension as a main rule prohibits the enforcement and granting of security, the repayment and enforcement of debts that have fallen due before the commencement of the restructuring
286

program

<<<

 (although debts arising after the filing of the company restructuring application can be repaid and enforced) and the seizure of assets. The suspensions are in force until the company restructuring program has been confirmed by the district

<<<

 court or the proceedings have been dismissed due to lack of funds of the company under the restructuring program or due to a violation of the program by the debtor.
Debts arising after the filing of the application of the restructuring proceedings

<<<

 must be repaid as they become due. The same applies to fees, charges and other running expenses (e.g., lease payments) based on a continuous contractual relationship or on a continuous contract on use or possession, to the extent as these relate

<<<

 to the period subsequent to the filing of the application.
Creditors with equal ranking have an equal status in the arrangements of the restructuring of debts within the company restructuring program. Subject to certain restrictions set forth

<<<

 in the Finnish Restructuring of Enterprises Act, the following measures may be taken with respect to unsecured debts in the company restructuring program: (i) changing the repayment schedule; (ii) ordering that debt payments be considered as

<<<

 payments against principal first, and as payments of interest and other credit costs only second; (iii) reducing the obligation to pay interest and other credit costs with respect to the remaining term of a debt (or remove these obligations

<<<

 entirely); and (iv) reducing the outstanding principal balance of unpaid debt. The company restructuring program may also include the full or partial refinancing of debt. Consequently, the company restructuring proceedings could result in holders

<<<

 of the Notes receiving a right to recover considerably less than they would otherwise be entitled to recover under the Note Guarantees.
Secured debt in restructuring proceedings means restructuring debt where the creditor holds an effective

<<<

 (against third parties) security interest over property that belongs to or is in the possession of the debtor, but only insofar as the value of the security at the commencement of the restructuring proceedings would have been enough to cover

<<<

 the amount of the creditor's claim after the deduction of liquidation costs and claims with a higher priority. If the value of the security is less than the amount of the creditor's claim, the remaining unsecured part of the debt is considered

<<<

 ordinary unsecured debt. Secured debts include security interests over specific assets as well as business mortgages. Regarding business mortgages, only 50% of the value of the mortgaged property will be considered as secured debt. The value

<<<

 of the property will be determined in the restructuring program.
The following debt arrangements may be applied to secured debt: (i) changing the repayment schedule; (ii) ordering that debt payments be applied as payments against principal

<<<

 first and as payments of interest and other credit costs second; and (iii) reducing the obligation to pay interest and other credit costs with respect to the remaining term of the debt. Even if the debt arrangement does not affect the existence

<<<

 or content of a creditor's security interest, the security arrangements relating to the debt may be altered by replacing the security with other fully adequate security.
Payments of secured debt shall be structured so that at least the present

<<<

 value of the secured debt will be repaid within a reasonable period, not to materially exceed the remainder of the credit period without the consent of the creditor or, if the debt has become due in full, one-half of the original credit period

<<<

. As for reducing interest and other credit costs, a court will take into consideration the length of the remaining credit period. The longer the remaining credit period, the smaller the reduction in interest and credit costs.
The restructuring

<<<

 program proposal will be drawn up by the restructuring administrator, and the court will ratify it subject to the approval of all the creditors, or with the acceptance of a majority within the groups of creditors. However, there are some specific

<<<

 limitations under the Finnish Restructuring of Enterprises Act which apply although the restructuring program is approved by all creditors or by a majority within all groups of creditors. Furthermore, even if the majority would not exist in

<<<

 one or several groups of creditors, the restructuring program may nonetheless be approved at the request of the person who has prepared the proposal, the administrator or the debtor, subject to the terms specified in the Finnish Restructuring

<<<

 of Enterprises Act. The debtor may also submit a proposal to the court with respect to the restructuring program, which the court may consider in its discretion.
Bankruptcy
A debtor or a qualifying creditor may apply for bankruptcy from a court

<<<

 of competent jurisdiction when the debtor is unable to pay its debts and the inability to pay is not temporary. If the application is approved, an estate administrator (or several estate administrators) (pesanhoitaja) will be appointed by the

<<<

 court.
287

A bankruptcy covers all the liabilities of the debtor, and its objective is to liquidate the assets of the debtor and use the proceeds received in payment of the creditors' claims. The bankruptcy estate may (in exceptional situations

<<<

) continue the company's business operations and the disposal of property should be realized as soon as it is reasonably possible. The debtor's assets are, from the beginning of the bankruptcy, subject to the authority of the estate administrator

<<<

. The creditors are represented through the meeting of creditors. The estate administrator must act for the common benefit of all creditors and shall comply with the decisions and guidelines of the creditors in matters falling within the decision

<<<

-making powers of the creditors.
As a main rule, in order to be entitled to a disbursement, a creditor must file a claim in bankruptcy in writing (a ``lodgment of claim'') with the estate administrator, by a deadline set by the estate administrator

<<<

. Information concerning the deadline is sent to all known creditors and published in local newspaper as well as in the official gazette of Finland (V irallin en le h ti). The obligation to notify the bankruptcy estate of a claim is binding

<<<

 even on a creditor with a secured claim. A creditor who holds assets belonging to the debtor as security for the debt of a third party must, at the request of, and within a time limit set by, the estate administrator, provide the same information

<<<

 on the receivables and collateral as should be provided in a claim letter. A creditor who holds a business mortgage over the assets of the debtor as security for a claim shall file the claim as provided in the Finnish Bankruptcy Act. If a claim

<<<

 is denominated in a currency other than euro, the value in euro for the purposes of the bankruptcy proceedings is determined using the exchange rate of the date of commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings.
A creditor who wishes to use his

<<<

 or her claim for set-off against a debt owed to the debtor must, when giving notice of the set-off, provide the estate administrator with the same information that would be provided in a claim letter.
The estate administrator draws up a list

<<<

 of how the proceeds of the estate are to be divided among the creditors (``draft disbursement list''). The court verifies that the estate administrator's disbursement list meets the statutory requirements and that the procedural provisions

<<<

 relating to the draft disbursement list have been observed.
The entitlement of creditors to payment out of the proceeds of the bankruptcy estate is proportionate to the amount of their claims, unless otherwise provided by law. However, according

<<<

 to the Finnish Act on Order of Payment of the Creditors (1572/1992, L a k i v e lk o jie n m a k s u sa a n tija r je sty k se sta ), the following creditors have priority over unsecured creditors: (i) secured creditors and holders of retention

<<<

 rights have priority to payment out of the proceeds of the relevant asset; (ii) the administrative expenses of the bankruptcy estate, claims on the basis of contracts that the bankruptcy estate (rather than the debtor) has entered into, any

<<<

 liabilities for which the bankruptcy estate is responsible by operation of law and a debt that has arisen between the commencement and discontinuation of restructuring proceedings; and (iii) claims that are secured by a business mortgage will

<<<

 receive prior to other unsecured claims 50% of the value of the mortgaged assets. The rights of all of the above-mentioned preferred creditors may adversely affect the interests of holders of the Notes. Bankruptcy of a Finnish Guarantor could

<<<

 result in holders of the Notes recovering considerably less than they would have otherwise been entitled to recover.
Under Finnish law, certain claims are settled after all other claims. In practice, the most significant such claims are the

<<<

 interest accruing on the claim during the period subsequent to the commencement of the bankruptcy and a loan or a bond which pursuant to its terms is subordinated to ordinary debt. The Finnish state has no preferential rights regarding taxes

<<<

 and other fiscal charges. The assets of the bankruptcy estate are disposed of in the most advantageous manner so as to maximize the aggregate net proceeds. However, secured creditors that are secured pursuant to a fixed charge over movable

<<<

 or immovable property may exercise their right to enforce such collateral regardless of the bankruptcy proceedings. The bankruptcy estate may however prohibit the sale for a maximum of two months.
Recovery of Assets
Pursuant to the Recovery

<<<

 Act 758/1991, la k i ta k a sin sa a n n ista k o n k u rs sip e s d d n , certain acts carried out by a debtor can be revoked if the rights of creditors have been prejudiced by those acts. According to the Finnish Restructuring Act and the

<<<

 Finnish Enforcement Code (705/2007, U lo so tto k a a ri), the grounds for recovery set forth in the Recovery Act are also to be applied in company reorganization and enforcement proceedings.
The bankruptcy estate administrator, the administrator

<<<

 in the company restructuring and certain creditors may seek to recover assets of the debtor in connection with bankruptcy, company restructuring or
288

enforcement proceedings. The administrator or the creditors may, within a specified time

<<<

, either file an action for recovery against the debtor's counterparty in a separate court proceeding or file an objection. In bankruptcy, this period to file an action is one year from the commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings or three

<<<

 months from the moment that the bankruptcy estate has discovered or should have discovered grounds for recovery. In the case of a company restructuring program, the administrator must file an action within six months from the commencement of

<<<

 the restructuring proceedings or within three months from the moment that the administrator has discovered or should have discovered grounds for recovery.
Certain general rules for recovery apply to all transactions between an insolvent debtor

<<<

 (including a debtor who becomes insolvent partially due to the transaction) and the counterparty of the debtor. A transaction concluded within five years prior to the date when the petition for bankruptcy, company restructuring or enforcement

<<<

 is filed with the court or relevant authority (as well as transactions performed after such date) may be recovered if: (i) the transaction, either by itself or together with other transactions, improperly (a) favors a creditor at the expense

<<<

 of other creditors, (b) places property beyond the reach of creditors, or (c) increases debts to the detriment of the creditors; (ii) the debtor, at the time of the transaction, was, or partly due to the transaction became, insolvent or, in

<<<

 case of a transaction considered to be a gift or a contract with the characteristics of a gift, over-indebted; (iii) the counterparty knew or should have known of the insolvency or over-indebtedness, or the relevance of the transaction to the

<<<

 debtor's economic situation; and (iv) the counterparty knew or should have known the facts mentioned above in clause (i), on the basis of which the transaction is considered improper. The grounds for recovery under Section 5 of the Recovery

<<<

 Act, which covers all transactions concluded between the debtor and a counterparty, are thus applicable only if the counterparty had qualified or should have had qualified knowledge of all the issues described above in (i) and (ii). Transactions

<<<

 between the debtor and certain (natural or legal) persons within the debtor's sphere of interest (as defined in the Recovery Act) may be recovered regardless of the date of the transaction.
Pursuant to the Recovery Act, certain transactions

<<<

 can, in certain circumstances, be recovered regardless of the good faith of the counterparty and regardless of the solvency of the debtor at the time of the transaction. Such transactions include, among other things: (i) payments received through

<<<

 enforcement; (ii) the payment of debts; and (iii) the granting of security. Any debt paid later than three months prior to the date when the petition for bankruptcy, company restructuring or enforcement is filed with the court or relevant authority

<<<

 (or, in the event that the beneficiary is a person within the debtor's sphere of interest, within two years) may be recovered if: (i) unusual means of payment have been used; (ii) the payment was premature; or (iii) the amount of payment was

<<<

 considerable in comparison to the assets of the debtor. However, a payment may not be recovered if it, when all circumstances are taken into consideration, may be held as customary. Security given later than three months prior to the date when

<<<

 the petition for bankruptcy, company restructuring or enforcement is filed with the court or the relevant authority (or, in the event that the beneficiary is a person within the debtor's sphere of interest, within two years) may be recovered

<<<

 if: (i) the parties had not agreed upon the security in connection with the granting of the credit; or (ii) the possession of the security had not been transferred, or any similar act perfecting the security had not been taken without unjustified

<<<

 delay after the granting of the credit.
When a transaction is recovered, the property that has been received from the debtor is returned to the debtor bankruptcy estate if the debtor is in bankruptcy. The bankruptcy estate or the debtor also

<<<

 returns the compensation that had been paid for the property. If the compensation has been placed beyond the reach of the creditors and the party that paid the compensation knew or should have known that this was the intention of the debtor

<<<

, there is no obligation to return the compensation. If the property to be returned no longer exists, or is otherwise not returnable, compensation for the value of the property must be made. In addition, should the return of certain property

<<<

 cause inconvenience to the party under such obligation, a court may entitle such party to pay compensation equal to the value of the property instead of returning the property. The Recovery Act also sets forth an obligation to compensate for

<<<

 any decrease in value of the returnable property.
Accordingly, the validity of the Note Guarantees or any payment made thereunder may in the situations described above be challenged and it is possible that such challenge would be successful

<<<

. If the granting of a Note Guarantee or a payment made thereunder is successfully challenged, then the granting of such Note Guarantee could be nullified or the payment recovered. If such a challenge is successful, holders of the Notes may

<<<

 lose the benefit of the relevant Note Guarantee and the value of any consideration that the holders of the Notes had already received under that Note Guarantee could be recovered from the holders of the Notes.
289

Limitations
Pursuant to

<<<

 the provisions of the Finnish Companies Act (624/2006, as amended, the "Finnish Companies Act") a Finnish company may not provide financing, or grant guarantees or security to secure the financing, of the acquisition of its or its parent company

<<<

's shares (financial assistance). Generally, such provisions do not address any subsequent refinancing of acquisition debt. However, based on some views in the legal literature, in certain situations such subsequent refinancing, or the granting

<<<

 of guarantees or security to secure such subsequent refinancing, could be held to violate the applicable provisions on financial assistance.
Further, a company can only distribute its assets in the ways specified in the Finnish Companies Act

<<<

. Other transactions that reduce the assets of the company or increase its liabilities without a sound business reason constitute unlawful distribution of assets. Granting of guarantees and security is subject to the rules applicable to distribution

<<<

 of funds and therefore, requires that the granting of guarantee/security is based on sound business reasons (corporate benefit). The business justification for granting the guarantee/ security is assessed on a company-level and on a stand-alone

<<<

 basis, without regard to any group benefit (synergies and the like can be taken into account to the extent they create direct benefits, such as cost savings, to the company).
For the above-mentioned reasons, it is standard market practice for

<<<

 indentures, credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to include language pursuant to which the scope of guarantees and security granted by limited liability companies incorporated in Finland is contractually limited so as to not

<<<

 be in conflict with the relevant statutory limitations. In line with this practice, the Indenture and the relevant Security Documents and the Guarantees relating to security granted by Finnish Guarantors and Safari Finco 1 Oy, as a non-Guarantor

<<<

 security provider will contain such limitation language and thus be so limited.
The limitation language included in the Indenture will provide substantially as follows:
The guarantees provided by the Finnish Guarantors in respect of obligations

<<<

 owed by parties other a) than itself and its wholly-owned subsidiaries shall be limited if (and only if) and to the extent granting such guarantee would:
(i) constitute unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of Chapter 13 Section

<<<

 10 of the Finnish Companies Act, as amended or re-enacted from time to time; or
(ii) constitute unlawful distribution of assets within the meaning of Chapter 13 Section 1 of the Finnish Companies Act.
The terms of the security documents granted

<<<

 by each Finnish Guarantor other than the Issuer will limit enforcement in all material respects in the same manner and to the same extent as the above-mentioned limitations in respect of the payment obligations under the Finnish Guarantors

<<<

' Notes Guarantees. The New Revolving Credit Facility will contain a substantially similar limitation (except in relation guarantees and security provided by the relevant borrower and its parent entities), but due to the different uses of the

<<<

 proceeds of the financings, the actual application of the limitation may lead to a different outcome in relation to the New Revolving Credit Facility than in relation to the Notes.
In addition to the corporate benefit requirement, the granting

<<<

 of the guarantee/security has to be within the limits of the company's business purpose (as set out in its articles of association).
Security granted in favor of secured parties represented by a security agent
It is generally possible under

<<<

 Finnish law to grant security interests in favor of secured parties represented by an agent acting on their behalf and for this agent to act on behalf of the secured parties after the grant of security interest, e.g. in an enforcement scenario

<<<

. However, it remains unconfirmed under Finnish law whether the appointment of this agent can be validly made irrevocable or whether the secured parties nevertheless remain entitled under Finnish law to terminate (jointly or severally) the power

<<<

 of attorney or mandate of agency granted to the security agent or whether such power of attorney or mandate of agency would terminate by law in certain circumstances.
Creation of a valid security interest
Other than in respect of the creation

<<<

 of a floating security over qualifying movable business assets in the form of a separately registered enterprise mortgage and the creation of registered mortgages over assets
290

belonging to certain specific asset classes (such as real estate

<<<

 qualifying vehicles and intellectual property rights) capable of being the subject of registered security, the creation of a valid and enforceable security interest under Finnish law is achieved by pledging the security assets and perfecting

<<<

 such pledge, typically by transferring such security assets into the exclusive physical possession of the pledgee. In order for the perfection to be effective, the pledgor must be effectively deprived of its right to control, deal with or dispose

<<<

 of the security assets. If the pledgor remains in possession of, retains exclusive or shared control over, or remains entitled to operate or collect, invest and dispose of any income from such assets, the relevant security interest will not

<<<

 be deemed to have been effectively created until it is duly perfected, typically after the occurrence of the agreed trigger event. Perfection cannot be achieved once insolvency proceedings have been commenced and can be deemed susceptible and

<<<

 be set aside in insolvency proceedings if perfected within a certain critical time before the commencement of insolvency proceedings.
Stamp duty
No Finnish transfer tax, stamp duty or similar will be payable on granting of the Note Guarantees

<<<

 by the Finnish Guarantors or on provision of guarantee by the Issuer.
Sweden
Applicable Insolvency Law
As follows from the section ``European Union Insolvency Law'' above, a Swedish entity will in principle be subject to insolvency proceedings

<<<

 covered by the EU Insolvency Regulation if it has its centre of main interest in Sweden. Certain of the Guarantors and security providers are incorporated under the laws of Sweden and as such any insolvency proceedings applicable to any such

<<<

 Guarantor including any and all of its assets (in Sweden and abroad) will, as a starting point and by virtue of Article 4 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, be governed by Swedish insolvency law (lex f o r i c o n c u rsu s).
Insolvency Proceedings

<<<


In the event of a bankruptcy of a Swedish company the court will appoint a receiver in bankruptcy (k o n k u rsf rv a lta re ) who will work in the interest of all creditors with the objective of selling the debtor's assets and distribute

<<<

 the proceeds among the creditors.
The purpose of bankruptcy proceedings is to wind up the company in such a way that the company's creditors receive as high a proportion of their claims as possible. The receiver in bankruptcy is required to

<<<

 safeguard the assets and can decide to continue the business or to close it down, depending on what is best for all creditors. In general, the receiver in bankruptcy is required to sell the assets of the debtor as soon as possible and to distribute

<<<

 the proceeds in accordance with the mandatory priority rules as primarily set out in the Swedish Rights of Priority Act, as amended (F  rm  n sr ttsla g en (1970:979)) (the ``Rights of Priority Act''). In the interim, the receiver in bankruptcy

<<<

 will take over the management and control of the company and the company's directors and/or managing director will no longer be entitled to represent the company or dispose of the company's assets.
A declaration of bankruptcy does not automatically

<<<

 terminate existing contracts; instead, the receiver in bankruptcy may in its discretion choose to have the bankruptcy estate itself step into any such existing contracts. A clause in a contract which provides that the contract is terminated

<<<

 by reason of bankruptcy proceedings or similar is likely to be unenforceable (the bankruptcy estate shall always be given a right to fulfill the debtor's obligations according to a contract). If the bankruptcy estate steps into the contract

<<<

 and performance by the creditor is due, the creditor may demand that the bankruptcy estate performs its newly assumed obligations as well or, if a grace period has been granted, request that the bankruptcy estate, without unreasonable delay

<<<

, provides acceptable security for its performance. If performance by the creditor is not due, the creditor may request security where this is necessary in order to protect it against loss. If the bankruptcy estate does not step into the contract

<<<

 within a reasonable time after the creditor's demand or if it does not comply with the creditor's request to provide security, the creditor may terminate the contract.
Enforcement Process
In case of enforcement outside of bankruptcy proceedings

<<<

, in respect of real estate mortgages and business mortgages (f r e ta g sh y p o te k ) and (as relevant) assets in the possession of the relevant security provider, an enforcement process is initiated by the creditor obtaining an enforcement

<<<

 order from the Swedish
291

Enforcement Authority (Kronofogden) or the courts. Upon obtaining an enforcement order against a debtor, a creditor may apply to the Swedish Enforcement Authority for enforcement of its claim. In respect of certain

<<<

 other types of assets, such as over shares, receivables, bank accounts, trademarks and contractual rights, enforcement can be carried out by the security holder itself. A provision granting the secured party or its agent such right of enforcement

<<<

 is typically included in any pledge agreement between the pledgor and the secured party or its agent. The secured party is typically entitled to enforce the security through a sale of the collateral. However, certain restrictions apply to the

<<<

 procedure for such a sale. The pledgor should, if the circumstances are not exceptional, be given prior notice of the contemplated enforcement and also of the time and location of the sale. Furthermore, sufficient notice should be given to

<<<

 prospective purchasers in order to create reasonable preconditions for a market price being obtained in the sale. Where the secured party has been granted the right to enforce the security through a private sale, such sale must be made to a

<<<

 party unaffiliated with the secured party unless the market price of the security can be independently and objectively established and the security is sold at such price. Pledges over receivables and other claims are, if the receivable or claim

<<<

 has fallen due, normally enforced through the secured party collecting the payment as opposed to selling the receivable.
Enforcement of security in bankruptcy is also subject to certain restrictions. A holder of a real property mortgage, a

<<<

 business mortgage or security over specific assets in the possession of the relevant security provider may demand that is the relevant assets are sold by the receiver in bankruptcy without undue delay, provided the underlying claim is not disputed

<<<

 or has been confirmed in a non-appealable decision. This rule does not, however, apply to such assets as are necessary for the continuation of the debtor company's business. The receiver in bankruptcy may thus postpone such sale if the receiver

<<<

 in bankruptcy determines that the bankruptcy estate would either incur a considerable loss or that the implementation of a public composition proceeding (offentligt ackord) would become substantially more difficult, provided that a postponement

<<<

 is not unreasonable to the secured creditor. A creditor holding a possessory pledge over movable property (such as shares) may arrange for the sale of the movable property at a public auction (but not sell the moveable property privately unless

<<<

 the receiver in bankruptcy consents). However, financial instruments and currency are exempt from the requirement for the receiver in bankruptcy's consent. The secured party may either sell such financial instruments or currency immediately

<<<

 or assume ownership (against reduction of the secured debt with the market value of such assets or, if the market value of the assets exceeds the outstanding debt, against repayment to the debtor of the surplus), provided the realization is

<<<

 done in a commercially viable manner. Should the security granted consist of rights over unlisted shares in the subsidiary of the debtor, the receiver in bankruptcy must still be given an opportunity to redeem the shares prior to the sale or

<<<

 deduction.
Priority of Certain Creditors
As a general principle, under Swedish insolvency law competing claims have equal right to payment in relation to the size of the amount claimed from the debtor's assets. However, some preferential and

<<<

 secured creditors, where such preference or security may arise as a consequence of law, have the benefit of payment before all other creditors (in the case of preferential creditors only) and all unsecured creditors out of the assets that secure

<<<

 the creditors' claims (in the case of secured creditors only). There are two types of preferential rights: specific and general preferential rights. Specific preferential rights apply to certain specific property and give the creditor a right

<<<

 to payment from such property. General preferential rights cover all property belonging to the insolvent company's estate in bankruptcy, which is not covered by specific preferential rights, and give the creditor a right to payment from such

<<<

 property. Claims that do not carry any of the above-mentioned preferential rights or exceed the value of the security provided for such claim (to the extent of such excess), are non-preferential and are of equal standing as against each other

<<<

 (unless subordinated). A claim can be subordinated if, for instance, the creditor has entered into an agreement with the debtor stipulating such subordination.
Challengeable Transactions
In Swedish bankruptcy and, if certain conditions are

<<<

 met, company reorganization proceedings, transactions can (in certain circumstances and subject to a time limit) be reversed and the goods or monies can then be returned to the bankruptcy estate or the company subject to company reorganization

<<<

. Broadly, these transactions include, among others, situations where the debtor has conveyed property fraudulently or preferentially to one creditor to the detriment of its other creditors before the initiation of the relevant insolvency proceedings

<<<

, created a new security interest, granted a guarantee or security that was either not stipulated at the time when the secured obligation arose or not perfected without delay after such time and
292

the delay is not considered to be ordinary

<<<

, or paid a debt that is not due or that is considerable compared to the value of the debtor's assets or if the payment is made by using unusual means of payment. In the majority of situations, a claim for recovery can be made concerning actions

<<<

 that were made during the three or six months preceding the commencement of the relevant Swedish insolvency proceedings. In certain situations, longer time limits apply and in others there are no time limits. These include, among others, situations

<<<

 where the other party to an agreement or other arrangement is deemed to be a closely related party to the debtor such as a subsidiary or parent company.
Limitations on Enforceability Due to the Swedish Reorganization Act
The Swedish Reorganization

<<<

 Act (L a g (1 9 9 6 :7 6 4 ) o m fo r e ta g sr e k o n str u k tio n ) provides companies facing difficulties in meeting their payment obligations with an opportunity to resolve these difficulties without being declared bankrupt. A petition

<<<

 for company reorganization may be presented to the court by the debtor or a creditor of the debtor but a reorganization order may only be granted subject to the debtor's approval. Corporate reorganization proceedings shall, as a main rule,

<<<

 terminate within three months from commencement but may under certain conditions be extended for up to one year.
An administrator (re k o n stru k to r) is appointed by the court and supervises the day-to-day activities and safeguards the interests

<<<

 of creditors as well as the debtor. However, the debtor remains in full possession of the business except that the consent of the administrator is required for important decisions such as paying a debt that has fallen due prior to the granting

<<<

 of a reorganization order, granting security for a debt that arose prior to the granting of the reorganization order, undertaking new obligations or transferring, pledging or granting rights in respect of assets of a substantial value for the

<<<

 business. However, the absence of such consent does not affect the validity of the transaction (but may jeopardize the reorganization).
Upon the opening of corporate reorganization proceedings, the administrator must notify the creditors of

<<<

 the reorganization proceedings and will draw up a reorganization plan specifying the proposed action to be taken to resolve the debtor's difficulties. A creditors' meeting will be held at which the creditors will be given the opportunity to

<<<

 express their opinions as to whether the reorganization should continue. Upon the request of any of the creditors, the court shall appoint a creditors' committee of a maximum of three persons. The administrator shall, if possible, consult with

<<<

 the creditors' committee prior to taking any important decisions.
The corporate reorganization proceedings do not have the effect of terminating contracts entered into by the debtor. However, the opening of corporate reorganization proceedings

<<<

 entails limitations in the contracting party's right to terminate a contract due to the debtor's delay in payment or performance. Such limitations are similar to that which is stated above in respect of a bankruptcy estate's right to step into

<<<

 existing contracts. The limitations are not applicable where a creditor has security over, in ter a lia , financial instruments or receivables originating from a loan granted by a credit institution. During the reorganization procedure, the

<<<

 debtor's business activities continue in the ordinary course of business. However, the procedure includes a suspension of payments to creditors and the debtor may not pay a debt that fell due prior to the granting of the reorganization order

<<<

 without the consent of the administrator and such consent may only be granted should there be exceptional reasons for doing so and any petition for bankruptcy in respect of the debtor will be stayed. A moratorium also applies to execution in

<<<

 respect of a claim or enforcement of security during corporate reorganization proceedings unless the security assets are in the physical possession of the secured creditor or any agent acting on behalf of such creditor, which is the case with

<<<

 a Swedish law share pledge over the shares in a Swedish limited liability company where the share certificates of such company has been delivered to the secured creditor or its agent and with a Swedish law pledge over a loan governed by a negotiable

<<<

 debt instrument (lo p a n d e sk u ld e b re v ) where such negotiable debt instrument has been delivered to the secured creditor or its agent.
The debtor may apply to the courts requesting public composition proceedings (o ffen tlig t a c

<<<

 k o rd ) which means that the amount of a creditor's claim may be reduced on a percentage basis. The proposal for a public composition must meet certain requirements such as that a sufficient proportion of the creditors which are allowed to

<<<

 vote, in respect of a sufficient proportion of the outstanding claims vote in favor of such public composition. Creditors with set-off rights and secured creditors will not participate in the composition unless they wholly or partly waive their

<<<

 set-off rights or priority rights. Should the security not cover a secured creditor's full claim, the remaining claim will, however, be part of a composition. A creditors' meeting is convened to vote on the proposed composition. The public

<<<

 composition is binding on all creditors that were entitled to participate, i.e. also creditors who have not attended the creditors'
293

meeting will be bound. However, the obligations of a guarantor under a guarantee provided in respect of

<<<

 a creditor's claim which has been reduced by way of public composition will not be reduced correspondingly but will remain valid up to the original amount of such creditor's claim.
Liquidation due to capital deficiency
Pursuant to the Swedish

<<<

 Companies Act (a k tieb o la g sla g en (2005:551)), as amended (the ``Swedish Companies Act''), whenever a company's board of directors has a reason to assume that, as a result of losses or reductions in the value of the company's assets or

<<<

 any other event, the company's equity is less than half the registered share capital, the company's board of directors shall prepare a special balance sheet (k o n tro llb a la n sra k n in g ) and have the auditors examine it. The same obligation

<<<

 arises if the company in connection with enforcement pursuant to Chapter 4 of the Swedish Enforcement Code (u tso k n in g sb a lk e n (1981:774)) is found to lack seizeable assets.
If the special balance sheet shows that the equity of such

<<<

 company is less than half of the registered share capital, the board of directors shall, as soon as possible, issue notice to call a shareholders' meeting which shall consider whether the company shall go into liquidation (initial shareholders

<<<

' meeting). The special balance sheet and an auditor's report with respect thereto shall be presented at the initial shareholders' meeting.
If the special balance sheet presented at the initial shareholders' meeting fails to show that, on the

<<<

 date of such meeting, the equity of the company amounts to the registered share capital and the initial shareholders' meeting has not resolved that the company shall go into liquidation, the shareholders' meeting shall, within eight months

<<<

 of the initial shareholders' meeting, reconsider the issue whether the company shall go into liquidation (second shareholders' meeting). Prior to the second shareholders' meeting, the board of directors shall prepare a new special balance sheet

<<<

 and cause such to be reviewed by the company's auditors. The new special balance sheet and an auditor's report thereon shall be presented at the second shareholders' meeting.
A shareholders' resolution on liquidation of the company shall be

<<<

 registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office (B o la g sv e rk e t), which shall appoint a liquidator. Should the shareholders not resolve on such voluntary liquidation where required (which is where (i) a second shareholders'

<<<

 meeting is not held within the period of time stated above, or (ii) the new special balance sheet which was presented at the second shareholders' meeting was not reviewed by the company's auditor or fails to show that, on the date of such meeting

<<<

, the equity of the company amounts to at least the registered share capital), the court may put the company into compulsory liquidation and appoint a liquidator. The liquidator takes over management and control of the company and shall sell

<<<

 the company's assets and settle the company's debts with the proceeds. The liquidator shall give notice to the company's unknown creditors and creditors that have not lodged their claims with the liquidator within six months following such

<<<

 notice will have forfeited their rights to their claims.
Limitations on the Value of a Guarantee or Security Interest
A Swedish limited liability company may not provide a guarantee or security for the obligations of a parent or sister company

<<<

, unless they belong to the same group of companies and the parent company of that group is domiciled within the EEA. Furthermore, if a Swedish limited liability company provides any security interest or guarantee without receiving sufficient

<<<

 corporate benefit in return, such security interest or guarantee will, in whole or in part, be considered a distribution of assets, which will be lawful only (i) to the extent there is sufficient coverage for the restricted equity capital of

<<<

 the Swedish limited liability company after the distribution (i.e., at the time the guarantee is provided or the security is granted) and (ii) if considered prudent by the Swedish limited liability company to undertake such distribution after

<<<

 having taken into consideration the equity requirements imposed by the nature, scope and risks relating to the Swedish limited liability company's business or the Swedish limited liability company's need to strengthen its balance sheet, liquidity

<<<

 or financial position in general. Where the Swedish limited liability company is a parent company, the latter assessment is made also on a group level.
A security granted for a another party's obligation may also, in certain circumstances,

<<<

 be deemed to constitute a distribution of assets if, at the time the security interest is provided, the obligor of such obligation could be deemed unable to fulfill its obligation to indemnify the Swedish limited liability company if the security

<<<

 is enforced or if the security provider does not otherwise receive corporate benefit.
294

It should also be noted that laws relating to financial assistance in Sweden prohibit limited liability companies incorporated in Sweden from providing

<<<

 guarantees or granting security or other credit support for obligations of any person where such obligations are being incurred for the purpose of acquiring shares in the company itself or in any other superior member of the same Swedish group

<<<

 of companies.
The Note Guarantees of and security granted by the Guarantors incorporated in Sweden are limited in accordance with the above restrictions relating to prohibited security, distribution of assets and financial assistance and are

<<<

 subject to limitation language limiting the liability of such entities thereunder to the extent required by the above restrictions.
Creation of Valid Security Interests
In order to create a valid security interest under Swedish law: (a) there

<<<

 must be an underlying debtorcreditor relationship in respect of the obligations which the security interest purports to secure; (b) the pledgor must grant the security interest, typically in the form of a pledge agreement; and (c) an act perfecting

<<<

 the security interest must take place. The method for perfection varies depending on the asset type.
Under Swedish law, and in addition to formal perfection requirements, the creation of valid security interests over certain classes of assets

<<<

 is predicated on the security provider being effectively deprived of its right to control, deal with or dispose of the assets subject to the security interest. Any security interests purported to be created under Swedish law over assets (other

<<<

 than security over assets represented by, including but not limited to, mortgage certificates, business mortgage certificates and share certificates, in each case provided that such certificates have been delivered to the secured party or its

<<<

 agent) which, prior to the occurrence of an enforcement event, remain in the possession of the security provider or over which the security provider retains control or in respect of which the security provider can freely operate or collect

<<<

, invest and dispose of any income deriving therefrom would not be effective as against third parties until an enforcement event had in fact occurred and the control and rights are effectively taken from the security provider. Such delayed perfection

<<<

 of security interests are vulnerable under applicable provisions of Swedish law to being set aside as a preference in any Swedish insolvency proceeding affecting the security provider. Thus, a security provider must be effectively deprived

<<<

 of its right to control, deal with or dispose of the applicable secured assets, and arrangements providing for the release of a security interest over such an asset in connection with the disposal thereof or upon the occurrence of other circumstances

<<<

 would be at risk of impairing the validity of the security. To ensure validity of security interests despite the inclusion of such arrangements in the relevant documentation, such rights to sell or otherwise dispose of the security assets must

<<<

 either be subject to the consent of the security agent in its sole discretion or all proceeds of a disposal should be applied towards prepayment of the indebtedness which is secured by the security interests being released. It should be noted

<<<

 that the security interests granted under the account pledge agreements, the share pledge agreements (in relation to dividends), the receivables pledge agreements and contractual rights pledge agreements governed by Swedish law are constructed

<<<

 with delayed perfection and consequently, the delayed security interests under such pledge agreements may be vulnerable to be set aside as a preference in accordance with the above.
Foreign Currency
Whereas Swedish courts may award judgments

<<<

 in currencies other than Swedish kronor, judgments will be enforced in Swedish kronor, generally at the rate of exchange prevailing at the date of enforcement rather than at the date of judgment.
Security Granted in Favour of an Agent
It is

<<<

 generally possible under Swedish law to grant security interests in favor of an agent acting on behalf of the secured parties. However, it is not established by judicial precedent or otherwise by law that a power of attorney or a mandate of

<<<

 agency, including the appointment of an agent (including any agent for service of process), can be made irrevocable. Therefore, any powers of attorney or mandates of agency can be revoked and will terminate by operation of law and without notice

<<<

 at the bankruptcy or temporal demise of the party giving such powers.
Stamp Duty
No Swedish stamp duty will be payable on the granting of the Note Guarantees and/or first priority security interests by the Swedish Guarantors or security providers

<<<

, but may however be payable should the Swedish
295

Guarantors or security providers be obliged to take out new real property mortgage certificates (in teck n in g i f a s t e g e n d o m ) or new business mortgage certificates (fo r e ta

<<<

 g sin te c k n in g ) in their respective businesses. Swedish stamp duty will be payable in connection with any sale of real property in Sweden (save for certain exempted transactions).
Trust
Currently, Swedish law does not contain any provisions

<<<

 for trusts to be formed and trustees to be appointed. While Swedish law does not know the concept of trust, it is generally believed that a trustee that has been appointed under foreign law, provided that a trustee is capable of being appointed

<<<

 under the laws governing such appointment, will be recognized and acknowledged in Sweden in that such an appointed trustee may be able to claim and enforce or procure the enforcement of the rights of the beneficiaries under the trust, subject

<<<

 to the terms of the relevant documents. In order for a secured creditor to empower a trustee to represent them in Swedish courts, the secured creditor may have to submit a written power of attorney in favor of the trustee for legal proceedings

<<<

. The failure to submit such a power of attorney could negatively affect the enforcement of the security. However, Swedish tax law does not have any special tax provisions regarding trusts and we express no opinion on whether instruments setting

<<<

 up a trust under the foreign laws would be enforceable for Swedish tax purposes.
Parallel Debt
The concept of parallel debt arrangements is not generally recognized under Swedish law and any agreement or document may not be enforceable to the

<<<

 extent it purports to effect such arrangements.
Poland
Applicable Insolvency Law
One of the Guarantors is incorporated in Poland.
As a general rule, insolvency proceedings with respect to any Guarantor with its registered office and its center

<<<

 of main interest in Poland should be subject to the jurisdiction of Polish courts, which will apply the Polish Bankruptcy and Rehabilitation Law of February 28, 2003 (consolidated text in the Journal of Laws (D z ie n n ik U sta w ) of 201

<<<

2, Item 1112, as amended, the "B a n k ru p tc y L a w " ).
Pursuant to the Bankruptcy Law, a declaration of bankruptcy shall be issued by a court in respect of a debtor who has become insolvent, i.e., the debtor fails to fulfill its due and

<<<

 payable pecuniary obligations and/or, (in respect of a legal entity with legal personality (o so b o w o sc p r a w n a ), or legal entity which has no legal personality, but according to the law, it has legal capacity, i.e., the ability to

<<<

 enter into transactions and to be the subject of rights and obligations (z d o ln o s C p r a w n a )) where its obligations are in excess of the value of its assets, even if it is able to discharge these obligations on time. Therefore, if

<<<

 the obligations of a Guarantor incorporated in Poland (a "P o lish G u a ra n to r") under its Note Guarantee exceed the value of that Polish Guarantor's assets, such Polish Guarantor will be automatically regarded as insolvent and the management

<<<

 board of such Polish Guarantor will be obliged to file for bankruptcy.
A bankruptcy petition may be filed by a debtor or any of his creditors. In the case of a legal person, it may also be filed by anyone who is entitled to represent the same

<<<

, individually or jointly with other persons. The debtor is obliged to file a bankruptcy petition with the court within two weeks from the day on which the grounds for the declaration of bankruptcy arose.
The insolvency proceedings may be carried

<<<

 out in two ways: (i) proceedings with the possibility of an arrangement (an arrangement may also provide for the satisfaction of creditors through liquidation of the bankrupt's assets) (``A rra n g e m e n t P ro c e e d in g s"); or (ii) proceedings

<<<

 involving the liquidation of the debtor's assets (``L iq u id a tio n P ro c e e d in g s"). The Arrangement Proceedings are conducted with respect to the debtor, where it has been credibly established that the creditors' claims will be satisfied

<<<

 to a larger extent than they would be in Liquidation Proceedings. In the Arrangement Proceedings, certain claims are not subject to a potential arrangement (in particular, without limitation, claims secured on the bankrupt entity's assets by

<<<

 mortgage, pledge, registered pledge or transfer of title to movables, receivables or other rights are not subject to arrangement, however only to the extent covered by the value of assets on which security was established). Notwithstanding

<<<

 the foregoing, a creditor whose claims are so secured may consent to being subject to an arrangement. The court may change the manner of conducting the insolvency proceedings from the Arrangement Proceedings into the Liquidation Proceedings

<<<

 and vice
296

versa, if the grounds for conducting a given type of the proceedings have become known after the declaration of bankruptcy.
Provisions of any agreement which stipulate that such an agreement will be terminated and/or amended

<<<

 upon bankruptcy of one of the parties are invalid. Also, provisions of an agreement to which the bankrupt entity is a party which hinder or prevent the objectives of the insolvency proceedings, will be deemed ineffective in relation to the

<<<

 bankruptcy estate. These specific provisions of Polish law are deemed to be forcing their jurisdiction with respect to provisions of the kind as referred to above also over contracts that are subject to laws other than the laws of Poland, as

<<<

 long as said provisions of such contract would apply to an entity that is subject to bankruptcy proceedings under Polish bankruptcy law.
Following a declaration of bankruptcy, any debt (claim) payable in a currency other than zloty and included

<<<

 in the list of claims, regardless of whether it has become due or not, must be converted into zloty at the National Bank of Poland's average exchange rate prevailing on the date of the declaration of bankruptcy. Accordingly, in the event of

<<<

 bankruptcy of a Guarantor, its creditors, including holders of Notes, may be subject to an exchange rate risk between the date of the declaration of bankruptcy and the date of receipt of any amounts in the course of insolvency proceedings.

<<<


Following the declaration of bankruptcy, any debt of a debtor, including a debt of a Guarantor in respect of the Notes or the Parallel Debt, may be paid only after certain debts that are entitled to priority have been satisfied. Such preferential

<<<

 debts include, among other things, money owed to the State Treasury of Poland in respect of taxes or social security contributions or unpaid remuneration owed to employees. However, any debt secured by mortgage and/or registered pledge will

<<<

 be satisfied from the encumbered assets with priority over unsecured creditors.
Although it is not entirely clear, it is expected that the Polish courts and/or a bankruptcy estate administrator (z a r z g d c a ) and/or a court receiver (n

<<<

 a d zo r c a s g d o w y ) and/or a bankruptcy trustee (sy n d y k ) (unless otherwise specifically stated, hereinafter the term "bankruptcy estate administrator'' shall include each of z a r z g d c a , n a d zo r c a sg d o w y and/or s y

<<<

 n d y k ) will not give effect to any priority of claims agreed in intercreditor agreements and/or subordination agreements. There is a risk that, in the course of insolvency proceedings, claims of all unsecured creditors will be discharged

<<<

 on ap a r i p a s s u basis, irrespectively of any intercreditor agreements and/or subordination agreements, and the creditors who are parties to such agreements may have to enforce their rights thereunder outside of the insolvency proceedings

<<<

 (e.g. by claiming the return of particular amounts from other creditors who are parties to such intercreditor agreements and/or subordination agreements).
Following a declaration of bankruptcy in respect of a Guarantor, the following would

<<<

 be recognized, by operation of law, as ineffective against the Guarantor's bankruptcy estate:
 any transaction of the Guarantor, including its guarantee, if such transaction was executed within one year prior to filing of the motion to declare

<<<

 the Guarantor bankrupt and to the extent that such transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, i.e., the Guarantor disposed of or encumbered its assets for no consideration or for a consideration where the value of the Guarantor's performance

<<<

 was glaringly higher than the consideration received by the Guarantor or reserved for a third party; the above restriction does not apply to security interests created before the date of the declaration of bankruptcy in connection with certain

<<<

 financial term contracts (te r m in o w e o p e ra c je fin a n s o w e ) borrowing of financial instruments (p o z y c z k a in stru m e n to w fin a n s o w y c h ) or repo contracts in financial instruments (s p r z e d a z in s tr u m e

<<<

 n to w fin a n s o w y c h z e z o b o w ia z a n ie m d o ic h o d k u p u ), provided such contracts satisfy certain conditions set out in the Bankruptcy Law;
 security interests established by the Guarantor or the payment by the Guarantor

<<<

 of a debt not yet due if the security was established or the payment was made within two months prior to the filing of the motion to declare the Guarantor bankrupt; however, the holder of the respective security or a recipient of payment may

<<<

 file a lawsuit or plea seeking the assertion of effectiveness of the respective security or the payment, if at the time of execution of the transaction that holder or recipient was not aware of the existing grounds for declaring the Guarantor

<<<

's bankruptcy; the above restriction does not apply to security interests created before the date of the declaration of bankruptcy in connection with certain financial term contracts (te rm in o w e o p e ra c je fin a n s o w e ), borrowing

<<<

 of financial instruments (p o z y c z k a in s tr u m e n to w fin a n s o w y c h ) or repo contracts financial instruments (s p r z e d a z in s tr u m e n to w fin a n s o w y c h z e z o b o w ia z a n ie m d o ic h o d k u p u ), provided

<<<

 such contracts satisfy certain conditions set out in the Bankruptcy Law; and
297

 any transactions if entered into within six months prior to the filing of the motion to declare the Guarantor bankrupt and to the extent they were entered

<<<

 into with entities related to the Guarantor: (i) the Guarantor's shareholders, their representatives and/or relatives; or (ii) affiliated companies, their shareholders, and/or representatives or relatives of such shareholders; and/or (iii)

<<<

 the Guarantor's subsidiary or holding companies.
Further, the judge commissioner may, under a motion from the bankruptcy estate administrator declare any encumbrances (security interests) established over the assets of the Guarantor (such as

<<<

 mortgages, pledges, registered pledges, etc.) ineffective towards the bankruptcy estate, to the extent that the Guarantor was not the personal (direct) obligor with respect to the underlying debt and if the encumbrance was established within

<<<

 one year prior to the filing of the motion to declare the Guarantor bankrupt and the Guarantor received no consideration or the consideration received was glaringly low compared to the value of the encumbrance. However, irrespective of the

<<<

 value of the consideration received, the judge commissioner will decide that the security interests established over the assets of the bankrupt entity are ineffective towards the bankruptcy estate if they secure obligations of an entity related

<<<

 to the bankrupt entity: (i) the Guarantor's shareholders, their representatives and/or relatives; (ii) affiliated companies, their shareholders, and/or representatives or relatives of such shareholders; and/ or (iii) the Guarantor's subsidiary

<<<

 or holding companies. Under Polish bankruptcy law, once bankruptcy of a company is declared by the relevant court no new encumbrances over such bankrupt company's assets may be established. This means that a registered pledge will not be entered

<<<

 into the relevant register of pledges post-bankruptcy, even if the registered pledge agreement had been entered into (and the application for filing had been submitted to the relevant court) before bankruptcy was declared. This limitation would

<<<

 not apply to mortgages in relation to which the application for filing had been submitted more than six months before the bankruptcy was declared.
Agreement on the security assignment of a thing, receivable or of another right is effective

<<<

 towards the bankruptcy estate if it was executed with a so-called ``date certain'' (i.e., date certified by a notary). A creditor who benefits from such a security assignment may not request that the assigned right or asset be excluded from

<<<

 the bankruptcy estate. It will have, however, priority in satisfying its claim from the proceeds of the liquidation of such rights or assets.
The security interest created by any Guarantor incorporated in Poland may be held to be wholly or

<<<

 partly invalid as a result of the opening of insolvency proceedings, within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation against such Guarantor in another Member State or as a result of the Polish courts being required, under that Regulation

<<<

, to give effect to the law of that Member State or to recognize or enforce any judgment of a court of that Member State concerning those proceedings.
Polish Civil Code
Under the Polish Civil Code of April 23, 1964 (Journal of Laws (D zie n

<<<

 n ik U sta w ) of 1964, No. 16, Item 93, as amended), a creditor may request the court to declare a transaction (e.g., the granting of a guarantee or security or any disposal of assets) of such creditor's debtor ineffective towards such creditor

<<<

 if a third party obtains a benefit as a result of such transaction to the detriment of the debtor's creditors provided that the debtor acted with the knowledge of such detriment and the third-party beneficiary (a) knew of that fact or could

<<<

 have known if it exercised due care or (b) obtained the benefit for no consideration. A transaction is to the detriment of creditors if, as a result of such transaction, the debtor becomes insolvent or becomes insolvent to a greater extent

<<<

.
In addition, if a debtor's entering into a given agreement made it wholly or partially impossible to satisfy a third party's claim, such third party may request that the court declare such agreement ineffective towards that third party, provided

<<<

 that the debtor and the other party to the agreement knew of the third party's claim or if the agreement was for no consideration.
Preservation of Capital
The Commercial Companies Code of September 15, 2000 (Journal of Laws (D zie n n ik U

<<<

 sta w ) of 2000, No. 94, Item 1037, as amended; Article 189) (the ``C o m m e r c ia l C o m p a n ie s C o d e ") restricts limited liability companies (sp o lk a z o g ra n ic zo n g o d p o w ie d z ia ln o s c ia ), such as Paroc Polska

<<<

 sp. z o.o., a Polish Guarantor, from making any payments to their shareholders (under any legal title) from their assets which are necessary to cover their share capital. This provision is not very clear but it is assumed that it forbids any

<<<

 payments to the shareholders as a result of which the assets of the company would become (or continue to
298

be) less than the nominal value of its share capital. In certain circumstances, a parent of a limited liability who obtained a benefit

<<<

, might be obligated to return such benefits to this Polish limited liability company.
Registration of Security
The establishment and perfection of certain security instruments in Poland, in particular registered pledges and mortgages, requires

<<<

 the execution of certain documents and entry in certain registers. A registered pledge is effective at the actual date of registration. A mortgage is created at the registration with the back effect from the date of filing the application to

<<<

 the court. Registration proceedings can last up to three weeks. Registered pledges and mortgages have priority in the order they were registered, unless agreed otherwise. To the extent that the security grantor has tax obligations in Poland

<<<

, registered pledge may be encumbered with a treasury lien for the benefit of the State Treasury. It is a standard market practice that until the entry of the pledge in the register, the payment obligations are secured by a financial pledge

<<<

 over shares, which does not give the same scope of rights to secured creditors as the registered pledge in terms of protection against unauthorized transfers and subsequent charges.
Effectiveness of Security
In general, financial pledges contemplated

<<<

 in the relevant Security Documents will become effective upon notification to the relevant debtor. The pledge will not be effective against the company unless and until such notification is made.
Generally, the establishment of a registered

<<<

 pledge will not prevent third-party creditors of the security grantor from initiating enforcement proceedings to satisfy their claims. In such event, the Security Agent will have the right to participate in the distribution of funds resulting

<<<

 from such enforcement and its claims will have priority over unsecured claims of third parties (except for certain court-enforcement expenses, alimony claims and employee and pension claims) and claims secured with the lower-ranking pledges

<<<

 according to the order of priorities set forth in accordance with applicable law.
Under Polish law, pledges and mortgages are considered an accessory to the underlying secured obligations, which automatically terminate if the secured obligations

<<<

 have been satisfied, become void or otherwise expire or, in general, the pledge/mortgage is released by the pledgee/mortgagee.
Parallel Debt
Parallel debt as a concept has been considered and accepted by Polish courts in the context of foreign

<<<

-law debts, even though the concept is not valid under Polish law per se.
Application of Foreign Law
If any obligation is to be performed in a jurisdiction outside Poland, it might not be enforceable in Poland to the extent that such performance

<<<

 would be illegal or contrary to public policy under the laws of the other jurisdiction. Polish courts may take into account the law of the place of performance when evaluating the manner of performance and the steps to be taken in the event

<<<

 of defective performance. No law of any other jurisdiction will apply in the Republic of Poland if its application would have an effect that is contrary to the public policy in the Republic of Poland.
Consents and Notification
An exercise of

<<<

 voting rights in a company by a holder of the relevant security under the power of attorney may be recognized as change of control pursuant to the Act on Protection of Competition and Consumers (uniform text, Journal of Laws dated 2003, No

<<<

. 86, item 804) ("Competition Law"). Therefore, the holder of such security may be obliged to notify the Polish Office for Protection of Competition and Consumers about its intention to exercise its voting rights. Further, it may be required

<<<

 to obtain an anti-monopoly clearance to exercise such voting rights.
The enforcement of a registered pledge through the appropriation of the shares by the Security Agent may be recognized as a notifiable merger under the Competition Law. Therefore

<<<

, the holder of the relevant Security Interest may be required to notify the Polish Office for Protection of Competition and Consumers about its intention to take over the shares. Further, it may be required to obtain an antimonopoly clearance

<<<

 to take over the shares.

 amended. Council regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000 as of 29 May 2000 on insolvency proceedings is also applicable.
The ability to receive payments on the Notes under any Note Guarantee issued by a Lithuanian entity may be negatively affected by

<<<

 the relevant Guarantor's insolvency. Under Lithuanian laws, a petition for bankruptcy may be filed with the court if any of the below exists:
(a) an entity delays the payment of salaries and employment-related amounts;
(b) an entity delays

<<<

 the payment for the goods delivered, services provided or fails to repay the credits when due or fails to perform other contractual obligations when due;
(c) an entity delays the payment of taxes, other levies and charges or amounts adjudicated

<<<

 by a court;
(d) an entity publicly announced or otherwise informed its creditor about the inability or unwillingness to perform the obligation; or
(e) an entity has no assets or income that could be used to execute (enforce) the debt and due

<<<

 to this reason a bailiff returned the writs of execution to a creditor.
The following persons have a right to file a petition for bankruptcy with the court:
(a) the creditors;
(b) the owner/owners (a shareholder/shareholders whose shares represent

<<<

 over 10% of voting rights); or
(c) the head of the enterprise.
A bankruptcy case (proceedings) is instituted if the court determines that any of the following conditions exist:
(a) an entity is insolvent or an entity is in arrears with the

<<<

 payment of salaries and employment-related amounts to its employees. Under Lithuanian law, insolvency of an entity occurs when it fails to settle its obligations (fails to settle the debts, perform obligation for which the remuneration has

<<<

 been received in advance, etc.) and when the obligations of an entity that are overdue (unsettled debts, unperformed works, etc.) exceed half of the value of the assets on the enterprise's balance sheet; or
(b) an entity publicly announced

<<<

 or otherwise informed its creditor about the inability or unwillingness to perform the obligation.
If the court institutes bankruptcy proceedings, the court must determine the period within which creditors' claims must be submitted for approval

<<<

. This period may not exceed 45 days after the decision to institute the bankruptcy comes into force. Creditors acquire their rights as creditors in the bankruptcy process only after the court approves their claims and registers them on the

<<<

 creditors' list. If a creditor fails to submit their claim within the specified term, the court may approve the claim, but only if the creditor proves to the court that the there was good cause for their failure to submit their claim in a timely

<<<

 fashion.
According to Lithuanian bankruptcy laws, the bankruptcy process of an entity registered in Lithuania is to be governed by Lithuanian law and Lithuanian courts are to try related cases. The bankruptcy process can be carried out either

<<<

 in a judicial or an extrajudicial way.
The extrajudicial bankruptcy process can be chosen provided that no action has been brought in court in which claims, including claims connected with employment relationship, have been raised against the

<<<

 company and provided no execution is levied on the company under the writs of execution issued by the courts or other institutions (such as in a notary public, prosecutor, other institutions and officials). A decision to carry out extrajudicial

<<<

 bankruptcy procedures may be taken by a creditors' meeting if the creditors, whose claims in terms of value account for at least 75% of the amount of the company's liabilities on the day of adoption of the decision, including those which have

<<<

 not yet matured, vote in favour of such procedure.
It is important to note that the ability to receive payment on the Notes under a Note Guarantee issued by a Lithuanian entity may be adversely affected by the following provision of the Lithuanian

<<<

 law governing the bankruptcy process under which, after the court (or creditors' meeting) decision to institute bankruptcy
300

proceedings becomes effective, a discharge of financial obligations not discharged prior to the institution of

<<<

 bankruptcy proceedings, including payment of interest, penalties, taxes and other mandatory payments, or recovery of debts from the company through the court or without suit, except for set-off, where such set-off is permitted under the provisions

<<<

 of set-off of tax overpayment (difference) provided for in tax legislation, shall be prohibited. The computation of penalties and interest on all obligations of the company, including default interest related to the employment relationships

<<<

, is suspended. The Company shall be entitled to engage itself in economic and commercial activities, provided they reduce the losses of creditors incurred due to bankruptcy institution, and use the income received from such activities to cover

<<<

 the expenses related to these activities. No forced mortgage may be imposed on the company's assets. Furthermore, upon a creditors' request, the court may impose restrictions on the Guarantor's economiccommercial activities any disposal of

<<<

 its assets and determine that assets may be sold, leased, pledged, used as a surety or a guarantee for the discharge of third person's liabilities or otherwise transferred only with a permission of the court. Debt subordination agreements may

<<<

 not be enforceable in case of bankruptcy, because parties may not change the priority of creditors prescribed by the Lithuanian law.
A bankruptcy administrator must examine the transactions entered by the company under bankruptcy in the period

<<<

 of 36 months (or in the case of intentional bankruptcy, in the period of 60 months) prior to the institution of the bankruptcy proceedings and must challenge those transactions that are contrary to the objectives of the company's activities

<<<

 and/or which could have led to the inability of the company to settle with creditors.
During a bankruptcy process the creditors' claims secured by pledge/mortgage are satisfied from the sale proceeds of these pledged/mortgaged assets or from

<<<

 the transfer of the pledged/mortgaged assets to the secured creditor. If the pledged/mortgaged assets are insufficient to satisfy the entire claim of the secured creditor, the unsatisfied part of such creditor's claim will be settled in the

<<<

 same procedure as of unsecured creditors. If a creditor holds financial collateral created pursuant to the Act on Financial Collateral Arrangements (IX-2127, Finansinio uztikrinimo susitarimu istatymas), implementing requirements of Council

<<<

 Directive 47/02 EC on Financial Collateral Arrangements, (``Financial Collateral") in respect of the bankrupt company, the creditor may set off such Financial Collateral against its claims against the bankrupt company notwithstanding the initiated

<<<

 bankruptcy proceeding. Financial Collateral is not publicly registered and is common in practice as security provided to financial institutions. Financial Collateral is regulated by the Act on Financial Collateral Arrangements. The claims of

<<<

 unsecured creditors are satisfied in two stages.
During the first stage, creditors' claims excluding interest and penalties are satisfied, while in the second stage the remaining part of the creditors' claims (interest and penalties) are settled

<<<

. All creditors' claims are settled in the following sequence prescribed by the Lithuanian bankruptcy laws:
(a) firstly, the claims of the employees arising from employment relationship, claims for occupational injuries or death due to accidents

<<<

 at work and claims for the agricultural products bought for the processing purposes are settled;
(b) secondly, claims related to taxes, charges for compulsory state social insurance and health insurance, claims related to foreign loans granted

<<<

 from the funds borrowed by the State or guaranteed by the State as well as related to the EU support are satisfied;
(c) thirdly, all other claims of creditors are settled.
Each lower level of creditors' claims is satisfied only after all creditors

<<<

' claims of upper levels are fully satisfied. If the company's assets are insufficient to satisfy all creditors; claims on the same level, then the claims of the same level are satisfied in proportion to the size of a claim.
Expenses relating

<<<

 to administration of the company in bankruptcy shall be paid first of all from all types of funds of the company in bankruptcy (proceeds from the sale of assets of the company, including pledged assets, debts repaid to the company, earnings

<<<

 from economic activities, rent of property and other funds received in the course of bankruptcy proceedings).
In the case of a Guarantor's bankruptcy, the claims under the Note Guarantees not secured by pledge/ mortgage would fall under the

<<<

 last (third) level of satisfaction of claims as referred to above.
Restructuring Proceedings
The ability to receive payments on the Notes under a Note Guarantee issued by a Lithuanian entity may be negatively affected if restructuring proceedings

<<<

 are started against a Guarantor. The restructuring is the
301

process targeted at preserving business, paying debts and avoiding bankruptcy by the companies having financial difficulties, provided they have not stopped their business. The

<<<

 company is considered as having financial difficulties if it may not settle its liabilities and reduce losses leading to termination of its business and going bankrupt. During the restructuring process the company's business is sought to be

<<<

 preserved by deploying economic, technical, organizational and other means and receiving support from the company's creditors. The restructuring proceeding may be started if all the below conditions exist:
(a) the company has financial difficulties

<<<

 or there is a probability that it will have financial difficulties in the nearest 3 months;
(b) the company has not stopped its business;
(c) the company is not under bankruptcy or bankrupt;
(d) the company has been incorporated at least 3

<<<

 years before the application for the restructuring proceedings is filed;
(e) at least 5 years have passed since the expiration or termination of the last restructuring of the company.
The restructuring proceedings are instituted by a court

<<<

 ruling. The decision to apply to court for the institution of the restructuring proceedings is passed by the company's general meeting of shareholders. Between the institution of the restructuring proceedings until the approval of the restructuring

<<<

 plan the company may not perform any liabilities or obligations that arose before the institution of the restructuring proceedings, transfer its assets, apply set-off, etc., the calculation of interest and default interest is stopped and the

<<<

 execution under the execution writs is stopped.
The court ruling must state the term within which the creditors must submit their claims. This term may not be less than 30 days and may not be longer than 45 days from the date the ruling to

<<<

 start restructuring comes into force. Generally the term may not be restored, and therefore if the creditor fails to submit their claim within this term, it may lose the ability to satisfy its claim.
The main document regulating the payments

<<<

 of the company during the restructuring is the restructuring plan approved by the company's general meeting of shareholders, the creditors having at least 2/3 of all creditors' claims and the court. Lithuanian law establishes the procedure

<<<

 of satisfaction of creditors' claims. The creditors' claims secured by pledge/mortgage are satisfied from the sale proceeds of these pledged/mortgaged assets. If the creditor holds Financial Collateral in respect of the company under restructuring

<<<

, the creditor may immediately use the Financial Collateral to satisfy its claims against the debtor (by way of set-off). The claims of other creditors are satisfied in two stages. During the first stage creditors' claims excluding interest

<<<

 and penalties are satisfied, while in the second stage the remaining part of the creditors' claims (interest and penalties) are settled. All creditors' claims are settled in the following sequence prescribed by Lithuanian law:
(a) firstly,

<<<

 the claims of the employees arising from employment relationship, claims for occupational injuries or death due to accidents at work and claims for the agricultural products bought for the processing purposes and the claims of secured creditors

<<<

, not exceeding the value of the pledged/ mortgaged assets not sold during the restructuring process, are settled;
(b) secondly, claims of all other creditors are satisfied (except for claims indicated in a third level below and claims of the

<<<

 creditors providing the new loans to the company during the restructuring process not secured by pledge/mortgage);
(c) thirdly, claims of the company's shareholders controlling the company not related to the employment relationship are settled

<<<

.
Each lower level of creditors' claims is satisfied only after all creditors' claims of upper levels are fully satisfied. If the company's assets are insufficient to satisfy all creditors; claims on the same level, then the claims of the same

<<<

 level are satisfied in proportion to the size of a claim. The claims of the creditors that have not matured until the institution of the restructuring proceeding may be settled not earlier than upon their maturity. Debt subordination agreements

<<<

 might not be enforceable in case of bankruptcy, because parties may not change the priority of the creditors prescribed by Lithuanian law.
The restructuring may last no longer than four years but extensions are possible.
302

Grant of Guarantees

<<<

 and Security Interests
Under the general concept of Lithuanian law a Lithuanian company may offer collateral or issue a guarantee or surety to secure the fulfillment of the third person's liabilities provided corporate benefit exits for that

<<<

 Lithuanian company. Guarantees and Security Documents with no corporate benefit for the guarantor may be declared void by the court.
The Company Law of Lithuania (No. VIII-1835, Akciniy bendroviy istatymas) prohibits limited liability companies

<<<

 incorporated in Lithuania from providing guarantees or granting security or other credit support for obligations of any person where such obligations are being incurred for the purpose of acquiring shares in the company itself.
Under Lithuanian

<<<

 law, decisions to offer surety or guarantee for the discharge of obligations of third persons, as well as decisions to pledge the fixed assets of the company, the amount of which exceeds 5% of the share capital of the company are passed by

<<<

 the management board of the company (or, where no management board is formed, by the head of the company), except as otherwise provided for in the articles of association. The articles of association may require prior approval of the above

<<<

 by the meeting of shareholders and/or the supervisory board. Such prior approval, however, does not eliminate the liability of the management for the transaction entered.
As a general rule, transactions made by the managing bodies of a company

<<<

 in breach of the competence conferred on them by the incorporation documents or law may be declared void only if it is proved that the counterparty acted in bad faith (i.e., such party knew or should have known that the management bodies were

<<<

 acting ultra vires). The fact of public announcement of the founding documents of the company is not a sufficient proof of the counterparty's bad faith. Therefore, the company is bound to prove that the counterparty acted in bad faith deliberately

<<<

.
A transaction may be challenged if it is entered into to cover up another transaction (i.e., if the parties intended to enter into a transaction different from the simulated transaction). Similarly, a transaction may be challenged if it was

<<<

 entered due to material mistake or a party's consent to make a transaction was obtained by fraud, extorted by duress, economic pressure or induced by threat. Likewise, a transaction made by the malicious agreement of an agent of one party with

<<<

 the other party, or a transaction entered into because of abusive circumstances may be declared void by the court.
A creditor may challenge a transaction made by a debtor, if the debtor was not obliged to enter into it and that transaction

<<<

 violates the rights of the creditor and the debtor knew or ought to have known that. The creditor's rights were considered violated if (a) as a result of such a transaction the debtor became insolvent, (b) the debtor, being insolvent, granted

<<<

 preference to another creditor, or (c) the rights of the creditor were infringed in any other way.
Lithuanian law draws distinction between a guarantee and a surety. The liability of a guarantor under a guarantee depends on the validity of

<<<

 the principal secured obligation and is limited to the amount indicated in the guarantee. The guarantor's obligation to pay under the guarantee arises according to the terms of the guarantee. The liability of the surety provider under the surety

<<<

 may be either joint and several or several. In the case of several liability, the enforcement must firstly be sought from the original debtor (the Issuer) and only if the original debtor is not able to settle the debts, the enforcement may

<<<

 be sought from the surety provider (as the case may be). In case of joint and several liability, the enforcement may be sought from either the original debtor or the surety provider or both. The obligations under the Note Guarantees may be

<<<

 enforced only if the obligations under the Notes have matured. Therefore, if the relevant Guarantor goes bankrupt and the Issuer has not yet become obligated to fulfill under the Notes, the liability under the Notes becomes unsecured.
Under

<<<

 Lithuanian law a mortgage or pledge gives security (benefit) only to those creditors who are indicated in a pledge or mortgage agreement (pledgees). If one authorised person (e.g., the Security Agent) represents several creditors, then by the

<<<

 agreement of the creditors the pledge/mortgage agreement may stipulate that only that authorised person will be indicated as a creditor in the Mortgage Register of the Republic of Lithuania. In this case the representation ground should be

<<<

 indicated in the Mortgage Register of the Republic of Lithuania. Though Lithuanian law permits certain types of pledge or mortgage to create security for multiple obligations pursuant to one pledge or mortgage agreement, in practice one pledge

<<<

 or mortgage agreement secures only one obligation (i.e., monetary obligations arising under one agreement) and the performance of any other obligation is secured by the pledge or mortgage of the same collateral by a lower ranking pledge or

<<<

 mortgage agreement. In any event the restrictions and limitations under Lithuanian laws with respect to enforceability of creditors' rights will apply. As a result, the
303

Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of so-called `

<<<

`parallel obligations." Pursuant to a parallel obligation, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to the amount payable by the Issuer under the Indenture and the Notes. The parallel obligation is not known in Lithuanian law and

<<<

 thus the parallel obligation procedure may be subject to uncertainties as to validity and enforceability in Lithuania and other jurisdictions in which it is used as a mechanism for securing obligations under the Notes. We cannot assure you

<<<

 that the parallel obligation procedure will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability posed by Lithuanian laws or the laws in other applicable jurisdictions.
Russia
Russian Insolvency Law
C om m en cem en t o f bankruptcy proceedings

<<<


As a general rule, a company is deemed to be insolvent if its debts are at least three months overdue. At the request of a creditor or authority, bankruptcy proceedings may be initiated if the overdue amount is not less than RUB 100,000 (approximately

<<<

 2,000) and is confirmed by a court or arbitration decision. In certain cases the company itself may, and sometimes is obliged to, file for its bankruptcy.
Stages
Russian insolvency legislation provides for four major stages of bankruptcy proceedings

<<<

, some of which are mandatory and some of which are optional.
Generally, bankruptcy proceedings start with the supervision stage. During the supervision stage, a temporary manager proposed by creditors and appointed by the court determines the

<<<

 amount of indebtedness, analyses the debtor's financial standing, receives creditors' applications and arranges the first creditors' meeting, at which creditors decide on the next stage(s) of bankruptcy. However, during the supervision stage

<<<

 management of the debtor remains in charge of its day-to-day operations, under the supervision of the temporary manager.
Upon commencement of the supervision stage, all obligations of the debtor, other than current claims (i.e., those which

<<<

 have arisen after the commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings), may only be settled through the bankruptcy proceedings, and all such obligations become immediately due and payable. Information on commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings

<<<

 is published in an official newspaper chosen based on public tender results (which has been Kommersant newspaper for the last several years) and is available on the Internet. All creditors must within 30 days after commencement of the supervision

<<<

 stage present their claims to the debtor. However, as a matter of Russian law, commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings in respect of a Russian Guarantor would allow the creditors thereof to enter into these proceedings if the payment under

<<<

 the secured obligations became due and remains unpaid. Generally, the duration of the supervision stage is 7 months.
Following the supervision stage, the court may, upon resolution of the creditors, rule on a proposed financial restructuring

<<<

 of the debtor. During the financial restructuring the existing management of the debtor continues day-to-day operations, under the control of the administrative manager. The aim of this stage is to protect the debtor from creditors, restore

<<<

 the debtor's solvency, and arrange for the repayment of the relevant debts in accordance with agreed payment schedule. Financial restructuring may last for up to two years and is rarely used, as it usually requires the provision of security

<<<

 by a third party to ensure the satisfaction of the creditors' claims.
Another pathway to restore the debtor's solvency is external management, which may last for up to 24 months. Upon commencement of such external management the powers of the

<<<

 debtor's management are terminated and the external manager obtains all management powers over the debtor. External management leads to a moratorium on the discharge of obligations of the debtor. An external manager has various powers which

<<<

 they may exercise in attempting to restore the solvency of the debtor, including powers to dispose of assets, terminate contracts, issue shares and replace or exchange assets.
If the solvency of the debtor cannot be restored the court will

<<<

 commence the bankruptcy management stage. A bankruptcy manager, who replaces the management of the debtor (if it remains), primarily focuses on identification of all creditors, restoration of the assets, further sale of the assets and discharge

<<<

 of the obligations in accordance with the priority of claims.
304

P riority o f claim s
Russian bankruptcy law specifies the order of priority in which the debtor's claims shall be discharged. All claims which became due before or on the

<<<

 commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings (``bankruptcy claims'') are discharged as follows:
 first-priority claims include those arising from the debtor's liabilities to individuals for harm to life or health, or for moral harm (as defined

<<<

 under Russian law);
 second-priority claims arise out of the debtor's obligation to pay wages, salary or other amounts under an employment agreement or to pay fees or royalties to authors;
 third-priority claims include all other claims,

<<<

 including taxes and duties. Claims secured by a pledge or mortgage over the debtor's assets are partially (70-80%) settled out of the proceeds from the sale of such assets ahead of all other claims, with the remaining part used to settle the

<<<

 first- and secondpriority claims.
In addition to bankruptcy claims, there are also current claims of the debtor, i.e., those which have arisen after the commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings. These claims have super-priority in relation

<<<

 to unsecured bankruptcy claims. Russian bankruptcy law prescribes various categories of current claims and the priority of such claims.
C h a lle n g in g d e b t o r 's tr a n s a c tio n s
The following transactions of a debtor may generally

<<<

 be challenged by an appointed manager, and, in some cases, by creditors:
 suspicious transactions, including transactions without fair consideration, where executed within one year prior to commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings;
 harmful

<<<

 transactions aimed at causing harm to or defeating the rights or interests of creditors, where executed up to three years prior to commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings; and
 preferential transactions that lead, or may lead, to preferential

<<<

 treatment of a particular creditor over other creditors, where executed within one or six months (depending on the type) prior to commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings.
Guarantees
U nilateral undertaking
Russian law and Russian courts

<<<

 are not familiar with the concept of a unilateral (i.e., one-sided) third-party corporate guarantee. At the same time, the Civil Code of the Russian Federation generally allows the existence of security instruments that are not explicitly envisaged

<<<

 by Russian law. Therefore, our Russian legal counsel believe that provision by a Russian Guarantor of the Note Guarantee in the form of a written unilateral undertaking to secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes does not per se

<<<

 violate Russian law.
Although Russian law is not unequivocal on the issue of choice of law for unilateral undertakings, we are aware of certain court precedents that recognize the choice of foreign law to govern unilateral bank guarantees issued

<<<

 by Russian guarantors. Russian courts may also uphold the choice of foreign law to govern the Note Guarantee, subject to the limitations described in ``--A p p lic a tio n o f fo reig n la w " below.
In the absence of any applicable Russian

<<<

 legislation, it is not possible to predict how Russian courts would enforce a unilateral Note Guarantee governed by foreign law against a Russian Guarantor, and the actual enforcement would largely depend on the proper representation of the

<<<

 creditor in the respective court proceedings.
R u ssian securities legislation
The Russian Securities Act sets forth specific regulations on issuing bonds secured by a suretyship, including a prohibition on providing a suretyship in an amount

<<<

 exceeding the surety's net assets. Although our Russian counsel believe that such requirements only apply to notes issued and registered in Russia, a Russian court may apply them to the Notes should they be admitted to circulation in Russia

<<<

 in accordance with the provisions of the Securities Act. The application of Russian law regulations to Notes not admitted to circulation in Russia, but purchased by a Russian investor, is currently unclear, and it is possible that a
305

Russian

<<<

 court may apply such regulations to the Notes even if they are not admitted to circulation in Russia.
S u bordination o f claim s
The concept of subordination of claims with respect to a guarantee or suretyship is foreign to Russian law. In

<<<

 the absence of developed court practice, it is difficult to predict whether a Russian court would enforce subordination provisions.
C hallenging the N o te G u arantee
Execution of the Note Guarantee requires obtaining corporate approvals in

<<<

 accordance with Russian corporate law, and it may require additional approvals in accordance with the Guarantor's internal documents and regulations. Failure to duly approve the Note Guarantee may give a shareholder of the Guarantor the right

<<<

 to challenge the Note Guarantee.
A pplication o f foreign law
As a matter of Russian law, if one of the parties to an agreement is a foreign person/entity or the relations are otherwise affected by a foreign element, the parties to that agreement

<<<

 may generally agree on the application of foreign law. The choice of foreign law, however, will not limit the application of certain mandatory provisions of Russian law if:  such provisions apply directly due to their nature or high importance

<<<

; or  such provisions apply due to public policy principle (o rd re p u b lic ); or  all material aspects of the relations between the parties are connected with Russia.
P ublic law s
The guarantee provided by the Russian Guarantor and the

<<<

 ability of the Russian Guarantor to perform its obligations thereunder is subject to the applicable public laws of the Russian Federation, including laws regulating bank operations, fighting corruption and terrorism, currency control laws,

<<<

 anti-money laundering laws and other laws of a similar nature.
R ussian m erger control
If enforcement of any security over the parent companies of a Russian Guarantor would lead to a change of control (either direct or indirect) over the Guarantor

<<<

, such change of control may require Russian merger control filing provided that the following thresholds are met:  the total balance sheet value of the assets of the new controlling company (and its group) and the
Russian Guarantor exceeds

<<<

 7 billion roubles, or  the total income of the new controlling company (and its group) and the Russian Guarantor derived
from the sale of goods during the last calendar year exceeds 10 billion roubles; and  the total balance sheet value of

<<<

 the assets of the Russian Guarantor (and its group in case of partial
change of control) exceeds 250 million roubles. The filing responsibility is on the new controlling company.

<<<

 agreement between the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers dated the date of this offering memorandum, the Issuer has agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers and the Initial Purchasers severally have agreed to purchase from the Issuer, all the

<<<

 Notes offered hereby. The purchase agreement provides that the Initial Purchasers are obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase all the Notes, if any are purchased. In the event that an Initial Purchaser fails or refuses to purchase

The Initial Purchasers are offering

<<<

 the Notes, subject to prior sale, when, as and if issued to and accepted by them, subject to approval of legal matters by their counsel, including the validity of the Notes, and other conditions contained in the purchase agreement, such as

<<<

 the receipt by the Initial Purchasers of officer's certificates and customary legal opinions. The Initial Purchasers reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to investors and to reject orders in whole or in part.
The Initial Purchasers

<<<

 have advised us that they propose to offer the Notes initially at the offering price listed on the cover page of this offering memorandum and may also offer the Notes to selling group members at the offering price less a selling concession

<<<

. After the initial offering, the offering price and other selling terms of the Notes may be varied at any time without notice. Sales of the Notes by the Initial Purchasers in the United States may be made through affiliates of the Initial Purchasers

<<<

 who are U.S. registered broker-dealers.
The Issuer has agreed to pay the Initial Purchasers certain customary fees for their services in connection with the Offering and to reimburse them for certain out-of-pocket expenses. The Issuer has also

<<<

 agreed to indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, or to contribute to payments the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect of those liabilities

Certain members of the Lender-Owner Syndicate are expected to purchase Notes in the Offering.
Notes are not Being Registered Under the U.S. Securities Act
The Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been registered under the U.S. Securities

<<<

 Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States or to U.S. persons unless the Notes and the Note Guarantees are registered under the U.S. Securities Act, or an exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act

<<<

 is available. Accordingly, each of the Initial Purchasers, severally and not jointly, has agreed that it will not offer or sell the Notes except (i) to "qualified institutional buyers'' (as defined in Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act

<<<

 (``Rule 144A")) ("QIBs") in reliance on Rule 144A and (ii) to persons other than ``U.S. persons'' (as defined in Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act (``Regulation 5")) outside the United States in offshore transactions (as defined in

<<<

 Regulation S) in reliance on Regulation S. Any offer or sale of Notes in the United States in reliance on Rule 144A will be made by broker-dealers who are registered as such under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended the ``U

<<<

.S. Exchange Act''). Because Nordea Bank Danmark A/S is not registered with the SEC as a U.S.-registered brokerdealer, it will effect offers and sales of the Notes solely outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S.
In addition, until

<<<

 the expiration of 40 days after the commencement of this Offering, an offer or sale of the Notes within the United States by a broker/dealer (whether or not participating in this offering) may violate the registration requirements of the U

<<<

.S. Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act or pursuant to another exemption from registration under the U.S. Securities Act. Resales of the Notes are restricted

(1) it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or instrument to engage in investment activity

<<<

 (within the meaning of Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 does not

 securities (having a term of more than one year) for a period of 90 days from the date the Notes are issued without first obtaining the written consent of the Initial Purchasers.
New Issue of Notes
The Notes are a new issue of securities with

<<<

 no established trading market. We will apply, through our listing agent, to have the Fixed Rate Notes and the Floating Rate Notes listed on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Global Exchange Market

<<<

 of this Offering. However, the Initial Purchasers are under no obligation to do so and may discontinue any market-making activities at any time without notice. In addition, any such market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed

<<<

 by the U.S. Securities Act and the U.S. Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, or that it will be liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time

 or at a price which will be favorable to you.
Price Stabilization and Short Positions
In connection with the offering, J.P. Morgan Securities plc (the ``Stabilizing Manager") (or persons acting on its behalf) may purchase and sell Notes in

<<<

 the open market. These transactions may include over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the Initial Purchasers

<<<

. Stabilizing transactions permit bids to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has

<<<

 been completed in order to cover short position. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker/dealer when the Notes originally sold by such broker/dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering

<<<

 transaction to cover short positions. These transactions may be effected in the over-the-counter market or otherwise.
These activities may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the Notes. As a result, the price of the

<<<

 Notes may be higher than the prices that otherwise might exist in the open market. Neither the Initial Purchasers nor the Issuer make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described

<<<

 above may have on the price of the Notes. In addition, there is no obligation on the Stabilizing Manager to engage in such transactions and neither the Initial Purchasers nor the Issuer make any representation that the Stabilizing Manager will

<<<

 engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice. Any stabilizing action, if commenced, must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the Issue Date and 60 days after the

<<<

 date of the allotment of the Notes.
Initial Settlement
It is expected that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the date specified in the last paragraph of the cover page of this offering memorandum, which

<<<

 will be the third business day following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle being referred to as "T+3").

Other Relationships The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates have engaged in, and may in the future

<<<

 engage in, investment banking and other commercial dealings in the ordinary course of business with us and our affiliates. They have received, and expect to receive, customary fees and commissions for these transactions. Each of ING Bank N

<<<

.V, an affiliate of ING Bank N.V, London Branch, Danske Bank Oyj, an affiliate of Danske Bank A/S and Nordea Bank Finland Plc, an affiliate of Nordea Bank Danmark A/S, is a member of the Lender-Owner Syndicate and also a lender and/or agent

, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments

<<<

 (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of ours or our affiliates. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their

<<<

 affiliates that have a lending relationship with us routinely hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering

<<<

 into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading

<<<

 prices of the Notes offered hereby. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold

<<<

, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

 the Notes, notice of any restrictions on the transfer of such Notes;
(8) it acknowledges that until the expiration of 40 days after the commencement of the Offering, any offer or sale of the Notes within the United States by a broker/dealer

 that would result in a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this offering memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for such purpose is required.

 Consequently, any transfer of the Notes will be subject to the selling restrictions set out under the caption "Plan of Distribution.''
312

SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES
The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of

<<<

 Finland and the Guarantors are organized under the laws of Finland, Sweden, Poland, Lithuania and Russia. All the directors and the executive officers of the Issuer, and all the managers of the Guarantors are non-residents of the United States

<<<

. Although the Issuer and the Guarantors have submitted to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on the directors

<<<

 and the executive officers of the Issuer and the Guarantors. It may also not be possible for investors to effect service of process within Finland, Sweden, Poland, Lithuania or Russia upon the Issuer, the Guarantors or those persons under the

<<<

 Convention on Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 and the law of Finland, Sweden, Poland, Lithuania or Russia, respectively, implementing such convention if such service

<<<

 were deemed to infringe the sovereignty or security of Finland, Sweden, Poland, Lithuania or Russia, respectively, which may especially be the case if such service violated the substantial foundations of the law of Finland, Sweden, Poland,

<<<

 Lithuania or Russia, respectively. In addition, as the majority of the Issuer's and the Guarantors' assets and the majority of the assets of our and their directors are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce against

<<<

 them or us judgments obtained in the U.S. courts predicated on civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States.
If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against the Issuer or the Guarantors or a non-guarantor

<<<

 security provider, investors will need to enforce such judgment in jurisdictions where the relevant company has assets. You should consult with your own advisors in any pertinent jurisdictions as needed to enforce a judgment in those countries

<<<

 or elsewhere outside the United States.
Finland
We have been advised by our Finnish legal counsel that there is no treaty on the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters

<<<

 between the United States and Finland. Courts in Finland will not automatically recognize and enforce a final judgment rendered by a U.S. court. Under Finnish law, a Finnish title for execution (i.e., a Finnish court judgment) is required for

<<<

 such recognition and enforcement; in seeking a Finnish court judgment or order to such effect, a judgment of a U.S. court will constitute circumstantial evidence of the questions of fact in the case concerned and evidence of the governing law

<<<

 as applied to the matter in dispute. The application by a Finnish court of foreign law in a matter brought before it is subject to (a) the foreign law not being contrary to such mandatory rules of Finnish law that due to their public nature

<<<

 or general interest would be considered applicable irrespective of the agreed choice of law; and (b) the application of the foreign law not resulting in an outcome contrary to the public policy (ordre public) of the Finnish legal system.
As

<<<

 to types of damages awarded, punitive or exemplary damages are unenforceable under Finnish law and a Finnish court may only award damages to the extent that they form compensation for actual losses and damages as proven by the claimant. A feature

<<<

 of the Finnish civil procedure is that the burden of proof with respect to any claims presented lies with the claimant. A party to legal proceedings in Finland is also ordinarily expected to plead its case primarily on the basis of the evidence

<<<

 in its own possession. U.S. notions of discovery, including the expectation that broadly defined categories of documents and information in the possession of third parties will be readily accessible for use as evidence, are not recognized under

<<<

 Finnish law. The availability of documentation in the possession of counterparties or third parties is very limited. Depositions are also a form of taking evidence unknown to Finnish law. In Finland, witness testimony is usually only taken

<<<

 at a separate oral main hearing (comparable to a U.S. trial) after the preparatory phase of the proceedings.
Sweden
We have been advised by our Swedish legal counsel that pursuant to the provisions of the Council Regulation (EC) No. 44/200

<<<

1 of December 22, 2000 on jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, as amended (the ``Brussels I Regulation") and the 2007 Lugano Convention on the Recognition of Judgments in Civil and Commercial

<<<

 Matters (the "Lugano Convention"), a judgment entered against a company in the courts of a Member State (as defined therein, i.e., all Member States of the EU) or Contracting State (as defined in the Lugano Convention) and which is enforceable

<<<

 in such a Member State or such a Contracting State will be directly enforceable in Sweden only upon the satisfaction of the following requirements: (a) that a motion for enforcement has been filed with and granted by the Svea Court of Appeal

<<<

 in Stockholm as provided by law and has been granted and
313

(b) that the formal requirements in the Brussels I Regulation or Lugano Convention have been fulfilled. However, upon challenge of the decision on enforceability, the Svea Court

<<<

 of Appeal may under certain circumstances stay the proceedings.
Judgments entered against any Swedish party in the courts of a state which is not a member state under the terms of the Brussels I Regulation or a contracting state under the terms

<<<

 of the Lugano Convention (e.g., the United States) would not be recognized or enforceable in Sweden as a matter of law without retrial on the merits (but will be of persuasive authority as a matter of evidence before the courts of law, administrative

<<<

 tribunals or executive or other public authorities of Sweden). However, there is Swedish case law to indicate that such judgments:
 that are based on a contract which expressly excludes the jurisdiction of the courts of Sweden;
 that were

<<<

 rendered under observance of due process of law;
 against which there lies no further right to appeal; and
 the recognition of which would not manifestly contravene fundamental principles of the legal order or the public policy of Sweden

<<<

,
ought to be examined by the appropriate Swedish district court following which such court may hand down a new judgment, based on the foreign judgment, without retrial on the merits of the dispute although the court will be free to do so at

<<<

 its discretion. The exact scope of this principle has yet to be determined.
Poland
We have been advised by our Polish counsel that enforcement of judgments of foreign courts is subject to the 1988 Lugano Convention on the Recognition of Judgments

<<<

 in Civil and Commercial Matters, the Council Regulation (EC) No. 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, and other relevant treaties or conventions, including relevant

<<<

 bilateral treaties and the rules of the Polish Code of Civil Procedure.
There is no treaty between the United States and Poland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) rendered in

<<<

 civil and commercial matters. Therefore, to judgments of U.S. courts, the rules of the Polish Code of Civil Procedure shall apply. Those rules provide for enforcement of foreign judgments concerning matters which may be settled by Polish civil

<<<

 courts if the judgment is enforceable in the country where it has been rendered. In addition, the following requirements must be satisfied:
 the judgment is final in the jurisdiction in which it was issued;
 the case does not belong to the

<<<

 exclusive jurisdiction of the Polish courts;
 no summons has been served on the defendant, who was not engaged in the dispute on the matter, in due time for his defense;
 the party has not been deprived of the possibility of defending itself

<<<

 in judicial proceedings;
 a case regarding the same claim between the same parties was not pending in Poland (before a court or other authority) earlier than before a court of the foreign country;
 the judgment is not contrary to an earlier

<<<

 final judgment of a Polish court (or other competent authority) or an earlier final judgment of a foreign court (or other competent authority) satisfying the conditions for its recognition in Poland, which was rendered in a case regarding the

<<<

 same claim between the same parties; and
 the judgment is not contrary to the fundamental principles of the legal order of Poland.
Lithuania
We have been advised by our Lithuanian legal counsel that pursuant to the provisions of the Council

<<<

 Regulation (EC) No. 44/2001 of December 22, 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, as amended (the "Brussels Regulation") and 2007 Lugano Convention on jurisdiction and the recognition

<<<

 and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, a judgment entered against a company in the courts of a Member State (as defined therein, i.e., all Member States of the EU) or against a Contracting State (as defined in the Lugano

<<<

 Convention) and which is enforceable in such a Member State or Contracting State shall be enforced in another Member
314

State or Contracting State when, on the application of any interested party, it has been declared enforceable there.

<<<

 The judgment shall be declared enforceable immediately on completion of the formalities described in the Brussels Regulation or the Lugano Convention without re-examination of the merits of the case, and the party against whom enforcement is

<<<

 sought shall not at this stage of the proceedings be entitled to make any submissions on the application. However, in case the decision on the application for a declaration of enforceability is appealed against by either party, the court with

<<<

 which an appeal is lodged shall refuse or revoke a declaration of enforceability only on one of the following grounds:
 if such recognition is manifestly contrary to public policy in the State in which recognition is sought;
 where it was

<<<

 given in default of appearance, if the defendant was not served with the document which instituted the proceedings or with an equivalent document in sufficient time and in such a way as to enable him to arrange for his defense, unless the defendant

<<<

 failed to commence proceedings to challenge the judgment when it was possible for him to do so;
 if it is irreconcilable with a judgment given in a dispute between the same parties in the State in which recognition is sought;
 if it is irreconcilable

<<<

 with an earlier judgment given in another State involving the same cause of action and between the same parties, provided that the earlier judgment fulfils the conditions necessary for its recognition in the State addressed;
 if the matter

<<<

 is one within the exclusive jurisdiction of courts of another State pursuant to Brussels Regulation (or Lugano Convention).
There is no treaty between the United States and Lithuania providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement

<<<

 of judgments (other than arbitration awards) rendered in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, to judgments of U.S. courts, the rules of the Lithuanian Code of Civil Procedure shall apply (IX-743, Civilinio proceso kodeksas). Those rules

<<<

 provide for enforcement of foreign judgments. The enforcement must be achieved in Lithuanian Court of Appeal. The enforcement may not be granted if:
 the judgment has not come into force in the jurisdiction in which it was adopted;
 pursuant

<<<

 to the Lithuanian laws or provisions of the international treaties, the case falls under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Lithuanian courts or third-country courts;
 the party, absent from the proceedings, had not been duly informed about

<<<

 the proceedings and was not afforded due procedural defense during the proceedings;
 the judgment is inconsistent with a judgment passed by the court of Lithuania with regards to the claim between the same parties; and
 the judgment contradicts

<<<

 to the public policy established by the Constitution of Lithuania.
 the court of the foreign country has decided on legal capacity, representation under the law, family property relations or inheritance in respect of Lithuanian citizen if

<<<

 the decision is contrary to Lithuanian private international law, except if Lithuanian court would have adopted a similar decision.
Russia
We have been advised by our Russian counsel that Russian courts will generally recognize the mutual agreement

<<<

 of parties on the choice of a foreign court as an appropriate forum. However, Russian state commercial (``arbitrazhny") courts will generally not allow the initiation of legal proceedings in Russia if proceedings including the same dispute

<<<

 between the same parties have been commenced in a foreign court. By contrast, Russian courts of general jurisdiction (which decide cases involving physical persons and not related to entrepreneurial activities) will refuse to initiate proceedings

<<<

 in Russia only if the decision of a foreign court may be enforced in Russia or there is a treaty on recognition of foreign court decisions. Moreover, Russian courts (both commercial courts and courts of general jurisdiction) will allow parallel

<<<

 legal proceedings in Russia if the matter falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of Russian courts, such as cases concerning the title to real estate located in Russia, intellectual property rights registered in Russia, or the establishment

<<<

, registration and liquidation of Russian legal entities or decisions of their management bodies.
There is no treaty between the United States and the Russian Federation on the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than

<<<

 arbitral awards) in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, Russian
315

courts are not obliged to recognize and enforce a final judgment rendered by a U.S. court. Russian courts may do so at their discretion on the basis of the principles

<<<

 of international comity and reciprocity. However, there are no guarantees that a final judgment rendered by a U.S. court will be recognized and enforced in Russia. Moreover, Russian courts will not enforce in Russia any judgment of a foreign

<<<

 court if:  the judgment has not entered into force;  process was not timely and duly served on the party against whom the judgment is rendered, or that
party was otherwise deprived of the right to present its case to the foreign court; 

<<<

 the case falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of Russian courts;  there is a judgment of a Russian court that has entered into force and that concerns the same claim
between the same parties, or proceedings involving the same dispute between

<<<

 the same parties have been commenced before a Russian court prior to the commencement of the relevant proceedings before the foreign court;  the term for enforcement of the judgment of the foreign court has lapsed; or  the enforcement of

<<<

 the judgment is contrary to the public order (ordre public) of the Russian Federation (including if enforcement would lead to breach of good faith, equality of the parties and adequacy of the liability), or, in certain cases may affect its

<<<

 sovereignty and security.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
1. General information
Paroc Group Oy (the "Parent company" or the "Company") is a Finnish limited liability company organized

<<<

 on December 11, 2009 under the laws of Finland. The parent company and its subsidiaries together form Paroc Group (the "Group" or "Paroc"). The domicile and address of the Company's registered office is Energiakuja 3, 00180 Helsinki, Finland

<<<

. The ultimate parent of the Group is Safari Luxco 1 S.A., which is incorporated in Luxembourg.
Operations of the Group started on December 23, 2009, when the Parent company acquired Paroc Sverige AB and its subsidiaries from Paroc Group Holding

<<<

 Oy. The production of stone wool started in Sweden in 1937 and in Finland in 1952. Paroc name and trade mark was registered for the first time in 1982. Today Paroc is one of the major manufacturers of mineral wool insulation products in Europe

<<<

. Its products include building insulation, technical insulation and marine insulation, as well as building elements and acoustics products. The Group has manufacturing plants in Finland, Sweden, Lithuania and Poland, and sales offices and representatives

<<<

 in 13 European countries.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The financial statements of Paroc have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards and IFRIC Interpretations as

<<<

 adopted by the EU as of December 31, 2013. The consolidated financial statements are presented in thousands of Euros and have been prepared under the historical cost convention unless otherwise stated in the accounting principles.
Paroc has

<<<

 applied revised IAS 1 Presentation of the Financial Statements and has grouped items presented in other comprehensive income on the basis of whether they may be subsequently reclassified to profit or loss.
Paroc has disclosed the offsetting

<<<

 of financial assets and financial liabilities in accordance with IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
The following standards have also been adopted January 1, 2013
 IAS 19 Employee benefits (amendment). All actuarial gains and losses

<<<

 are immediately recognized in other comprehensive income and the corridor approach has been waived. Finance costs are calculated on a net funding basis (see note 23 to these consolidated financial statements).
 IFRS 13 Fair value measurement

<<<

. The standard aims to improve consistency in fair value measurement and provide new disclosure requirements when such measurements are required or permitted by other IFRSs. These consolidated financial statements include the disclosures applicable

<<<

 to the Group under IFRS 13. Changes in these accounting standards during the financial year did not have a material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.
These consolidated financial statements comprising of the consolidated

<<<

 statements of income, consolidated statements of comprehensive income, consolidated statements of cash flows and consolidated statements of changes in shareholders' equity for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 and consolidated

<<<

 statements of financial position as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 and the related notes have been prepared solely for the purpose of inclusion in this Offering Memorandum in connection with the issue of notes by Paroc Group Oy and cannot be

<<<

 used for any other purpose. Considering the special purpose of the consolidated financial statements, no Board of Directors' report and parent company standalone figures have been included in the financial information presented herein. These

<<<

 consolidated financial statements are not the statutory financial statements of the Group.
These consolidated financial statements have been authorized for issue by the Board of Directors of Paroc Group Oy on 28 April, 2014.
Standards, amendments

<<<

 and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective
The IASB has published the following new or amended standards and interpretations, which are not yet effective and have not yet been adopted by the Group in its financial

<<<

 statements. The Group will adopt
F-9

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
2. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)
each standard and interpretation from their effective date, or if the effective date

<<<

 is different from the first date of the reporting period, from the start of the next reporting period following the effective date.
The Group will adopt the following standards and interpretations in January 1, 2014 or later as applicable:

<<<


 Amendment to IFRSs 10, 11 and 12 on transition guidance. Amendments provide additional relief limiting the requirement to provide adjusted comparative information to only the preceding comparative period. The effective date within EU is January

<<<

 1, 2014.
 IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements. The objectives are to establish principles for the presentation and preparation of consolidated financial statements. The effective date within EU is January 1, 2014.
 IFRS 11 Joint arrangements

<<<

. The standard is focusing on the rights and obligations of the joint arrangement rather than its legal form. The effective date within EU is January 1, 2014.
 IFRS 12 Disclosures of interests in other entities. The standard includes the disclosure

<<<

 requirements for all forms of interests in other entities. The effective date within EU is January 1, 2014.
 IAS 27 Separate financial statements (revised 2011). The revised standard includes the provisions on separate financial statements

<<<

 that are left after the control provisions of IAS 27 have been included in the new IFRS 10. The effective date within EU is January 1, 2014.
 IAS 28 Associates and joint ventures (revised 2011). The revised standard includes the requirements

<<<

 for joint ventures and associates to be equity accounted following the issue of IFRS 11. The effective date within EU is January 1, 2014.
 IAS 32 Financial instruments: Presentation (amendment). The amendment clarifies asset and liability

<<<

 offsetting. The effective date is January 1, 2014.
 Amendments to IFRS 10, 12 and IAS 27 on consolidation for investment entities. The effective date is January 1, 2014.
 IAS 36 Impairment of assets (amendment). This amendment addresses the

<<<

 disclosure of information about the recoverable amount of impaired assets if that amount is based on fair value less costs of disposal. The effective date is January 1, 2014.
 IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement (amendment

<<<

). This amendment provides relief from discontinuing hedge accounting when novation of a hedging instrument to a central counterparty meets specified criteria. The effective date is January 1, 2014.
 IFRIC 21 Levies. This interpretation of

<<<

 IAS 37 provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets sets out criteria for the recognition of liability, one of which is the requirement for the entity to have a present obligation as a result of a past event. The effective date

<<<

 is January 1, 2014. The standard has not yet been endorsed by the EU.
 IFRS 9 Financial instruments. The standard retains but simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes two primary measurement categories for financial assets: amortized

<<<

 cost and fair value. The effective date is undefined. The standard has not yet been endorsed by the EU.
 IAS 19 Defined benefit plans: Employee contributions (amendment). The amendment allows contributions that are linked to service, and do

<<<

 not vary with the length of employee service, to be deducted from the cost of benefits earned in the period that the service is provided. The effective date is 1 July 2014. The standard has not yet been endorsed by the EU.
 Annual improvements

<<<

 2012 - 2012 reporting cycle include changes to IFRS 2 Share-based payments, IFRS 3 Business combinations, IFRS 8 Operating segments, IFRS 13 Fair value measurement, IAS 16 Property, plant and equipment, IAS 38 Intangible assets and IAS 24 Related

<<<

 party disclosures. The effective date is July 1, 2014. The standard has not yet been endorsed by the EU.
F-10

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
2. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)  Annual improvements

<<<

 2011 - 2013 reporting cycle include changes to IFRS 3 Business combinations,
IFRS 13 Fair value measurement and IAS 40 Investment property. The effective date is July 1, 2014. The standard has not yet been endorsed by the EU. The above mentioned

<<<

 amendments to the standards and interpretations are estimated to have an impact mainly on the disclosures for the Group.
Critical accounting estimates and judgments The preparation of financial statements requires estimates and assumptions

<<<

 regarding the future in which results may differ from the estimates and assumptions made. In addition to this, applying the accounting policies requires management judgment. Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on

<<<

 historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Uncertainty related to critical accounting estimates The group makes estimates and assumptions concerning

<<<

 the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities

<<<

 within the next financial year are addressed below.
Estimated impairment testing The Group tests goodwill, intangible assets not yet available for use and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually. In addition to this

<<<

, impairment indicators are assessed at each reporting date as described in the accounting policies. The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units are determined based on value in use calculations. The Group's business is managed on a

<<<

 matrix basis and as such, cash generating units for goodwill impairment testing purposes have been determined on a geographical basis, however, impairment calculations have been prepared also on a business area basis, which is the primary basis

<<<

 for managing the business. Preparation of these calculations requires the use of estimates, which are further described in Note 12. The pre-tax cash flow projections are based on budgeted amounts and strategy forecasts approved by the Board

<<<

 of Directors. Cash flows beyond the three-year projection period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rate of 2% (2012: 2%). The discount rate used in the impairment testing is the pre-tax weighted average cost of capital ("WACC"), which

<<<

 consist of the peer group unlevered beta and risk free rate per country targeted debt to equity ratio. Additional information on sensitivity of the recoverable amount to changes in assumptions used is presented in the note 12 Intangible assets

<<<

.
Income taxes The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax

<<<

 determination is uncertain. Management judgment is required for the calculation of the provision for income taxes and deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Group reviews at each balance sheet date the carrying amount of deferred tax assets

<<<

. The Group considers whether it is probable that the group entities will have sufficient taxable profits against which the unused tax losses or unused tax credits can be utilized. The factors used in estimates may differ from actual outcome

<<<

 which could lead to significant adjustments to deferred tax assets expensed in the statement of income. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the

<<<

 current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the period in which such determination is made.
F-11

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
2. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)
Employee benefits

<<<


The Group operates a mixture of pension and other post-employment benefit schemes. The present value of the pension obligations depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions. The assumptions

<<<

 used in determining the net cost (income) for pensions include the discount rate and changes in future compensation. The Group determines the appropriate discount rate at the end of each year. This is the interest rate that should be used to

<<<

 determine the present value of estimated future cash outflows expected to be required to settle the pension obligations. In determining the appropriate discount rate, the Group considers the interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that

<<<

 are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension obligation.
Statistical information used may differ materially from actual results due to changing

<<<

 market and economic conditions, changes in service period of plan participants or changes in other factors. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity

<<<

 in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. Significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the future amounts of the defined benefit obligation and future expense

<<<

.
Other key assumptions for pension obligations are based in part on current market conditions. Additional information is disclosed in note 23.
Summary of significant accounting policies
Consolidation principles
The consolidated financial statements

<<<

 include the parent company Paroc Group Oy and all subsidiaries where over 50% of the subsidiary's voting rights are controlled directly or indirectly by the parent company, or the parent company otherwise has control over the entity.
The acquisition

<<<

 method is applied to business combinations. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is determined as the fair values of the assets transferred and liabilities incurred. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred

<<<

. Acquired subsidiaries are accounted for using the acquisition method, according to which the assets and liabilities of the acquired company are measured at fair value as of the acquisition date.
Goodwill is the excess of the cost of the business

<<<

 combination over the acquirer's interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. Subsidiaries acquired during the financial year are included in the financial statements from the date of their

<<<

 acquisition and disposed subsidiaries are included up to their date of sale.
All internal transactions, receivables and liabilities, distribution of profit and unrealized profits are eliminated at consolidation.
Foreign subsidiaries
The consolidated

<<<

 financial statements are presented in Euros which is the functional and presentation currency of the parent company. Items of each subsidiary included in the consolidated financial statements are measured using the currency of the primary economic

<<<

 environment in which the entity operates ("the functional currency''). In the consolidated financial statements the statements of income of the foreign subsidiaries are translated at average exchange rates and statements of financial position

<<<

 at the closing rate as of the date of that statement of financial position. Translating the profit for the year and the total comprehensive income for the year using different exchange rates causes translation differences. This change is presented

<<<

 in other comprehensive income. Correspondingly, the translation differences arising from the equity of the foreign subsidiaries are recorded under equity and presented in other comprehensive income. In addition, cumulative translation adjustment

<<<

 includes the exchange gains and losses on monetary items (foreign currency denominated receivables from subsidiaries) that qualify for the classification as a part of the net investment in the foreign operation. When a consolidated foreign

<<<


F-12

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
2. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued) subsidiary is sold, the cumulative translation differences relating to that subsidiary recorded in equity are recognized

<<<

 in the statement of income as part of gain or loss on the sale.
Foreign currency transactions The Group companies' foreign currency transactions are translated into functional currencies using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the

<<<

 transactions. Foreign exchange differences relating to ordinary business operations are presented above operating profit in translation differences related to sales and purchases. Receivables and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies

<<<

 outstanding on the reporting date are translated using the exchange rates quoted on the reporting date. Translation differences relating to finance are presented in finance income and cost.
Revenue recognition The Group's revenues comprise

<<<

 of the fair value of consideration received from the sale of goods and services deducted by the sales related indirect taxes, estimated customer bonuses, discounts and other similar refunds.
Sales of goods The products sold by the Group are

<<<

 building insulation, technical insulation, marine insulation, building elements and acoustic products. The main source of revenue is building material sales. Revenue from building material sales is recognized when all of the following criteria

<<<

 have been satisfied; (1) The Group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods; (2) The Group retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with
ownership nor

<<<

 effective control over the goods sold; (3) The amount of revenue can be measured reliably; (4) It is probable the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity; and (5) The costs incurred or to be incurred with respect

<<<

 to the transaction can be measured reliably. Revenue is recognized based on sales contract prices deducted by estimated discounts at the time of sale. Estimating and recognizing discounts are based on previous experience. The time of payment

<<<

 granted for the goods sold is according to market practice and thus the sales include no financing arrangement.
Sales of services Revenues from sale of services are recognized once the service has been rendered.
Current and deferred income

<<<

 taxes The deferred tax liabilities and assets of the Group have, to a major part, been generated in connection with the formation of Paroc Group in December 2009. The income taxes related to the current period earnings, adjustments to previous

<<<

 period taxes and changes in deferred tax are recognized in the consolidated statement of income. Tax is recognized in the consolidated statement of income, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized in other comprehensive income

<<<

 or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively. Current tax related to the taxable profit for the period is calculated using the tax laws that have been enacted

<<<

 or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period in the countries where the subsidiaries of the parent company operate and accrue taxable income. Management reviews the decisions made in the tax returns regularly in situations where

<<<

 the applicable tax laws leave room for interpretations. When necessary, provisions are recognized for the amounts expected to be paid to tax authorities.
F-13

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

2. Summary of significant

<<<

 accounting policies (Continued)
Deferred income tax is recognized, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements

<<<

. However, the deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable

<<<

 profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realized or the deferred

<<<

 income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilized.
Deferred income tax is recognized

<<<

 for the temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not

<<<

 reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities, and when the deferred income taxes assets and liabilities

<<<

 relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.

Intangible assets
Intangible assets are recognized at

<<<

 the original acquisition cost. Intangible rights including quarry rights acquired in a business combination are recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Those intangible assets with definite useful lives are carried at cost less accumulated

<<<

 amortization and impairment losses. Amortization periods are based on the estimated useful lives as follows:

Development costs................................................................................................................

<<<

. P a t e n t s ................................................................................................................................... Computer software...........................................................................

<<<

...................................... Customer relationships.......................................................................................................... Quarry rights...........................................................

<<<

............................................................... Technology related Intangible rig h ts...................................................................................

0 - 5 years up to 20 years 0 - 5 years 20 years 17 - 

<<<

82 years 15 years

Goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite useful lives, like the brand Paroc, are not amortized but tested for impairment annually.

Goodwill
Goodwill arising from an acquisition represents the excess of the consideration

<<<

 transferred over the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and contingent liabilities recognized. Goodwill is recognized at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses

<<<

. Goodwill is not amortized but tested for impairment annually.
Cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of

<<<

 a cash generating unit may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, measured as value in use. The impairment loss is first allocated to reduce

<<<

 the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to the cash generating unit, and then to the other assets of the unit on pro rata basis. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed in any circumstances.

Research and development costs
All research

<<<

 costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs are also expensed as incurred unless all of the following six criteria are met:1
(1) there is technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or

<<<

 sale

F-14

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
2. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued) (2) there is intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it (3) there is ability to use the intangible

<<<

 asset or to sell it (4) intangible asset will generate future income (5) adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development are available (6) the cost can be measured reliably. After all the criteria are met, the

<<<

 development costs are recognized
as an asset and amortized as mentioned above.
Computer Software Acquisition costs of new software clearly associated with an identifiable and unique product, which will be controlled by the Group and generates

<<<

 probable future economic benefits, are recognized as an intangible asset and depreciated over the software's expected useful life. Associated costs include staff costs of the implementation team and an appropriate portion of overhead, but exclude

<<<

 the cost of maintaining the software, which is expensed as incurred. Website costs are expensed as incurred.
Emission allowances Acquired CO2 rights are capitalized under intangible assets at cost. CO2 rights received free of charge are recognized

<<<

 at zero value. A provision is recognized to cover the obligation to return emission allowances when the CO2 rights received free of charge are not enough to cover the actual amount of emissions. The provision is measured at its expected value

<<<

, which is the market value of those emission rights needed to meet the return obligation at the reporting date or the contractual price if the emission rights are based on a contract or they have been otherwise agreed on.
Property, plant and

<<<

 equipment Property, plant and equipment, include among others buildings and infrastructure, machinery and equipment used in the production and vehicles, are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment

<<<

 losses Acquisition cost includes all costs necessary to bring the asset to working condition for its intended use. This includes the asset's original purchase price, costs of site preparation, delivery and handling, installation, related professional

<<<

 fees for architects and engineers, and in case the entity incurs an obligation to dismantle and remove the asset and restore the site on which it is located, the estimated cost of meeting this obligation. General and specific borrowing costs

<<<

 directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets

<<<

, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is calculated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives. Land is not depreciated, with the exception

<<<

 of asphalting and other infrastructure costs.

The useful lives are reviewed at the end of

<<<

 each reporting period and, if they differ significantly from previous estimates, the depreciation periods are adjusted accordingly.

Depreciation begins when the asset is available for use (i.e. when it is in the location and condition necessary

<<<

 for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management) and continues until the asset is fully depreciated or derecognized.

An asset is removed from the balance sheet on disposal or when it is withdrawn from use and no future

<<<

 economic benefits are expected from it. The gain or loss on disposal is the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount, and is recognized in the statement of income in other operating income and expenses. Gains are

<<<

 classified as other operating income.

Government grants
Government Grants are recognized at their fair value where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and the Group will comply with all conditions attached.
Government

<<<

 grants relating to the purchase of property, plant and equipment are deducted from the acquisition cost of the asset. The depreciation is calculated based on the adjusted carrying value of the asset. Thus government grants are recognized as

<<<

 income during the assets useful life in the form of reduced depreciation charges.
Other government grants are recognized on a systematic basis as income over the periods necessary to match them with the costs for which they are intended to

<<<

 compensate. Government grants that are receivable as compensation for expenses or losses already incurred, or for the purpose of giving immediate financial support to the Group with no future related costs, are recognized in profit or loss

<<<

 in the period in which they become receivable.

Impairment of intangible and tangible assets
At the end of each reporting period the Group assesses, whether there are any indications that an asset is impaired. If any such indication exists

<<<

, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the asset. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually, irrespective as to whether there are any indications of impairment. In addition to this

<<<

, an impairment test is performed whenever there are indicators of impairment. For impairment testing purposes, goodwill is allocated to cash generating units based on the reporting structure applied in monitoring the Group's business.
The recoverable

<<<

 amount of a cash generating unit is the higher of its fair value less cost to sell or value in use. Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the cash-generating unit. The discount rate used in determining

<<<

 the present value of the cash flows is a pre-tax rate reflecting the current market assessment of the time value of money and asset specific risks.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
2. Summary of significant

<<<

 accounting policies (Continued)
An impairment loss is recognized in the consolidated statement of income, if the carrying amount of the asset or cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed if the recoverable

<<<

 amount of the asset is increased. However, the reversal of the impairment loss shall not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years. Impairment losses on goodwill

<<<

 are not reversed.
Leases
Group as lessee
A lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership. A lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not transfer substantially

<<<

 all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership.
Finance leases are recognized as assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position at amounts equal to the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, the present value of the

<<<

 minimum lease payments. Initial direct costs identified as directly attributable to activities performed by an entity for a finance lease are added to the amount recognized as an asset.
The discount rate used in calculating the present value

<<<

 of the minimum lease payments is the interest rate implicit in the lease. For finance leases, minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance charge is allocated

<<<

 to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Assets held under a finance lease are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the

<<<

 term of the lease.
Lease payments under an operating lease are recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Financial assets
The group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: at fair value through

<<<

 profit or loss, loans and receivables, and available-for-sale. The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.

<<<


Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading. A financial asset is classified in this category principally for the purpose of selling it in the short term. Derivatives are also included in this

<<<

 category unless they are designated as hedging instruments that qualify for hedge accounting.
Loans and receivables consist mainly of trade receivables and they are measured at amortized cost less provision for impairment. All outstanding trade

<<<

 receivables past due over 60 days are assessed separately. Impairment for trade receivables is also recognized when there is other evidence of insolvency, bankruptcy or liquidation of the debtor.
The Group's available-for-sale financial assets

<<<

 consist of investments in unquoted shares. These shares have been measured at cost, because their fair values cannot be measured reliably. Dividends received are presented as part of finance income. An impairment of financial assets available

<<<

-for-sale is recognized if there is objective evidence of impairment.
Financial assets are classified as current assets if expected to be settled within 12 months, otherwise they are classified as non-current.
Financial assets and liabilities

<<<

 are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously

<<<

.
Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
F-17

Notes to the Consolidated

<<<

 Financial Statements (Continued)
2. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued) Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are initially and subsequently recognized at fair value in the statement of financial

<<<

 position. Derivatives are designated as hedges of the fair value of recognized assets and liabilities (fair value hedges), hedges of forecast transactions or firm commitments (cash flow hedges) or hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation

<<<

 (net investment hedge). The Group has only applied cash flow hedge accounting in the consolidated financial statements. At the contract date the derivatives are classified as hedging instruments for cash flow hedge accounting purposes. The

<<<

 interest rate differential component of foreign exchange forwards is immediately recognized in the statement of income. The effective portion of the change in the fair value of the currency component is recognized in other comprehensive income

<<<

 in the fair value reserve and the ineffective portion is adjusted to sales or purchases. When the underlying forecasted sale or purchase occurs the cumulative changes of fair value are transferred into the statement of income to adjust sales

<<<

 or purchases. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss recorded in equity under other comprehensive income at that time remains in equity and

<<<

 is recognized in the statement of income when the forecasted transaction occurs. If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss reported in other comprehensive income is immediately transferred to

<<<

 the statement of income. Hedging effectiveness testing is carried out at least every quarter. The Group applies cash flow hedge accounting for hedging its interest rate risk using interest rate derivatives. The changes in the fair values of

<<<

 the hedging instruments are recorded through the fair value reserve. The cash flow hedge accounting impact from interest rate swaps is recognized gross under finance income and costs.
Inventories Inventories are measured at lower of cost or

<<<

 net realizable value. Costs are assigned to inventories by the method most appropriate to the particular class of inventory, with purchased inventories being valued on a first-in-first-out (FIFO) basis and manufactured inventories being technically

<<<

 valued at the standard costs, reflecting the FIFO basis, comprising direct costs and a systematic appropriate allocation of indirect costs related to fixed and variable manufacturing overheads. Raw material costs include transportation, load

<<<

 handling and other costs incurred in conjunction with the supply of stone from Paroc's own and concession quarries. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion

<<<

 and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. An allowance for obsolete products and spare parts is recorded as expense in the period during which the obsolescence has been noted based on technical aging or other factors.
Cash and cash

<<<

 equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash at hand, bank deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity. The Group does

<<<

 not have any treasury shares. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are presented as a deduction of equity.
Trade payables Trade payables are obligations to pay for the goods and services that have been acquired

<<<

 in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Accounts payables are classified as current liabilities if the payment is due within one year or less. Otherwise they are presented as non-current liabilities.
F-18

Notes to the Consolidated

 Financial Statements (Continued)
2. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued) Trade payables are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.
Borrowings
Borrowings

<<<

 are recognized in the statement of financial position in current or non-current liabilities initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Subsequently the financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost. Interest and transaction

<<<

 costs included in effective interest are allocated to the consolidated statement of income using the effective interest method over the expected loan maturity.
Share-based investment plan A part of the Paroc Group's key persons are involved

<<<

 in Safari Luxco 1 S.A. Group's share-based investment plan. The plan has been carried out through a special purpose vehicle in Luxembourg. At Paroc Group level, the plan is treated as equity-settled share-based payment transaction where Paroc

<<<

 Group has no obligation to settle the share-based payment transaction under normal conditions. Participants have bought their shares at fair value.
Provisions A provision is recognized when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation

<<<

 as a result of past events and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and when a reliable estimate of the amount can be made. A provision is measured at the present value of the expenditure required

<<<

 to settle the obligation. The discount factor used in the calculation of the present value is determined so that it reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money. Environmental provisions are recognized, based on current

<<<

 interpretation of environmental laws and regulations, when it is probable that present obligation has arisen and the amount of such liability can be reliably estimated. Paroc also has a liability for deliveries of defective goods. This liability

<<<

 is not a warranty for the future years but instead an obligation to replace defective goods either with new goods or with a credit note.
Employee benefits Pension obligations Within Paroc there are several pension schemes following local regulation

<<<

 and practice in each country. The plans are classified as either defined benefit plans or defined contribution plans. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The Group

<<<

 has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. Contributions to defined contribution

<<<

 plans are recognized as an expense in the period the employee has rendered the service. Defined benefit plans are post-employment benefits plans other than defined contribution plans. A defined benefit plans usually define an amount of pension

<<<

 benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, year of service and compensation. The liability recognized in the balance sheet with respect to defined benefit pension plans is the

<<<

 present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. For defined benefit plans, pension costs are assessed using the Projected Unit Credit Method with actuarial valuations being

<<<

 carried out at each balance sheet date. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency

<<<

 in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.

2. Sum m ary of significant accounting policies

<<<

 (C ontinued)
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity through other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. Service cost is recognized

<<<

 immediately in the consolidated statement of income.
Top management located in Finland and Sweden has individual voluntary pension plans. These plans entitle a pension benefit at the age of 62 and they are classified as defined contribution

<<<

 plans.

Other long-term employee benefits
Paroc also has other employee benefits such as jubilee benefits, long-service benefits and bonus arrangements, which are not payable wholly within 12 months after the end of the reporting period. The

<<<

 Group recognizes a provision when contractually obliged or when there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation for settlement, resulting in an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits. Remeasurements caused by other

<<<

 long-term employee benefits are recognized immediately in the consolidated statement of income.

Transactions w ith owners
Dividend distribution
A dividend liability to the Company's shareholders is recognized as a liability in the consolidated

<<<

 financial statements when a meeting of shareholders has decided on a dividend distribution.

Capital return
The Finnish legislation allows a Finnish subsidiary or parent to give tax deductible group contribution to another Finnish group company

<<<

 when statutory requirements are met. Group contribution system in Finland is governed by a special law, the Act on Contributions between Affiliated Companies. In the consolidated financial statements group contribution is included in the retained

<<<

 earnings in the equity. The group contribution liability is recognized as current liability when the decision on group contribution has been made.

O perating profit
IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements does not define operating profit

<<<

. The Group has defined it as follows: operating profit is a net amount, comprised of net sales added to other operating income, deducted with purchases adjusted for the change in finished goods and work in progress inventories and costs related

<<<

 to goods manufactured for private consumption and deductions for employment benefits, impairment losses and other operating expenses. All other statement of income items are presented below operating profit.

As a result on the impairment tests performed, no impairment losses have been recognized on goodwill in

<<<

 2013, 2012 or 2011.
Value-in-use calculations are made to estimate the recoverable amounts of CGUs. The calculations use pre-tax cash flows based on three-year strategy approved by the Board of Directors excluding any cash flows from expansion

<<<

 investments, and a growth rate to perpetuity of 2% (2012: 2%) per annum of cash flows beyond the budgeted period, which corresponds to the realized long-term growth of the CGUs and business areas in question. The key assumptions used in cash

<<<

 flow projections are based on management estimates and estimates made by Euroconstruct and VTT Technical Research Center of Finland. The most significant key assumptions affecting the projections are the development of residential construction

<<<

 business, and also the development of commercial building construction business which has an effect on Paroc panels.
Discount rates used in the calculations are the pre-tax weighted average cost of capital (WACC). WACC consists of peer group

<<<

 unlevered beta and risk free rate per country, targeted debt to equity ratio, and equity market risk premium per country. The following WACCs were used:

For Insulation Finland an increase in discount rate of 0.5 percentage points or any other reduction in gross margin of 1.2 percentage points, of the estimated gross margins would cause the CGU's recoverable amount to be equal to its

<<<

 carrying amount. According to the management's assumption, in other cash generating units, any reasonably possible change in a key variable would not create a situation in which the unit's carrying value would exceed its value in use.

Emission

 allowances
The European Emission Trading Scheme started on January 1, 2005. In the beginning of 2008 emission rights were extended to cover the manufacturing of mineral wool. Paroc's sites included in the European Emission Trading Scheme are

<<<

 the plants in Finland, Sweden, Poland and Lithuania.
The following table summarizes the Group's emission allowances held as of December 31, 2013. Their carrying value (acquisition cost) was 2.2 million at December 31, 2013. The Group's emission

<<<

 rights granted for free in 2013 amounted to 216,171 tons (2012: 293,179 tons). New emission rights were not acquired in 2013 (2012: 0 tons). Emission rights consumed by the Group in 2013 amounted 269,018 tons (2012: 229,390 tons).
At the year

The classification is based on IFRS 7 guidance, according to which level 1 instruments are traded in active markets and their fair values are based on market quotations. The fair values of level 2 instruments are determined by

<<<

 using valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximize the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. The fair values of level 3 instruments are based on non-observable

<<<

 market data.
Available-for-sale financial assets cannot be measured at fair value, as fair values are not available, and are classified as level 3 instruments. The carrying amount is the management's best estimate of the fair value of available

<<<

-for-sale financial assets.

17. Financial risk management Substantial parts of Paroc's operations are international and are highly leveraged. Consequently, the Group is exposed to a variety of financial risks. These risks can be split into

<<<

 the following areas:  Interest rate risk  Currency risk  Commodity price risk

F-33

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
17. Financial risk management (Continued)
 Liquidity risk
 Credit risk
The Group Treasury

<<<

, which is legally located within Paroc Oy Ab in Finland, has the main responsibility to manage financial risks. The parent company Board of Directors has approved the treasury policy, which defines operative guidelines and responsibilities

<<<

 of risk management.
Interest rate risk
Paroc is exposed to interest rate risk due to its 350 million external debt. Existing loan agreements (Super Senior Revolving Facility Agreement and Senior Notes) have been valid since 23 December 200

<<<

9. The interest rate risk is managed based on the treasury policy. The terms and conditions of the loans allow the Group to choose interest periods of anything between one and 12 months at every interest selection date. The senior loans have

<<<

 been fully hedged with interest rate swaps up to February 2015 whereby the Group pays fixed interest and receives three month Euribor. Cash flow hedge accounting is applied and the effective portion part of the changes in the fair value of

<<<

 derivatives that are designated hedges is recognized in other comprehensive income.
Group Treasury constantly follows financial markets development and frequently meets the CFO in order to implement proper measures to manage interest rate risk

<<<

.
Foreign exchange risk
Paroc is exposed to the Swedish krona, the Norwegian krone, the Danish krone, the Lithuanian litas, Polish zloty, Russian ruble, British pound and the US dollar. The Group policy is that sales companies generate revenue

<<<

 and incur expenses in their respective operating or functional currencies The Group's currency risk is thus concentrated to the producing countries. The Group has investments in foreign operations, whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency

<<<

 translation risk but the Group does not hedge its net assets of its foreign operations. As per the approved treasury policy, the producing countries hedge their estimated six month rolling cash flows and partially hedge that internally with

<<<

 Group Treasury. The Treasury enters into external hedging transactions with banks. The instruments used are foreign exchange forwards. Cash flow hedge accounting is applied hence the gain or loss relating to the effective portion of the changes

<<<

 in the fair value of derivatives that are designated hedges is recognized in other comprehensive income. A part of the fluctuation in market value of the hedging instruments is shown in the fair value reserve under equity, changes recorded

<<<

 in other comprehensive income.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to fulfil present or future obligations if the Company does not have sufficient funds available to meet such obligations. Liquidity risk arises mostly

<<<

 in relation to cash flows generated and used in financing activities, and particularly by servicing debt, in terms of both interest and principal, and Company's payment obligations relating to ordinary business activities.
Paroc has a Super

<<<

 Senior Revolving Facility Agreement with a nominal amount of 25 million. The revolving credit facility (RCF) can be drawn, used for bank guarantees or allocated as overdraft facilities on bank accounts. The facility is committed and can be

<<<

 drawn fully with three banking days' notice. The purpose of the facility is to balance changes in working capital.
At year-end 2013 the facility was fully available. The available liquidity, defined as cash and cash equivalents added with unutilized

<<<

 committed facilities, was 94.6 million at December 31, 2013 (2012: 109.6 million)
All of the Group's excess liquidity has been centralized to the Group Treasury, which takes internal deposits and pays interest based on the financial items transfer

<<<

 pricing policy. Group companies, which need financing, can consequently borrow internally from the Group Treasury. The Group operates cross border cash pools that aim to improve the utilization of the Group's liquidity. Group Treasury makes

<<<

 short term external deposits with accepted banking counterparties. The aim is to obtain competitive yield without compromising the capital.
F-34

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
17. Financial risk management (Continued

<<<

)
The Group Treasury monitors the liquidity on a daily basis. The minimum level of cash available has been set to 25 million including cash on accounts and overdraft facilities.
The Group Treasurer decides on the banks used by Paroc Group together

<<<

 with the CFO. Primary selection is based on banks who are participating in the Group financing and one main bank for cash management. The Group Treasury can place short term deposits with banks providing their rating in short-term obligations

<<<

 is at least P-1 (Moody's) or similar. The Group Treasury is responsible for follow up of counterpart ratings.
Commodity price
The Company is exposed to commodity price risk from price volatility with respect to raw materials and other input

<<<

 factors for production processes. Raw materials (including stone, coke, binder, steel, coatings and adhesives) and electricity used in production processes represent a significant proportion of cost of sales. In order to manage the risk of

<<<

 fluctuations in raw material and energy prices the Company enter into supply agreements covering significant portions of its expected raw material and energy requirements for set periods of time. The Company has not entered into derivative

<<<

 contracts to hedge raw material purchases.
The Company has a need to buy electricity for production purposes. Around half of the needed energy is consumed in Poland and Lithuania. The other half is consumed in Sweden and Finland. The Company

<<<

 has an electricity hedging policy stating that the electricity purchased for Lithuania and Poland is agreed through long-term contracts and fixed prices annually. For the Nordic countries the electricity purchases are based on rolling estimates

<<<

 for the coming three years. Treasury is purchasing electricity from the vendor in the form of long-term physical contracts, based on estimates from the production units. The price is fixed as percentage of estimated usage on a rolling three

<<<

 year basis. The first year is fixed 75-85%, the second year 35-45% and third year 10-20%. The price is agreed with the physical electricity vendor.
Credit risk
The Group's main exposure to credit risk relates to trade receivables and other

<<<

 financial assets, including cash and cash equivalents. The Group has no significant concentration of third-party credit risk due to the large number of customers that have spread across our markets. Group has adopted risk management procedures

<<<

 to both reduce and monitor credit risk and performs ongoing credit quality evaluations of customers and use external debt collection agencies under certain circumstances. In addition, the Company has insured its credit risk in trade receivables

<<<

. The insurance covers the sales in all significant countries. All sales above 5 thousand are covered with a deductible of 10%. The group also has its own internal credit policy, which specifies the principles, if an insurance company is not

<<<

 granting a limit to the customer. In these specific cases division management has the power to grant an internal limit up to 100,000 and from then on, the power lies with the Group CFO and CEO. The Group companies are following the status of

<<<

 trade receivables on a weekly basis. Ageing analysis of trade receivables is shown in note 19 Trade and other receivables.
Credit risk with respect to other financial assets, primarily comprising cash and cash equivalents, arises from the risk

<<<

 that the relevant counterparty becomes insolvent and is unable to return the deposited funds as a result of the insolvency. To mitigate this risk the Company seeks to transact and deposit funds with high-quality financial institutions that

<<<

 are deemed to be creditworthy, and whose transaction volumes are monitored in order to reduce the risk of concentrations of transactions with any single counterparty. The Company enters into short-term external deposits with approved banking

<<<

 counterparties that have a rating in short-term obligations with a minimum rating of P-1 (Moody's) or similar.
Management of capital risk
The target for risk management of capital is to ensure the Group's ability to continue as a going concern

<<<

 so that it would be able to provide returns to its owners and benefits to other interest groups. The target is to maintain an optimal capital structure in order to reduce financing costs. Management follows the Group's capital structure on

<<<

 a regular basis.
F-35

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

17. Financial risk management (Continued)
Investments and increase in working capital is financed mainly with cash flows from the operating activities.
The

<<<

 Group has in its loan conditions financial covenants, which are reported quarterly. The covenant terms relate to liquidity, equity ratio, solvency interest coverage, and investments. Note 25 includes more detailed information about covenants

<<<

.
At the end of the period the Group's liquid funds were 69.6 million at December 31, 2013 (2012: 72.2 million). Net debt amounted to 292.5 million at December 31, 2013 (2012: 291.4 million). Solidity was 24.4% at December 31, 2013 (2012: 2

<<<

2.3%). Liquidity in the near future is good.

Applied principles for sensitivity analysis
The impact from 1% increase in interest rate for financing cost within the next 12 months if the change had occurred at statement of financial position date. The sensitivity analysis includes

<<<

 interest bearing liabilities of the Group, where the re-pricing period is within the next 12 months. The sensitivity analysis has been calculated with same principles for the financial receivables of the Group. Loan interests have been hedged

<<<

 with interest instruments; therefore increase in market interest rates does not have an impact on interest expenses. The fluctuation of market value of the interest rate hedges is shown in other comprehensive income. The effect of a 1% increase

<<<

 in interest would increase the value of the interest rate hedge instruments by about 3.5 million.

In accordance with the Shareholders Agreement (SHA) the fair market value of the shares is determined annually in accordance with the principles set out in the SHA by an independent accountant. At the end of the financial year 2013 there were

<<<

 some 115 employees and four non-executive board members of Paroc Group companies holding shares in the said SPV (2012: some 118 employees and four non-executive board members, 2011: some 126 employees and four non-executive board members).

<<<

 The four non-executive board members also directly own 1.98% shares of Safari Luxco 2 S.A. with return on plan expected only at exit when certain threshold is exceeded. During 2013 there were no new employees participating in the plan under

<<<

 the SPV. In 2013 there were seven Leavers from the SPV (2012: no new employees and eight Leavers, 2011: one new employee and four Leavers).

23. Employee benefit obligations
In Finland employees are insured in accordance with the Employees

<<<

' Pension Act (TyEL). The earningsrelated pension provision is handled by pension insurance companies and it is classified as a defined contribution plan. Statutory earnings-related pension insurance provides security in case of old age, disability

<<<

, death of the family provider and unemployment of an aging person. The earnings-related benefits also include rehabilitation.
Top management located in Finland has individual voluntary pension plans. These plans entitle a pension at the age

<<<

 of 62. The plan was changed in 2010 so that it is classified as a defined contribution plan. The old defined benefit plan in Finland has been terminated.
The old pension liability in Sweden is still accounted for as a defined benefit plan in

<<<

 the financial statements (retirement obligation until 1993). Since 1993 the ITP-pension plan has been operated by Alecta and the plan is defined as a multi-employer defined benefit plan. Following the change of the operator of the plan, the

<<<

 measurement of the Swedish Alecta pension plan is still not possible as a defined benefit obligation considering the current regulation guideline in Sweden and the availability of the sufficient information for the calculations. Consequently

<<<

, the plan operated by Alecta has been accounted for as defined contribution plan in the consolidated financial statements.
In Lithuania, pension premiums are paid in every salary payment as a percentage of gross salary. These pensions are funded

<<<

 by the state social insurance fund and treated as a defined contribution plan.
In Poland, payments to the state treasury fund (ZUS) are made monthly on the basis of the actual value of salaries paid during the month and treated as defined contribution

<<<

 plan.
In other countries the pension arrangements are done in accordance with the local legislation and practice and they are treated as defined contribution plans.

A change in bond yields may trigger a change in the discount rate applied by the Group. This affects both the net defined benefit liability and remeasurements recognised in OCI. The Group's defined benefit pension obligations

 are linked to inflation and higher inflation increases the defined benefit obligation. The Group's defined benefit pension obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase

 in the defined benefit obligation.

 on February 28, 2014 into Paroc Sound IPCo 41523 Oy (2576449-6) and into established Paroc Oy Ab (2580556-9). Paroc Sverige AB (556688-7161) will be demerged into Paroc Sound HoldCo 41524 AB (556946-5700) and a new established Paroc Sverige

<<<

 AB. When the demerger process is complete a cross-border merger of Paroc Sound HoldCo 41524 AB into Paroc Group Oy will take place. After that Paroc Sound IPCo 41523 Oy will be merged into Paroc Group Oy. We expect the restructuring process

<<<

 to be completed in May 2014.
Preliminary ruling for the reorganization has been received from the Finnish tax authorities. The preliminary ruling for the transfer pricing methodology, whereby Paroc Group Oy would charge a concept fee to other

<<<

 Paroc Group companies, was also granted. However any specific pricing suggested was not approved.
On this basis the reorganization was decided to be done by transferring Paroc Group's intellectual property including patents, connected functions

<<<

 and the Paroc brand, initially held by Paroc Oy Ab, to Paroc Group Oy. A final decision on whether to adopt a concept fee model has not been done. Anticipated result of the restructuring is a more tax efficient position going forward.
