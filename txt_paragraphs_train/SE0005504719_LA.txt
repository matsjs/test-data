or, regarding any of the Issuer

<<<

's Subsidiaries (not being a Material Group Company), on the

grounds mentioned in Clauses 15.1 (e), (f), (g), (h), (i) and (j) above may only occur if the

nature of the particular circumstance is such that it would have a Material Adverse

<<<

 Effect

and that the cause of termination is continuing at the time of the Agent's declaration.

However, if a moratorium occurs, the ending of that moratorium will not prevent termination

for payment prematurely on the ground mentioned in

<<<

 Clause 15.1(e).

15.3

If the right to terminate the Bonds is based upon a decision of a court of law or a government

authority, it is not necessary that the decision has become enforceable under law or that the

period of appeal has expired

<<<

 in order for cause of termination to be deemed to exist.

15.4

The Issuer is obliged to inform the Agent immediately if any circumstance of the type

specified in Clause 15.1 should occur. Should the Agent not receive such information, the

<<<



Agent is entitled to assume that no such circumstance exists or can be expected to occur,

provided that the Agent does not have knowledge of such circumstance. The Agent is under

no obligations to make any investigations relating to the

<<<

 circumstances specified in

Clause 15.1. The Issuer shall further, at the request of the Agent, provide the Agent with

details of any circumstances referred to in Clause 15.1 and provide the Agent with all

documents that may be of significance

<<<

 for the application of this Clause 15.

15.5

The Issuer is only obliged to inform the Agent according to Clause 15.4 if informing the

Agent would not conflict with any statute or the Issuer's registration contract with First

North. If such

<<<

 a conflict would exist pursuant to the listing contract with First North or

otherwise, the Issuer shall however be obliged to either seek the approval from First North or

undertake other reasonable measures, including entering into a non

<<<

-disclosure agreement

with the Agent, in order to be able to timely inform the Agent according to Clause 15.4.

15.6

If the Agent has been notified by the Issuer or has otherwise determined that there is a

default under these Terms and Conditions

<<<

 according to Clause 15.1, the Agent shall decide,

within 20 Business Days of the day of notification or determination, if the Bonds shall be

declared terminated. If the Agent has decided not to terminate the Bonds, the Agent shall, at

the

<<<

 earliest possible date, notify the Holders that there exists a right of termination and

obtain instructions from the Holders according to the provisions in Clause 17 (Decisions by

Holders). If the Holders vote in favour of termination and

<<<

 instruct the Agent to terminate the

Bonds, the Agent shall promptly declare the Bonds terminated. However, if the cause for

termination according to the Agent's appraisal has ceased before the termination, the Agent

shall not terminate the

<<<

 Bonds. The Agent shall in such case, at the earliest possible date,

notify the Holders that the cause for termination has ceased. The Agent shall always be

27

15.7
15.8 15.9 15.10 16. 16.1

entitled to take the time necessary to consider

<<<

 whether an occurred event constitutes an Event of Default and whether such event has a Material Adverse Effect.
If the Holders, without any prior initiative to decision from the Agent or the Issuer, have made a decision regarding termination

<<<

 in accordance with Clause 17 (Decisions by Holders), the Agent shall promptly declare the Bonds terminated. The Agent is however not liable to take action if the Agent considers cause for termination not to be at hand, unless the instructing

<<<

 Holders agree in writing to indemnify and hold the Agent harmless from any loss or liability and, if requested by the Agent in its discretion, grant sufficient security for such indemnity.
If the Bonds are declared due and payable in accordance

<<<

 with the provisions in this Clause 15, the Agent shall take every reasonable measure necessary to recover the amounts outstanding under the Bonds.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Bonds cannot be terminated and become due for payment prematurely

<<<

 according to this Clause 15 without relevant decision by the Agent or following instructions from the Holders' pursuant to Clause 17 (Decisions by Holders).
If the Bonds are declared due and payable, the Issuer shall redeem all Bonds with a

<<<

&&& redemption amount equal to 104.00 per cent. of the Nominal Amount or such lower amount as set forth in the Call Option Amount, as applicable considering when the acceleration occurs.

If the Bonds have been declared

<<<

 due and payable due to an Event of Default, all payments by the Issuer relating to the Bonds shall be distributed in the following order of priority, in accordance with the instructions of the Agent:

<<<


(d) fourthly, in or towards payment pro rata of any other costs or outstanding amounts unpaid under the Terms and Conditions.
Any excess funds after the application of proceeds in accordance with paragraphs (a) to (d) above shall be paid to

<<<

 the Issuer. The application of proceeds in accordance with paragraphs (a) to (d) above shall, however, not restrict a Holders' Meeting or a Written Procedure from
28

resolving that accrued Interest (whether overdue or not) shall be reduced

<<<

 without a corresponding reduction of principal.

16.2

If a Holder or another party has paid any fees, costs, expenses or indemnities referred to in

Clause 16.1, such Holder or other party shall be entitled to reimbursement by way of a

corresponding

<<<

 distribution in accordance with Clause 16.1.

16.3

Funds that the Agent receives (directly or indirectly) in connection with the termination of

the Bonds and/or enforcement of any or all of the security created under the Finance

Documents

<<<

 constitute escrow funds (Sw. redovisningsmedel) according to the Escrow Funds

Act (Sw. lag (1944:181) om redovisningsmedel) and must be held on a separate interest

bearing account on behalf of the Holders and the other interested parties

practicable.
