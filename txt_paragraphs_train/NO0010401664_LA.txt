<<<

 the Borrower with respect to the conversion of their respective Bonds and as to the registration of certificates representing Shares issuable to it upon such conversion as well as to the payment of any monies owing to them pursuant to the terms

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA
(h) The Bondholders acknowledge that the issuance of new Shares to the Bondholders according to this Loan

<<<

 Agreement on any relevant Banking Day is subject to simultaneous (or prior) payment by way of discharge of the Outstanding Loan amount and the Bonds (in part or in full whichever is applicable). The Bondholders undertake to, on the Borrower

<<<

's request, to give such notices, and/or authorizations to its account manager and/or the Paying Agent that may be required in order for the Paying Agent to discharge the Outstanding Loan amount and the Bonds (in part or in full whichever is

<<<

 applicable) no later than simultaneously with the issuance of the new Shares upon conversion.
15 Adjustment of the Conversion Price
15.1 The Conversion Price in effect at any date will be subject to adjustment from time to time in the events

<<<

 and in the manner provided as follows:
(a) If and whenever at any time after the date hereof and prior to the Maturity Date, the Borrower:
(i) issues Shares or securities exchangeable for or convertible into Shares to the holders of all or

<<<

 substantially all of the outstanding Shares as a stock dividend;
(ii) makes a distribution on its outstanding Shares to the holders of all, or substantially all, of the outstanding Shares payable in Shares or securities exchangeable for or

<<<

 convertible into Shares;
(iii) subdivides or re-divides its outstanding Shares into a greater number of Shares; or
(iv) reduces, combines or consolidates its outstanding Shares into a smaller number of Shares,
(any of such events in subsections

<<<

 (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) being called a "Share Reorganization"), then the Conversion Price then in effect will be adjusted effective immediately on the effective date or record date for the happening of a Share Reorganization, as the case

<<<

 may be, at which the holders of Shares are determined for the purpose of the Share Reorganization, so that it shall equal the price determined by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect on such effective date or record date by a fraction

<<<

, the numerator of which will be the total number of Shares outstanding on such effective date or record date before giving effect to such Share Reorganization and the denominator of which will be the total number of Shares outstanding immediately

<<<

 after giving effect to such Share Reorganization (including, in the case where securities exchangeable for or convertible into Shares are distributed, the number of Shares that would have been outstanding had all such securities been exchanged

<<<

 for or converted into Shares on such effective date or record date).
(b) If and whenever at any time after the date hereof and prior to the Maturity Date, the Borrower fixes a record date for the issue of rights, options or warrants to the

<<<

 holders of all or substantially all of the Shares under which
17

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA
such holders are entitled, during a period expiring not more than forty five (45) days after the date of such issue (the "Rights Period"), to subscribe

<<<

 for or purchase Shares or securities exchangeable for or convertible into Shares at a price per share to the holder (or at an exchange or conversion price per share during the Rights Period to the holder in the case of securities exchangeable

<<<

 for or convertible into Shares) of less than 95% of the Current Market Price for the Shares on such record date (any of such events being called a "Rights Offering"), then the Conversion Price will be adjusted effective immediately after the

<<<

 end of the Rights Period so that it shall equal the price determined by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the end of the Rights Period by a fraction:
(i) the numerator of which will be the aggregate of:
A. the

<<<

 total number of Shares outstanding as of the record date for the Rights Offering, and
B. a number determined by dividing (I) either (x) the product of the number of Shares issued or subscribed for during the Rights Period upon the exercise

<<<

 of the rights, warrants or options under the Rights Offering and the price at which such Shares are offered, or, as the case may be, (y) the product of the exchange or conversion price of such securities exchangeable for or convertible into

<<<

 Shares and the number of Shares for or into which the securities so offered pursuant to the Rights Offering could have been exchanged or converted during the Rights Period, by (II) the Current Market Price of the Shares as of the record date

<<<

 for the Rights Offering, and
(ii) the denominator of which will be the number of Shares outstanding, or the number of Shares which would be outstanding if all the exchangeable or convertible securities were exchanged for or converted into Shares

<<<

 during the Rights Period, after giving effect to the Rights Offering and including the number of Shares actually issued or subscribed for during the Rights Period upon exercise of the rights, warrants or options under the Rights Offering.
Any

<<<

 Bondholder who has exercised the right to convert to Shares in accordance with Clause 13 during the period beginning immediately after the record date for a Rights Offering and ending on the last day of the Rights Period for the Rights Offering

<<<

 will, in addition to the Shares to which that holder would otherwise be entitled upon such conversion, be entitled to that number of additional Shares equal to the result obtained when the difference, if any, between the Conversion Price in

<<<

 effect immediately prior to the end of such Rights Offering and the Conversion Price as adjusted for such Rights Offering pursuant to this subsection is multiplied by the number of Shares received upon the conversion of the Bonds held by such

<<<

 Bondholder during such period, and the resulting product is divided by the Conversion Price as adjusted for such Rights Offering pursuant to this Clause 15.1 (b). Such additional Shares will be deemed to have been issued to the Bondholder immediately

<<<

 following the end of the Rights Period and a certificate for such
18

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA
additional Shares will be delivered to such Bondholder within fifteen (15) Business Days following the end of the Rights Period. To the extent that

<<<

 any such rights, options or warrants are not so exercised on or before the expiry thereof, the Conversion Price will be readjusted to the Conversion Price which would then be in effect based on the number of Shares (or the securities convertible

<<<

 into or exchangeable for Shares) actually delivered on the exercise of such rights, options or warrants.
(c) If and whenever at any time after the date hereof and prior to the Maturity Date, the Borrower fixes a record date for the issue or

<<<

 the distribution to the holders of all or substantially all of the Shares of (i) securities of the Borrower, including rights, options or warrants to acquire securities of the Borrower or any of its property or assets and including evidences

<<<

 of indebtedness, or (ii) any property or other assets (including cash dividends and distribution of securities (including the Petrominerales Ltd. shares)), including evidences of indebtedness, and if such issuance or distribution does not constitute

<<<

 a Share Reorganization or a Rights Offering (any of such non-excluded events being called a "Special Distribution"), the Conversion Price will be adjusted effective immediately after such record date to a price determined by multiplying the

<<<

 Conversion Price in effect on such record date by a fraction:
(i) the numerator of which will be:
A. the product of the number of Shares outstanding on such record date and the Current Market Price of the Shares on such record date; less
B

<<<

. the fair market value, as determined by action by the directors of the Borrower, acting reasonably, (which determination, will be conclusive), to the holders of Shares of such securities or property or other assets so issued or distributed

<<<

 in the Special Distribution; and
(ii) the denominator of which will be the product of the number of Shares outstanding on such record date and the Current Market Price of the Shares on such record date.
To the extent that any Special Distribution

<<<

 is not so made, the Conversion Price will be readjusted effective immediately to the Conversion Price which would then be in effect based upon such securities or property or other assets as actually distributed.
The Borrower has the right to

<<<

 give all the Bondholders any offer, as an alternative to any adjustment according to this Clause 15.1. (c), which can be accepted (or declined) by all or a portion of the Bondholders.
(d) If the purchase price provided for in any rights, options

<<<

 or warrants (the "Rights Offering Price") referred to in Clauses 15.1 (b) or (c) is decreased, the Conversion Price will forthwith be changed so as to decrease the Conversion Price to the Conversion Price that would have been obtained if the

<<<

 adjustment to the Conversion Price made under Clauses 15.1 (b) or (c), as the
19
G

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA
case may be, with respect to such rights, options or warrants had been made on the basis of the Rights Offering Price as so decreased

<<<

, provided that the terms of this Clause 15.1 (d) will not apply to any decrease in the Rights Offering Price resulting from terms in any such rights, options or warrants designed to prevent dilution except to the extent that the resulting decrease

<<<

 in the Conversion Price under this Clause 15.1 (d) would be greater than the decrease, if any, in the Conversion Price to be made under the terms of this Clause by virtue of the occurrence of the event giving rise to such decrease in the Rights

<<<

 Offering Price.
(e) If and whenever at any time after the date hereof and prior to the Maturity Date, there is a reclassification of the Shares at any time outstanding or change of the Shares into other shares or into other securities or other

<<<

 capital reorganization (other than a Share Reorganization), or a consolidation, amalgamation, arrangement or merger of the Borrower with or into any other corporation or other entity (other than a vertical short-form amalgamation with one or

<<<

 more of its Subsidiaries), or a transfer of the undertaking or assets of the Borrower as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to another corporation or other entity in which the holders of Shares are entitled to receive shares, other

<<<

 securities or other property, or a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Borrower (any of such events being called a "Capital Reorganization"), any Bondholder who exercises the right to convert Bonds into Shares pursuant to Bonds then

<<<

 held after the effective date of such Capital Reorganization will be entitled to receive, and will accept for the same aggregate consideration in lieu of the number of Shares to which such Bondholder was previously entitled upon such conversion

<<<

, the aggregate number of shares, other securities or other property which such Bondholder would have been entitled to receive as a result of such Capital Reorganization if, on the effective date thereof, the Bondholder had been the registered

<<<

 holder of the number of Shares to which such holder was previously entitled upon conversion. The Borrower will take all steps necessary to ensure that, on a Capital Reorganization, the holders of Bonds will receive the aggregate number of shares

<<<

, other securities or other property to which they are entitled as a result of the Capital Reorganization. Appropriate adjustments will be made as a result of any such Capital Reorganization in the application of the provisions set forth in

<<<

 this Clause 15.1 with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of holders of Bonds to the end that the provisions set forth in this Clause 15.1 will thereafter correspondingly be made applicable as nearly as may reasonably be in relation

<<<

 to any shares, other securities or other property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of any Bond.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower shall not effect any Capital Reorganization unless, prior to or concurrent therewith, an appropriate

<<<

 adjustment to give effect to this subsection is made by and set forth in an amending agreement hereto or agreement with the Borrower's successor or such purchasing corporation or entity as applicable in each case approved by action of the Board

<<<

 of Directors of the Borrower and by the Loan Trustee, in which event such adjustment will for all purposes be conclusively deemed to be an appropriate adjustment, subject to the prior written consent of the Toronto Stock Exchange and any other

<<<

 applicable regulatory approval or
20

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA
consent.
(f) If and whenever at any time after the date hereof and prior to the Maturity Date, the Borrower makes changes in the share capital other than those mentioned in Clauses

<<<

 15.1 (a) - (e) above, which are unfavourable to the Bondholders compared to the shareholders of the Borrower, the Loan Trustee and the Borrower shall agree on a new Conversion Price. The principles expressed in Clauses 15.1 (a) - (e) above

<<<

 shall always be the basis for any adjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this Clause 15.1 (f).
15.2 In any case in which Clause 15.1 shall require that an adjustment shall become effective immediately after a record date for an event

<<<

 referred to herein, the Borrower may defer, until the occurrence of such event, issuing to the Bondholder of any Bond converted after such record date and before the occurrence of such event the additional Shares issuable upon such conversion

<<<

 by reason of the adjustment required by such event, provided, however, that the Borrower shall deliver to such Bondholder an appropriate instrument evidencing such Bondholder's right to receive such additional Shares upon the occurrence of

<<<

 such event and the right to receive any distributions made on such additional Shares declared in favour of holders of record o f Shares on and after the Conversion Date or such later date on which such Bondholder would, but for the provisions

<<<

 of this Clause 15.2, have become the holder of record of such additional Shares pursuant to Clause 13.
15.3 The adjustments provided for in Clause 15.1 are cumulative and will be made successively whenever an event referred to therein occurs

<<<

, subject to the following subsections of this section, provided that, no adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be required unless such adjustment would require and increase or decrease of at least 1% in the Conversion Price then in effect

<<<

 provided, however, that any adjustments which by reason of this Clause are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment.
15.4 No adjustment in the Conversion Price will be required upon

<<<

 the issuance from time to time of Shares pursuant to any Share Compensation Plan, as such plans may be replaced, supplemented or further amended from time to time, or upon exercise of outstanding rights or agreements, including options, warrants

<<<

 and other convertible securities including any rights which have been granted or issued by the Borrower.
15.5 Subject to the prior consent of the Toronto Stock Exchange and any other applicable regulatory consent or approval, no adjustment

<<<

 in the Conversion Price will be made in respect of any event described in Clause 15.1 (a), (b) or (c), other than the events referred to in Clauses 15.1 (a) (iii) and (iv), if Bondholders are entitled to participate in such event on the same

<<<

 terms, mutatis mutandis, as if they had converted their Bonds prior to or on the effective date or record date of such event.
15.6 If at any time a dispute arises with respect to adjustments provided for in Clause 15.1, such dispute will be

<<<

 conclusively determined, subject to the Toronto Stock Exchange's consent and any other applicable regulatory approvals or consents, a Calgary office of a major Canadian, internationally recognized firm of independent chartered accountants as

<<<

 may be selected by action of the directors of the Borrower and approval by the Loan Trustee (without a Bondholders' meeting being and such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and any such determination will be binding
21



<<<

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA
upon the Borrower, the Loan Trustee, the Bondholders and shareholders of the Borrower; such firm of chartered accountants will be given access to all necessary records of the Borrower. If any such determination is made

<<<

, the Borrower will deliver a Certificate of the Borrower to the Loan Trustee describing such determination and the Loan Trustee shall be entitled to act and rely upon such Certificate of the Borrower.
15.7 To the extent a currency conversion

<<<

 to United States dollars is required in connection with adjustments of the Conversion Price in accordance with this Clause 15, such currency conversion shall be made in accordance with the Exchange Rate
In the event that the Shares are listed

<<<

 on two or more Exchanges, the Toronto Stock Exchange shall be preferred for all purposes under this Agreement unless the Borrower and the Loan Trustee otherwise agree in writing.
15.8 If the Borrower sets a record date to determine the holders

<<<

 of Shares for the purpose of entitling them to receive any dividend or distribution or sets a record date to take any other action and thereafter and before the distribution to such shareholders of any such dividend or distribution or the taking

<<<

 of any other action, legally abandons its plan to pay or deliver such dividend or distribution or take such other action, then no adjustment in the Conversion Price shall be made and any related adjustments that were made shall be reversed

<<<

.
15.9 In the absence of a resolution of the directors of the Borrower fixing a record date for a Special Distribution or Rights Offering, the Borrower will be deemed to have fixed as the record date therefor the date on which the Special Distribution

<<<

 or Rights Offering is effected.
15.10 The Borrower shall not be required to issue fractional Shares upon the conversion of Bonds. If more than one Bond shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same Bondholder, the number of whole

<<<

 Shares issuable upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Bonds to be converted. If any fractional interest in a Share would, except for the provisions of this section, be deliverable upon

<<<

 the conversion of any principal amount of Bonds, the Borrower may, at its option, in lieu of delivering any certificate of such fractional interest, satisfy such fractional interest by paying to the Bondholder of such surrendered Bonds an amount

<<<

 in lawful money of Canada equal (computed to the nearest cent) to such fractional interest multiplied by the Current Market Price of the Shares on the Date of Conversion.
15.11 The Borrower covenants that it will at all times reserve and keep

<<<

 available out of its authorized Shares (if the number thereof is or becomes limited) solely for the purpose of issue upon conversion of Bonds as provided herein, and allot for issue to Bondholders who may exercise their conversion rights hereunder

<<<

, such number of Shares as shall then be issuable upon the conversion of all outstanding Bonds. All Shares which shall be so issuable shall, when issued, be duly and validly issued as fully paid and non-assessable.
15.12 If at any time, any

<<<

 order, ruling, registration, notice or filing pursuant to any securities laws of Canada or any province thereof is required to ensure that any Shares issuable upon the conversion of the Bonds are issued in compliance with all such laws or to

<<<


22

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA
ensure that any such Shares, once issued, are not subject to any general restriction as to the resale thereof under the securities laws of Canada or any province thereof, the Borrower covenants that it will take all

<<<

 such action as may be necessary to make or obtain such order, ruling, registration or filing, or give such notice as the case may be.
15.13 All Bonds must be converted in whole and shall be forthwith delivered to and cancelled by the Paying

<<<

 Agent.
15.14 The Borrower shall from time to time, immediately after the occurrence of any event which requires an adjustment or readjustment as provided in Clause 15.1, deliver a Certificate of the Borrower to the Loan Trustee specifying the

<<<

 nature of the event requiring the same and the amount of the adjustment or readjustment necessitated thereby and setting forth in reasonable detail the method of calculation and the facts upon which such calculation is based and shall include

<<<

 the verification referred to below, if applicable, and the Loan Trustee shall be entitled to act and rely upon such Certificate of the Borrower. In the event that the readjustment changes the Conversion Price by more than five percent (5.0

<<<

0%), such Certificate of the Borrower and the amount of the adjustment specified therein shall be verified by an opinion of a Bogata (Colombia) office of a Canadian internationally recognized firm of chartered accountants appointed by the Borrower

<<<

 and consented to by the Loan Trustee acting reasonably and without delay (who may be the auditors of the Borrower) and shall be conclusive and binding on all parties in interest. Until such Certificate of the Borrower is received by the Loan

<<<

 Trustee, the Loan Trustee may act and be protected in acting on the presumption that no adjustment has been made or is required. Except in respect of any subdivision, re-division, reduction, combination or consolidation of the Shares, the Borrower

<<<

 shall forthwith give notice to the Bondholders specifying the event requiring such adjustment or readjustment and the amount thereof, including the resulting Conversion Price.
15.15 Subject to Clause 15.14, the Borrower covenants that, so long

<<<

 as any Bonds remain outstanding, it will give notice to the Loan Trustee and to the Bondholders of its intention to fix a record date for any event referred to in Clause 15.1(a), (b), (c), or (e) (other than the subdivision, re-division, reduction

<<<

, combination or consolidation of Shares) or a cash dividend which may give rise to an adjustment in the Conversion Price, or other adjustment, and such notice shall specify the particulars of such event and the record date and the effective

<<<

 date for such event; provided that the Borrower shall only be required to specify in such notice such particulars of such event as shall have been fixed and determined on the date on which such notice is given. Such notice shall be given not

<<<

 less than fourteen (14) days prior to the applicable record date in the case of an event referred to in Clauses 15.1 (a), (b) or (c) and thirty (30) days prior to the applicable record date in the case of an event referred to in Clause 15.

<<<

1 (e).
15.16 Notwithstanding the provisions of Clause 15.15, the Borrower shall not be required to give the notice referred to in Clause 15.15 if the Borrower has given notice of a proposed Change of Control in accordance with the provisions

<<<

 of Clause 16.1 (j).
15.17 If changes are made to the share capital of the Borrower other than those mentioned above in this Clause 15, which are materially unfavourable to the Bondholders compared to shareholders of the Borrower, the Loan Trustee

<<<

 and the Borrower shall agree on a new Conversion Price as is equitable in the circumstances. The principles
23

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA
expressed in this Clause 15 shall always be the basis for any adjustments pursuant to this Clause.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any holder of secured indebtedness of the Borrower or any Subsidiary

<<<

, shall be entitled to rely, without independent inquiry, on a certificate from an officer of the Borrower, that the Borrower is in compliance this paragraph (b) after giving effect to the incurrence of all secured indebtedness of the Group

<<<

.
(c) not permit any member of the Group to engage in, directly or indirectly, any material transaction with any party, except in the ordinary course of such member of the Group's business and upon fair and reasonable terms that are no less

<<<

 Loan Agreement.
16.3 During the term of the Loan, the Borrower shall (unless the Loan Trustee or the Bondholders' meeting (as the case may be) in writing has agreed to otherwise) ensure that the Group (on a consolidated basis) maintains an

26

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA
power to tax ("Taxes"), unless the Borrower is required by law or by the interpretation or administration thereof by the relevant government authority or agency to withhold or deduct any amount for or on account of

<<<

 Taxes, in which case the Borrower will m ake the required withholding or deduction, make payment of the amount so withheld or deducted to the appropriate government authority and pay such additional amounts ("Additional Amounts") to each Bondholder

<<<

 as may be necessary to ensure that the net amounts received by each Bondholder after the withholding or deduction (including any withholding or deduction from such Additional Amounts) will not be less than the amounts of principal and interest
