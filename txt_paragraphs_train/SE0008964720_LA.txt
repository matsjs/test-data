(i) Any Material Group Company is unable or admits inability to pay its debts as they fall due or is declared to be

<<<

 unable to pay its debts under applicable law, suspends making payments on its debts generally or, by reason of actual or anticipated financial difficulties, commences negotiations with its creditors (other than under these Terms and Conditions

(e) Insolvency proceedings: Any corporate action, legal proceedings or other

specific Event of Default if it is no longer continuing or if it has been decided, in accordance

with these Terms and Conditions, to waive such Event

<<<

 of Default (temporarily or

permanently). However, if a moratorium occurs, the ending of that moratorium will not

prevent termination for payment prematurely on the ground mentioned under

Clause 14.1 (d).

14.3

If the right to terminate

<<<

 the Bonds is based upon a decision of a court of law or a government

authority, it is not necessary that the decision has become enforceable under law or that the

period of appeal has expired in order for cause of termination to be deemed

<<<

 to exist.

14.4

The Issuer is obligated to inform the Agent immediately if any circumstance of the type

specified in Clause 14.1 should occur. Should the Agent not receive such information, the

Agent is entitled to assume that no such circumstance

provided that the Agent does not have knowledge of such circumstance. The Agent is under

no obligations to make any investigations relating to the circumstances specified in

Clause 14.1. The Issuer shall

details of any circumstances referred to in Clause 14.1 and provide the Agent with all

documents that may be of significance for the application of this Clause 14.

The Issuer

<<<

 is only obligated to inform the Agent according to Clause 14.4 if informing the

Agent would not conflict with any statute or the Issuer's registration contract with Nasdaq

Stockholm (or any other Regulated Market, as applicable). If such

<<<

 a conflict would exist

pursuant to the listing contract with the relevant Regulated Market or otherwise, the Issuer

shall however be obligated to either seek the approval from the relevant Regulated Market or

undertake other reasonable measures

<<<

, including entering into a non-disclosure agreement

with the Agent, in order to be able to timely inform the Agent according to Clause 14.4.

14.6

notify, within five (5) Business Days of the day of notification or determination, the Holders

of the default and (ii) decide, within twenty (20) Business Days

<<<

 of the day of notification or

determination, if the Bonds shall be declared terminated. If the Agent has decided not to

terminate the Bonds, the Agent shall, at the earliest possible date, notify the Holders that

there exists a right of

<<<

 termination and obtain instructions from the Holders according to the

provisions in Clause 16 (Decisions by Holders). If the Holders vote in favour of termination

and instruct the Agent to terminate the Bonds, the Agent shall promptly declare

<<<

 the Bonds

terminated. However, if the cause for termination according to the Agent's appraisal has

ceased before the termination, the Agent shall not terminate the Bonds. The Agent shall in

such case, at the earliest possible date, notify

<<<

 the Holders that the cause for termination has

ceased. The Agent shall always be entitled to take the time necessary to consider whether an

occurred event constitutes an Event of Default.

14.7
14.8 14.9 14.10 15. 15.1

If the Holders, without

<<<

 any prior initiative to decision from the Agent or the Issuer, have made a decision regarding termination in accordance with Clause 16 (Decisions by Holders), the Agent shall promptly declare the Bonds terminated. The Agent is however not liable

<<<

 to take action if the Agent considers cause for termination not to be at hand, unless the instructing Holders agree in writing to indemnify and hold the Agent harmless from any loss or liability and, if requested by the Agent in its discretion

<<<

, grant sufficient security for such indemnity.
If the Bonds are declared due and payable in accordance with the provisions in this Clause 14, the Agent shall take every reasonable measure necessary to recover the amounts outstanding under the

<<<

 Bonds.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Bonds cannot be terminated and become due for payment prematurely according to this Clause 14 without relevant decision by the Agent or following instructions from the Holders' pursuant to Clause 16 (Decisions

<<<

&&& by Holders).
If the Bonds are declared due and payable in accordance with this Clause 14, the Issuer shall redeem all Bonds with an amount per Bond equal to the applicable Call Option Price together with accrued but unpaid Interest.
DISTRIBUTION

<<<

 OF PROCEEDS
If the Bonds have been declared due and payable in accordance with Clause 14 (Termination of the Bonds), all payments by the Issuer or the Guarantor (as applicable) relating to the Bonds shall be distributed in the following order

<<<

 pro rata of any other costs or outstanding amounts unpaid under the Finance Documents.
Any excess funds after the application of proceeds in accordance with items (a) to (d) above shall be paid to the Issuer or the Guarantor (as applicable

<<<

). The application of proceeds in accordance with items (a) to (d) above shall, however, not restrict a Holders' Meeting or a

Written Procedure from resolving that accrued Interest (whether overdue or not) shall be reduced without a corresponding

<<<

 reduction of principal.

15.2

If a Holder or another party has paid any fees, costs, expenses or indemnities referred to in

Clause 15.1, such Holder or other party shall be entitled to reimbursement by way of a

corresponding distribution

<<<

 in accordance with Clause 15.1.

15.3

If the Issuer or the Agent shall make any payment under this Clause 15, the Issuer or the

Agent, as applicable, shall notify the Holders of any such payment at least fifteen (15)

<<<

 any other Holder who has consented to the Agent in doing so.

<<<

 liable for any delay (or any related consequences) in crediting an account with an amount required pursuant to the Finance Documents to be paid by the Agent to the Holders, provided that the Agent has taken all necessary steps as soon as reasonably

<<<

 appointed.
If the Holders have not appointed a successor Agent within ninety (90) calendar days after (i) the earlier of the notice of resignation was given or the resignation otherwise took place or (ii) the Agent was dismissed through a decision

<<<

 by the Holders, the Issuer shall appoint a successor Agent which shall be an independent financial institution or other reputable company which regularly acts as agent under debt issuances.

<<<

 of a successor, the retiring Agent shall be discharged from any further obligation in respect of the Finance Documents but shall remain entitled to the benefit of the Finance Documents and remain liable under the Finance Documents in respect

<<<

 of any action which it took or failed to take whilst acting as Agent. Its successor, the Issuer and each of the Holders shall have the same rights and obligations amongst themselves under the Finance Documents as they would have had if such

<<<

 successor had been the original Agent.
In the event that there is a change of the Agent in accordance with this Clause 20.4, the Issuer shall execute such documents and take such actions as the new Agent may reasonably require for the purpose

<<<

 of vesting in such new Agent the rights, powers and obligation of the Agent and releasing the retiring Agent from its further obligations under the Finance Documents. Unless the Issuer and the new Agent agrees otherwise, the new Agent shall

<<<

 be entitled to the same fees and the same indemnities as the retiring Agent.

The Issuer appoints the Issuing Agent to manage certain specified tasks under these Terms and Conditions and in accordance

<<<

 with the legislation, rules and regulations applicable to and/or issued by the CSD and relating to the Bonds.

 which shall replace the old Issuing Agent as issuing agent in accordance with these Terms and Conditions.
