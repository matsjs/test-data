specific Event of Default if it is no longer continuing or if it has been decided, in accordance

with these

permanently). However, if a moratorium occurs, the ending of that moratorium will not

authority, it is not necessary that the decision has become enforceable under law or that the

<<<

 for cause of termination to be deemed to exist.

14.4

The Issuer is obliged to inform the Trustee immediately if any circumstance of the type

specified in Clause 14.1 should occur. Should the Trustee not receive such information, the

such a conflict would exist pursuant to the listing contract with First North Stockholm,

Nasdaq Stockholm or otherwise, the Issuer shall however be obliged to either seek

<<<

 the

approval from First North Stockholm or Nasdaq Stockholm (or any other Regulated Market,

as applicable) or undertake other reasonable measures, including entering into a non

default and (ii) decide, within 20 Business Days of the day of notification or determination,

<<<

 Trustee has decided not to terminate the

Bonds, the Trustee shall, at the earliest possible date, notify the Holders that there exists a

right of termination and obtain instructions from the Holders according to the provisions in

Clause

<<<

 16 (Decisions by Holders). If the Holders vote in favour of termination and instruct

the Trustee to terminate the Bonds, the Trustee shall promptly declare the Bonds terminated.

However, if the cause for termination according to the Trustee

<<<

's appraisal has ceased before

the termination, the Trustee shall not terminate the Bonds. The Trustee shall in such case, at

the earliest possible date, notify the Holders that the cause for termination has ceased. The

Trustee shall always

<<<

 be entitled to take the time necessary to consider whether an occurred

event constitutes an Event of Default.

<<<

 to be at hand, unless the instructing Holders agree in writing to indemnify and hold the Trustee harmless from any loss or liability and, if requested by the Trustee in its discretion, grant sufficient security for such indemnity.
If the Bonds

<<<

 are declared due and payable in accordance with the provisions in this Clause 14, the Trustee shall take every reasonable measure necessary to recover the amounts outstanding under the Bonds.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Bonds cannot be

<<<

 terminated and become due for payment prematurely according to this Clause 14 without relevant decision by the Trustee or following instructions from the Holders' pursuant to Clause 16 (Decisions by Holders).
If the Bonds are declared due and

<<<

&&& payable in accordance with this Clause 14, the Issuer shall redeem all Bonds with an amount per Bond equal to the applicable Call Option Amount for the relevant period (plus accrued and unpaid Interest) or, if the Bonds are accelerated before

(d) fourthly, in or towards payment pro rata of any other costs or outstanding amounts unpaid under the Finance Documents.
Any excess funds after the

<<<

 application of proceeds in accordance with paragraphs (a) to (d) above shall be paid to the Issuer. The application of proceeds in accordance with paragraphs

(a) to (d) above shall, however, not restrict a Holders' Meeting or a Written

<<<

 Procedure from resolving that accrued Interest (whether overdue or not) shall be reduced without a corresponding reduction of principal.

15.2

If a Holder or another party has paid any fees, costs, expenses or indemnities referred to in

Clause

<<<
