INTEREST

9.1

Other than in respect of an Interest Period for which the Cash Coupon Rate applies

(pursuant to 9.2 below), each Note carries Interest at the Interest Rate applied to the

Nominal Amount from (and including) the Issue

<<<

 Date up to (but excluding) the relevant

Redemption Date. Interest accrued pursuant to this Clause 9.1 shall be paid as payment-in

kind interest ("PIK Interest"). Any additional Notes issued to pay PIK Interest will carry

Interest at the

<<<

 Interest Rate, or the Cash Coupon Rate (as defined below), as applicable,

applied to the Nominal Amount from (and including) the date of their issuance up to (but

excluding) the relevant Redemption Date.

9.2

In the event that (i) the "leverage

<<<

 ratio" as set out in the latest compliance certificate

provided under the BidCo Facilities Agreement for most recent quarter end (as received by

the Agent in accordance with Clause 12.1.1(b)) is below 3 to 1 (proforma the cash

distribution

<<<

 referred to in 9.3 below itself), (ii) no Event of Default has occurred and is

continuing or would result from the payment of making of the cash distribution, and (iii)

no event of default has occurred and is continuing under the BidCo Facilities

<<<

 Agreement,

then the Cash Coupon Rate shall apply for the Interest Period ending on the Interest

Payment Date following the provision of the relevant compliance certificate.

In respect of any Interest Period for which the Cash Coupon

<<<

 Rate is applicable, the Issuer

shall pay at least 50 per cent., or such percentage above 50 per cent. as the Issuer shall at

its sole discretion decide, of the Interest accrued for such Interest Period in cash. The

balance of Interest accrued

<<<

 for such Interest Period not paid in cash, if any, shall be paid as

PIK Interest, provided, however, that the Cash Coupon Rate shall apply for any Interest

payable as PIK Interest under this Clause 9.3. In the event that the Cash Coupon Rate

<<<

 is

applicable pursuant to Clause 9.2, the Issuer shall notify the Agent and the Noteholders in

accordance with Clause 25.1 that the Cash Coupon Rate is applicable and of the proportion

of the Interest accrued for the relevant Interest Period

<<<

 that shall be paid in cash (as

determined above). Such notice shall be provided to the Noteholders not less than ten (10)

Business Days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date.

9.4

The Issuer shall pay any accrued PIK Interest on the

<<<

 Notes by issuing additional Notes to

the Noteholders holding Notes on the applicable Interest Payment Date. The amount of

additional Notes issued to a Noteholder holding Notes shall be calculated as the product of

(x) the aggregate amount

<<<

 of accrued PIK Interest on the Notes for the quarter ending on the

relevant Interest Payment Date and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the aggregate

amount of Notes held by that Noteholder and the denominator of which is the total

<<<



aggregate amount of the Notes, provided that the total amount of additional Notes issued to

a Noteholder shall be rounded down to the nearest SEK 1.00.
