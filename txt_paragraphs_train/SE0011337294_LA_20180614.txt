The Issuer is only obliged to inform the Trustee according to Clause 12.4 if informing the

Trustee would not conflict with any statute or the Issuer's registration contract with Nasdaq

Stockholm 

<<<

(or any other Regulated Market, as applicable). If such a conflict would exist

pursuant to the listing contract with Nasdaq Stockholm or otherwise, the Issuer shall

however be obliged to either seek the approval from Nasdaq Stockholm (or any

<<<

 other

Regulated Market, as applicable) or undertake other reasonable measures, including entering

into a non-disclosure agreement with the Trustee, in order to be able to timely inform the

Trustee according to Clause 12.4.

<<<

 to consider whether an occurred event constitutes an Event of Default.
If the Holders, without any prior initiative to decision from the Trustee or the Issuer, have made a decision regarding termination in accordance with Clause 14 (Decisions

 by Holders), the Trustee shall promptly declare the Bonds terminated. The Trustee is however not liable to take action if the Trustee considers cause for termination not to be at hand, unless the instructing Holders agree in writing to indemnify

<<<

 and hold the Trustee harmless from any loss or liability and, if requested by the Trustee in its discretion, grant sufficient security for such indemnity.
If the Bonds are declared due and payable in accordance with the provisions in this Clause

<<<

 12, the Trustee shall take every reasonable measure necessary to recover the amounts outstanding under the Bonds.

(d) fourthly

<<<

, in or towards payment pro rata of any other costs or outstanding amounts unpaid under these Terms and Conditions.

Any excess funds after the application of proceeds in accordance with items (a) to (d) above shall be paid to the Issuer. The

<<<

 reduction of principal.

13.2

If a Holder or another party has paid any fees, costs, expenses or indemnities referred to in

Clause 13.1, such Holder or other party shall be entitled to reimbursement by way of a

corresponding distribution

<<<

 in accordance with Clause 13.1.

13.3
