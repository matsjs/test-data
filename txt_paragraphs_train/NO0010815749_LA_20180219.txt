<<<

 be subject to the Finance Documents and by acquiring Bonds, each subsequent Bondholder confirms such agreement.

<<<

 Initial Bonds is NOK 250,000,000. All Initial Bonds are issued on a fully paid basis at an issue price of 100 per cent. of the Initial Nominal Amount. The minimum permissible subscription amount upon the issuance of the Bonds is NOK 1,250,

<<<

<<<

 such breach, benefit from the rights attached to the Bonds pursuant to these Terms and Conditions (including, but not limited to, voting rights), provided that the Issuer shall not incur any additional liability by complying with its obligations

<<<

 to such Bondholder.
