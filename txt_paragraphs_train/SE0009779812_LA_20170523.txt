<<<

 is likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

12.2

The Agent may not terminate the Bonds in accordance with Clause 12.1 by reference to a

specific Event of Default if it is no longer continuing or if it has been decided, in accordance

with

<<<

 these Terms and Conditions, to waive such Event of Default (temporarily or

permanently). However, if a moratorium occurs, the ending of that moratorium will not

prevent termination for payment prematurely on the ground mentioned under

Clause

<<<

authority, it is not necessary that the decision has become enforceable under law or that the

12.4

The Issuer is obliged to inform the Agent immediately if any circumstance of the type

specified in Clause 12.1 should occur. Should the Agent not receive such information, the

provided that the Agent does not have knowledge of such circumstance. The Agent is under

no obligations to make any investigations relating to the circumstances

<<<

 specified in

Clause 12.1. The Issuer shall further, at the request of the Agent, provide the Agent with

details of any circumstances referred to in Clause 12.1 and provide the Agent with all

documents that may be of significance for the

<<<

 application of this Clause 12.

12.5

The Issuer is only obliged to inform the Agent according to Clause 12.4 if informing the

Agent would not conflict with any statute or the Issuer's registration contract with Nasdaq

Stockholm (or any other

<<<

 Regulated Market, as applicable). If such a conflict would exist

pursuant to the listing contract with Nasdaq Stockholm (or any other Regulated Market, as

applicable) or otherwise, the Issuer shall however be obliged to either seek the approval

<<<

 from

Nasdaq Stockholm (or any other Regulated Market, as applicable) or undertake other

19

12.6

<<<

 timely inform the Agent according to Clause 12.4.
If the Agent has been notified by the Issuer or has otherwise determined that there is a default under these Terms and Conditions according to Clause 12.1, the Agent shall (i) notify, within

<<<

 five (5) Business Days of the day of notification or determination, the Holders of the default and (ii) decide, within twenty (20) Business Days of the day of notification or determination, if the Bonds shall be declared terminated. If the

<<<

 Agent has decided not to terminate the Bonds, the Agent shall, at the earliest possible date, notify the Holders that there exists a right of termination and obtain instructions from the Holders according to the provisions in Clause 14 {Decisions

<<<

 by Holders). If the Holders vote in favour of termination and instruct the Agent to terminate the Bonds, the Agent shall promptly declare the Bonds terminated. However, if the cause for termination according to the Agent's appraisal has ceased

<<<

 before the termination, the Agent shall not terminate the Bonds. The Agent shall in such case, at the earliest possible date, notify the Holders that the cause for termination has ceased. The Agent shall always be entitled to take the time

<<<

 necessary to consider whether an occurred event constitutes an Event of Default.
If the Holders, without any prior initiative to decision from the Agent or the Issuer, have made a decision regarding termination in accordance with Clause 14

<<<

 {Decisions by Holders), the Agent shall promptly declare the Bonds terminated. The Agent is however not liable to take action if the Agent considers cause for termination not to be at hand, unless the instructing Holders agree in writing to

<<<

 indemnify and hold the Agent harmless from any loss or liability and, if requested by the Agent in its discretion, grant sufficient security for such indemnity.
If the Bonds are declared due and payable in accordance with the provisions in

<<<

 this Clause 12, the Agent shall take every reasonable measure necessary to recover the amounts outstanding under the Bonds.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Bonds cannot be terminated and become due for payment prematurely according to this

<<<

 Clause 12 without relevant decision by the Agent or following instructions from the Holders' pursuant to Clause 14 {Decisions by Holders).
If the Bonds are declared due and payable in accordance with this Clause 12, the Issuer shall redeem

<<<

&&& all Bonds with an amount per Bond equal to the applicable Call Option Price, together with accrued but unpaid Interest.

(c) thirdly, in or towards payment pro rata of any unpaid principal under the Bonds; and

(d) fourthly, in or towards payment pro

<<<

 rata of any other costs or outstanding amounts unpaid under these Terms and Conditions.

Any excess funds after the application of proceeds in accordance with paragraphs (a) to (d) above shall be paid to the Issuer. The application of proceeds

<<<

 in accordance with paragraphs (a) to (d) above shall, however, not restrict a Holders' Meeting or a Written Procedure from resolving that accrued Interest (whether overdue or not) shall be reduced without a corresponding reduction of principal

<<<

.

13.2

If a Holder or another party has paid any fees, costs, expenses or indemnities referred to in

Clause 13.1, such Holder or other party shall be entitled to reimbursement by way of a

corresponding distribution in accordance with Clause

<<<

 13.1.

13.3

the Bonds constitute escrow funds according to the Escrow Funds Act and must be held on a

. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for any Interest due

but unpaid the Record Date specified in Clause 8.1 shall apply.
