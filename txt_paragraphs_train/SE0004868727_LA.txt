<<<

 by these Terms and Conditions);
(h) in respect of a merger with another company than a Group Company, decision is made that the Company shall be merged into another company, unless the Agent, upon the Company's written assurance that the merger

 will not affect the Bonds negatively, has given its consent in writing prior to the merger (where consent is not to be understood as a waiver of the rights that applicable law at the time assigns the concerned creditors); or
(i) in respect

adversely and materially affect the Bondholders' interests and that the cause of

termination is continuing at the time of the Agent's declaration.

11.4

The Company is obliged to inform the Agent immediately of any

<<<

 circumstance of the

type specified in Condition 11.1 upon gaining knowledge of such event or circumstance

For the avoidance of doubt, the Bonds cannot be accelerated

Bondholders. Bonds held by the Company, a Group Company

<<<

 or by a direct or indirect

shareholder of the Company shall not be entitled to any voting right and shall not be

considered when calculating whether necessary majority has been achieved in

accordance with these Terms and Conditions. The

<<<

 resolution of the Bondholders shall

be the opinion represented by the majority of the votes cast or the answers received (as

applicable) ("Majority"). In respect of the below issues the following qualified

majority is required among the

<<<

 votes cast or the answers received (as applicable) in

order to deem a resolution passed ("Qualified Majority"):

<<<

 of the meeting (or, in case of a procedure in writing, the Agent) will prevail.

12.4

Quorum exists only where (i) Bondholders representing at least one fifth (1/5) of the

Adjusted Nominal Amount attend the meeting in due order (or, in case

<<<

 of a procedure in

writing, provide answers), or (ii) where any decision requiring a Qualified Majority is at

issue, Bondholders representing at least one-half of the Adjusted Nominal Amount

attend the meeting (or, in the case of a procedure

<<<

 in writing, provide answers). If

quorum is not achieved within fifteen (15) minutes from the fixed time (or, in case of a

procedure in writing, through received answers at the end of the time for replies), the

meeting shall be adjourned

<<<

 (or, in case of a procedure in writing, the time for replies

shall be extended) to the day which falls on the fifth (5th) Business Day thereafter.

Notice containing information regarding time and place for a continued meeting (or, in

case

<<<

 of a procedure in writing, information regarding extended time for replies) shall
