<<<

-exclusive personal jurisdiction of such courts.
(c) Appropriate Forum: The Issuer irrevocably waives any objection which it might now or hereafter have to the courts referred to in Condition 18(b) (Jurisdiction o f New York Courts) being nominated

<<<

 as the forum to hear and determine any Proceedings, and agrees not to claim that any such court is not a convenient or appropriate forum.
(d) Process Agent: The Issuer has appointed CT Corporation System at 111 Eighth Avenue, New York, NY 

<<<

10011, United States (or, if different, its principal place of business in the City of New York for the time being) as its authorized agent upon whom process may be served in any Proceedings in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York

<<<

 of the Fiscal Agent, appoint a further person in The City of New York to accept service of process on its behalf and, failing such appointment within 15 days, any Noteholder shall be entitled to appoint such a person by written notice addressed

<<<

<<<

) on the business day immediately following the day on which such person receives such payment. If the amount in U.S. dollars that may be so purchased for any reason falls short of the amount originally due, the Issuer shall pay such additional

 of any Noteholder to take Proceedings in any other court of competent jurisdiction, nor shall the taking of Proceedings in any one or more jurisdictions preclude the taking of Proceedings in any other jurisdiction (whether concurrently or not

<<<

) if and to the extent permitted by law. (g) Waiver o f Immunity: To the extent that the Issuer may in any jurisdiction claim for itself or its assets or revenues immunity from suit, execution, attachment (whether in aid of execution, before

<<<

 judgment or otherwise) or other legal process and to the extent that such immunity (whether or not claimed) may be attributed in any such jurisdiction to the Issuer or its assets or revenues, the Issuer agrees not to claim and irrevocably waives

<<<

 such immunity to the full extent permitted by the laws of such jurisdiction and, in particular, to the intent that in any proceedings taken in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York the foregoing waiver of immunity shall have the

<<<

 fullest scope permitted under the United States Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 and is intended to be irrevocable for the purposes of such act.
