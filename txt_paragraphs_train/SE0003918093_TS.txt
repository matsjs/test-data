<<<

 in Cash and Cash Equivalents (or other collateral of the Company to the Agent's satisfaction, acting reasonably) is provided (to the satisfaction of the Agent, acting reasonably) in respect of the Company 's proper discharge of its obligations

<<<

 under the Bonds amounting to no less than the aggregate outstanding amount of the Bonds including 3 months' accrued interest. From the date of notification from the Company that the relevant event under Clause 11.1.211.1.8 is no longer continuing

<<<

, the Agent shall, within three (3) Banking Days, release the said collateral to the Company.
11.3 The Company is obliged to inform the Agent immediately if any circumstance of the type specified in Clause 11.1 occurs. Should the Agent not receive

 on a Holders' Meeting to terminate the Bonds, or if such termination is demanded by Holders holding Bonds representing at least one half of the Adjusted Nominal Amount, the Agent shall promptly declare the Bonds terminated. If the relevant

<<<

 Event of Default according to the Agent's appraisal has ceased before the declaration of termination, the Agent is not liable to execute it. The Agent shall in such case, at the earliest possible date, notify the Holders that the relevant Event

<<<

 of Default has ceased to exist. If the Holders, without prior solicitation from the Agent or the Company, have passed a resolution in accordance with all relevant provisions in Clause 12 (Holders'Meeting) and to the effect that the Bonds shall

<<<

 be terminated in accordance with all relevant provisions of this Clause 11, the Agent shall promptly execute such request accordingly. The Agent is, however, not obliged to take action if the Agent considers (acting reasonably) that an Event

<<<

1) of the aggregate Nominal Amount of the Bonds held. A Holder must vote in the same manner for all Bonds held. However, a representative which represents different Holders may vote differently for different Holders. Bonds held by any Group

<<<

 company shall not entitle any voting right and shall not be considered when calculating if necessary majority has been achieved in accordance with these Terms and Conditions. The resolution of the Holders shall be the opinion which represents

<<<

 the majority of the Adjusted Nominal Amount for the Bonds represented at the meeting. In respect of the issues below the following qualified majority is required among the votes cast and the answers received in order for a resolution to be

<<<

 validly passed ("Qualified Majority"):
(a) two thirds when (1) one of the conditions in Clause 10 is waived or (2) a condition in Clauses 10 and 11 is amended, subject to (b) below;
(b) three quarters when (1) the principal amount, interest

<<<

 of the aggregate outstanding Adjusted Nominal Amount attend the meeting (or, in the case of a procedure in writing, provide replies), or (ii) where any decision requiring a Qualified Majority is at issue, Holders representing at least one-half

<<<

 of the aggregate outstanding Adjusted Nominal Amount attend the meeting (or, in the case of a procedure in writing, provide answers). If a quorum is not achieved within fifteen (15) minutes from the fixed time (or, in the case of a procedure

<<<

 in writing, through received answers at the end of the time for replies), the meeting shall be adjourned (or, in the case of a procedure in writing, the time for replies shall be extended) to the tenth Banking Day thereafter. Notice containing

<<<

 information regarding time and place for a continued meeting (or, in the case of a procedure in writing, information regarding extended time for replies) shall promptly be provided to the Holders in accordance with Clause 15 (Notices). At a

<<<

 continued meeting (or, in the case of a procedure in writing, at a new calculation) a resolution can be passed through an ordinary resolution (or, if required in

LONDON 3718328 (2K)

15

accordance with Clause 12.3 above, through Qualified

<<<

 Majority) by Holders entitled to vote irrespective of the share of Bonds represented.
12.5 The Company, the Holders and the Agent may attend the meeting along with their respective representatives, counsels and assistants. The meeting can decide

<<<

 that further individuals may attend. The meeting is opened by an attendee appointed by the Company (or, if such person has not been appointed, a present person appointed by the Agent) and the meeting shall be chaired by such person until present

<<<

 and represented Holders have appointed a chairman for the meeting. The chairman shall arrange for minutes to be kept with respect to the meeting in which Holders entitled to vote and other persons attending the meeting shall be listed. The

<<<

<<<

 in writing, the Agent shall calculate the votes cast and prepare the minutes in respect of the calculation. The Agent may request for further information and clarifications but is not obliged to do so and may disregard unclear or illegible

<<<

 answers. The Agent shall disregard answers which do not follow listed alternatives or answers where voting rights do not appear in the material provided by the Holder or the CSD. The Company may attend the calculation. The minutes shall be

<<<

 completed promptly and be held available for the Holders at the Company and the Agent.
12.6 If the Company and the Agent deem it appropriate, a meeting may be combined with a possibility for Holders to provide answers in accordance with a written

<<<

 resolution form as an alternative to being present or being represented at a meeting.
12.7 A resolution that has been passed at a duly convened and held meeting, or a procedure in writing, is binding to all Holders irrespective of them being

<<<

 present or being represented at the meeting, or if they have participated in the procedure in writing and irrespective of how and if they have voted.

<<<

 investigation of all risks arising under or in connection with these Terms and Conditions.

<<<

 expenses are reasonable and proper. If the Agent, based on good reasons, believes that the Company is or will become insolvent the Agent is entitled to reserve reasonable remuneration from Holders for its continued work in accordance with these

<<<

 Terms and Conditions, save that the Agent shall make the arrangements stated in Clause 11.5 without having received remuneration or being indemnified by the Holders. If the Agent notifies the Holders that it will not take further actions, each

<<<

 Holder may independently represent its holding of Bonds in relation to the Company without having to observe the provisions in Clauses 11 (Acceleration, o f the Bonds) and Clause 13.5.
