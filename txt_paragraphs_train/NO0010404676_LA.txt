<<<

 send a notice regarding the recalculated amount to the Borrower and the Loan Trustee.
A. If the Borrower effects a bonus issue of shares, Conversion requested on a date that does not permit it to be effected prior to or on the tenth calendar

<<<

 day preceding the General Meeting of Shareholders held to approve the issue will not be effected until after the Meeting has approved the issue. Shares issued upon Conversions effected following approval of the bonus issue shall be entered

<<<

 in the account on an interim basis and shall not be entitled to participate in the issue. Final registration of such shares in the securities account takes place after the record date for the bonus issue.
In connection with Conversions effected

<<<

 following approval of the bonus issue, an adjusted Conversion Price shall be applicable. The adjustment is made by the Conversion Agent in accordance with the following formula:
adjusted Conversion Price = previous Conversion Price x number

<<<

 of shares prior to bonus
___________________________ issue__________________________ number of shares following the bonus issue
The adjusted Conversion Price as calculated above shall be determined by the Conversion Agent as soon as possible

<<<

 after the resolution of the General Meeting of Shareholders regarding the bonus issue, but not applicable to Conversions effected until after the record date for the bonus issue.
B. If the Borrower effects a consolidation or a split of its

<<<

 shares, sub-section A above shall apply correspondingly, in which case the record date shall be considered to be the date upon which such consolidation or split is registered at the VPC at the request of the Borrower.
C. If the Borrower issues

<<<

 new shares - with preferential rights to its shareholders to subscribe for new shares for cash or offset against a claim - the following shall apply with respect to the rights to participate in the new issue that accrue to shares arising from

<<<

 the Conversion:
1. If the new issue is resolved by the Board of Directors subject to the approval of the General Meeting of Shareholders or as authorized by the Meeting, the Board's resolution and the announcement of the new issue shall specify

<<<

 the latest date when Conversion shall have to have been effected in order for shares issued upon Conversion to have rights to participate in the new issue. Such date may not be earlier than the tenth calendar day following the date of the notice

<<<

.

2. If the new issue is to be approved by the General Meeting of Shareholders, Conversion - requested on a date such that Conversion cannot be effected at the latest on the tenth calendar day prior to the date of the General Meeting of Shareholders

<<<

 that approves the new issue - will not be effected until the Conversion Agent has set the adjusted Conversion Price in accordance with the second last paragraph of this sub-section C. Shares issued upon such Conversions will be entered in the

<<<

 securities account on an interim basis, and shall not entitle the Bondholders to participate in the new issue.

In connection with Conversions effected on a date such that rights to participate in the new issue do not accrue, an adjusted Conversion

<<<

 Price shall be applied. The adjustment shall be made by the Conversion Agent in accordance with the following formula:

adjusted Conversion
Price =

previous Conversion Price x the average market price of the shares during the subscription

<<<

 period specified in the resolution authorizing the issue (the average share price)
average share price increased by the theoretical value of the subscription right based on such price

The average price of the share shall be considered to correspond

<<<

 to the average of the mean of the highest and lowest prices paid each trading day in transactions as recorded in the Market Place's official list of prices during the subscription period. In the absence of a quotation of paid price, the last

<<<

 bid price quoted shall be used in the calculation. If neither a paid price nor a bid price is quoted on a given day, that day shall be excluded from calculation of the average share price.

The theoretical value of subscription rights is calculated

<<<

 in accordance with the following formula:

value of

maximum number of new shares that

subscription can be issued according to the resolution

rights=

approving the new issue x (average

share price minus the price at which the

________

<<<

_______ new shares are being issued)__________

number of shares outstanding prior to

the resolution authorizing new shares

If this calculation produces a negative value, the theoretical value of the subscription rights shall be fixed at zero

<<<

.

The adjusted Conversion Price calculated and described above shall be set by the Conversion Agent two (2) Business Days following the expiration of the subscription period and shall be applied in any Conversion effected thereafter.

During

<<<

 the period until the adjusted Conversion Price is set, only a preliminary Conversion shall be effected, in connection with which the number of full shares according to the as yet unadjusted Conversion Price shall be recorded in the securities

<<<

 account on an interim basis. In addition, a special note shall be made to the effect that the convertible claim according to the adjusted Conversion Price can carry the right to further shares. Final registration in the securities account shall

<<<

 occur after the adjusted Conversion Price has been established.

D. If the Borrower effects - with preferential rights for the shareholders and in return for cash payment or offset against a claim - an issue as referred to in Chapter 14 or

<<<

 15 of the Swedish Companies Act, the provision in sub-section C, first paragraph, 1 and 2, shall apply correspondingly to the right of shares issued upon Conversion to participate in such issue.
In connection with Conversion effected on a date

 such that rights to participate in the issue do not accrue, an adjusted Conversion Price shall apply. The adjustment shall be made by the Conversion Agent in accordance with the following formula:

 day in transactions as recorded in the Market Place's official list of prices during the

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA

subscription period. In the absence of a quotation of a paid price, the last bid price quoted shall be included in the calculation

<<<

. If neither a paid price nor a bid price is quoted on a given day, that day shall be excluded from calculation of the value of subscription rights.

The adjusted Conversion Price calculated and described above shall be set by the Bank two 

<<<

(2) Business Days following expiry of the subscription period and shall be applied in connection with Conversions effected thereafter.

In connection with a Conversion effected during the period until the adjusted Conversion Price is set, the

<<<

 rules stated in sub-section C, in the last paragraph, shall apply correspondingly.

E. Should the Borrower, in cases other than those set forth in sub-sections A through D above, make an offer to its shareholders to acquire on a preferential

<<<

 basis securities or rights of any type from the Borrower in accordance with the principles stated in Chapter 13, Section 1 of the Swedish Companies Act or decide to distribute, in accordance with the above mentioned principles, such securities

<<<

 or rights to shareholders without consideration ("the offer"), an adjusted Conversion Price shall be applied in connection with Conversions requested at any time such that the shares received do not carry rights to participate in the offer

 or distribution. The adjustment shall be made by the Conversion Agent in accordance with the following formula:

.
In the event that shareholders receive purchase rights and if trading of such rights has taken place, the value of the right to participate in the offer shall be considered to correspond to the value of the purchase right. The value of the

<<<

 purchase right shall be considered to correspond to the average of the mean of the highest and lowest prices paid for such rights on each trading day in transactions as recorded in the the Market Place's official list of prices during the subscription

<<<

 period. In the absence of a quotation of a paid price, the last bid price quoted shall be included in the calculation. If neither a paid price nor a bid price is quoted on a given day, that day shall be excluded from the calculation of the

<<<

 value of the purchase rights.
In the event that shareholders have not received purchase rights or else such trading in purchase rights as referred to in the preceding paragraph has not taken place, the adjustment of the Conversion Price shall

<<<

 be calculated by applying as far as possible the principles set forth above in sub-section E herein, whereby the following shall apply. If there is a market listing of the securities or rights offered to shareholders, the value of the right

<<<

 to participate in the offer shall be considered to correspond to the average of the prices paid for such a security or right on each trading day for a period

18

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA

of twenty-five (25) trading days from and including the

<<<

 first day for listing calculated as the mean of the highest and lowest paid prices recorded for transactions in these securities or rights on the Market Place, less any consideration that is paid for these in conjunction with the offer. In

<<<

 the absence of a quotation of a paid price, the last bid price quoted shall be included in the calculation. If neither a paid price nor a bid price is quoted on a given day, that day shall be excluded from the calculation of the value of the

<<<

 purchase rights. When calculating the adjustment of the Conversion Price in accordance with this paragraph, the said period of twenty-five (25) trading days shall be deemed to correspond to the application period specified in the offer referred

<<<

 to in the first paragraph in this sub-section E above.

Should such listing not take place, the value of the right to participate in the offer shall be determined as far as possible on the basis of the change in the market price of the Borrower

<<<

's shares that can be considered to have arisen as a consequence of the offer.

The Conversion Price adjusted in the manner described above shall be set by the Bank at the earliest opportunity after it has been possible to calculate the value

<<<

 of the right to participate in the offer, and shall be applied in Conversions effected after the adjusted price has been set.

In connection with Conversions effected during the period until the adjusted Conversion Price has been set, the rules

<<<

 stated in sub-section C, last paragraph above, shall apply correspondingly.

F. If it is decided to pay a cash dividend to shareholders, an adjusted Conversion Price shall be applied, for Conversions requested at such a time such that Shares

<<<

 thereby received do not carry rights to the receipt of such dividend. The adjustment shall be made by the Conversion Agent in accordance with the following formula:

adjusted Conversion Price =

previous Conversion Price x the average market

<<<

 price of the Shares during a period of 25 trading days calculated from and including the day the Shares are listed ex rights to the dividend (average share price)

average share price increased by the dividend paid per Share

The average price

<<<

 of the Share shall be considered to correspond to the average of the mean of the highest and lowest prices paid each trading day during the above stated period of twenty-five (25) trading days in accordance with the official price list of the

<<<

 Market Place. In the absence of a quotation of a paid price, the last bid price quoted shall be used in the calculation. If neither a paid price nor a bid price is quoted on a given day, that day shall be excluded from the calculation.
The

<<<

 adjusted Conversion Price calculated and described above shall be set by the Bank two (2) Business Days after the close of such period of twenty-five (25) trading days beginning on the date when the shares were listed ex-rights to the dividend

<<<

 and shall be applied in Conversions effected thereafter.

19

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA

If Conversion has been requested but, due to the provisions in Clause 13 above, final registration in the securities account has not been completed, it shall

<<<

 be specially noted that the Convertible claim according to the adjusted Conversion Price can carry the right to further shares. Final registration in the share account shall occur after the adjusted Conversion Price has been established, but

<<<

 not earlier than at the time set forth in Clause 13 above.

G. If the Borrower's share capital should be reduced through a repayment to its shareholders, and the reduction is compulsory, an adjusted Conversion Price shall be applied. The adjustment

<<<

 shall be made by the Conversion Agent in accordance with the following formula:

adjusted Conversion Price =

previous Conversion Price x average market price of the Shares during a period of 25 trading days beginning on the date when the shares

<<<

 were quoted without repayment rights (average share price)
average share price increased by the amount being repaid per Share

The average share price shall be calculated as stated in sub-section C above.

When making adjustment in accordance

<<<

 with the above, where the reduction is carried out through a redemption of shares, instead of using the actual amount which is repaid for each Share, an amount calculated as follows shall be applied:

calculated amount to be repaid for each

<<<

 share =

the actual amount repaid for each redeemed Share reduced by the average market price of the Shares during a period of 25 trading days immediately prior to the day on which the Shares were quoted without rights to participate in the

<<<

 reduction (average share price)
the number of shares of the Company which underlie the redemption of one Share reduced by 1

The average share price shall be calculated as stated in sub-section C above.

The adjusted Conversion Price calculated

<<<

 and described above shall be set by the Conversion Agent two (2) Business Days following the expiry of the stated period of twenty-five (25) trading days and shall be applied in connection with Conversions effected thereafter.

In connection

<<<

 with a Conversion effected during the period until the adjusted Conversion Price is set, the rules stated in sub-section C, last paragraph, shall apply correspondingly.

If the Borrower's share capital should be reduced through a redemption

<<<

 of Shares with repayment to the shareholders, and the reduction is not compulsory, but, where, in the

20

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA
Loan Trustee's opinion, in view of its technical structure and financial effects, the reduction is equivalent

<<<

 to a reduction which is compulsory, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted by applying, to the greatest extent possible, the rules stated in this sub section G.
H. If it is decided that the Borrower shall acquire its own Shares in accordance

<<<

 with Chapter 19, Section 13 of the Swedish Companies Act, where the acquisition, in the Loan Trustee's opinion, in view of its technical structure and financial effects, is equivalent to a compulsory reduction of the Company's share capital

<<<

, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted by applying, to the greatest extent possible, the rules stated in sub-section G above.
I. If changes are made in the share capital other than those mentioned in sub-sections A through H above, which are

<<<

 unfavourable to the Bondholders compared to the shareholders, the Loan Trustee and the Borrower shall agree on a new Conversion Price. This also applies to other transactions, which are unfavourable to the Bondholders. The principles expressed

<<<

 in sub-sections A through H above shall always be the basis for any adjustments pursuant to this sub-section I.
J. In adjusting the Conversion Price as described above, the price shall be rounded to four (4) decimals.
K. If it is decided that

<<<

 the Borrower is to enter into liquidation, pursuant to Chapter 25 of the Swedish Companies Act, Conversion may not be requested thereafter, regardless of the grounds for liquidation. The right to request Conversion ceases simultaneously with

<<<

 the decision to liquidate, notwithstanding the fact that the decision may not have come into legal force. However, Bondholders have the right, in such cases, to demand immediate payment of the principal amount of their Bonds plus accrued interest

<<<

 to the date of payment. If the decision to liquidate is made at a General Meeting of Shareholders, this right becomes effective on the day following the Meeting or else on the day following the date on which the court order or liquidation has

<<<

 come into legal force. Within a week thereafter, the Borrower shall notify the Bondholders in writing, reminding them of their right to demand immediate payment.
Not later than two (2) months before the General Meeting of Shareholders determines

<<<

 whether the Borrower should enter into voluntary liquidation, as provided in Chapter 25, Section 1 of the Swedish Companies Act, the Bondholders shall be informed of the planned liquidation. The notice shall include a reminder that Conversion

<<<

 may not be requested after the Meeting has voted to liquidate.
If the Borrower gives notice of planned liquidation as stated above, Bondholders are entitled - notwithstanding the provisions of Section 13 above regarding the earliest time for

<<<

 requesting Conversion - to request Conversion from the date when the notice was issued, provided that Conversion can be effected not later than the tenth calendar day prior to the General Meeting of Shareholders at which the issue of the Borrower

<<<

's liquidation is to be considered.
L. If the General Meeting of Shareholders approves a merger agreement, in accordance with Chapter 23, Section 15 of the Swedish Companies Act, whereby the Borrower would become part of another company, Conversion

<<<

 may not thereafter be requested.
21

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA
However, the Bondholders have the right, during a period of two (2) months from the date of such approval, to demand immediate payment of the principal amount of their Bonds, plus

<<<

 interest accrued to the date of payment.
The Borrower shall notify the Bondholders, advising them of this right, not later than one (1) week following the beginning of such period. Nothing contained herein shall impair rights that may legally

<<<

 accrue to the Bondholders in their capacity as creditors in conjunction with a merger.
Not later than two (2) months prior to the time the Borrower takes a final decision on the matter of a merger as described above, the Bondholders shall be

<<<

 informed of such merger plans. The notice shall present a report on the principal terms of the planned merger agreement and shall remind the Bondholders that Conversion may not be requested once the merger has been fully approved in accordance

<<<

 with that stated in the first paragraph above.
Should the Borrower give notice of the planned merger as stated above, the Bondholders shall - notwithstanding the provisions of Section 13 above regarding the earliest time for requesting Conversion

<<<

 - have the right to request Conversion from the date when the notice of the merger plans was issued, provided that Conversion can be effected not later than the tenth calendar day prior to the General Meeting of Shareholders at which the merger

<<<

 agreement, whereby the Borrower shall become part of another company, is to be approved.
M. Should the Board of Directors, in accordance with Chapter 23, Section 6 of the Swedish Companies Act, conclude a merger agreement, the following shall

<<<

 apply.
If a Swedish limited liability stock company owns all shares outstanding in the Borrower, and the Board of Directors announces its intention of concluding a merger agreement in accordance with the stipulations in the Act cited in the

<<<

 preceding paragraph, the Borrower shall in the event that the final day for Conversion pursuant to Section 13 above occurs after such announcement, determine a new final day for requests for Conversion ("closing date"). The closing date shall

<<<

 fall within sixty (60) days from the date of the announcement.
If public notice has been given in accordance with that stated above in this sub section, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 13 above with respect to the earliest date to

<<<

 request Conversion, the Bondholders shall have the right to request Conversion up to and including the closing date. At least four (4) weeks prior to the closing date, the Borrower shall remind the Bondholders of this right and also remind

<<<

 them that Conversion may not be requested after the closing date. In addition, the Bondholders shall be reminded in this notification of their right to demand immediate payment in accordance with that stated in the preceding paragraph.
N. Notwithstanding

<<<

 the provisions of sub-sections K, L and M above to the effect that Conversion may not be requested after a decision is made to liquidate, or approval is given for a merger agreement or after the expiry of a new closing date upon merger, rights

<<<

 to request Conversion shall be reinstated in the event that the liquidation is revoked or the agreement to merge is not implemented.
22

Norsk Tillitsmann ASA
O. In the event of the Borrower going into bankruptcy, Conversion may not be requested

<<<

 from that point onwards. If, however, the bankruptcy decision is revoked by a higher court of law, Conversion may again be requested.
14.2 The Borrower undertakes to consult with the Loan Trustee well in advance before the Company takes such

<<<

 measures as are described in Clause 14.1 above.
The Borrower further undertakes not to take any measures described in Clause 14.1 above, if they would result in a recalculation of the Conversion Price to an amount less than the quota value

<<<

 of one Share in the Borrower.
14.3 If the application of the terms and conditions contained in Clause 14.1 A - O leads to a result that is less favourable to the Bondholders than what is customary in the Norwegian bond market then the Board

<<<

 of Directors of the Borrower shall agree with the Loan Trustee on such changes in the application thereof as may be necessary to reach a result that is in line with the application of corresponding adjustment clauses in the Norwegian bond market

<<<

, even if this results in a higher amount of Shares to be issued.
