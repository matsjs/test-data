DESCRIPTION OF NOTES
You will find definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this Description of Notes under the heading "Certain Definitions''. For purposes of this Description of Notes, references to the "Issuer'', "we", ``our'', and

<<<

 ``us'' refer only to NorCell Sweden Holding 3 AB (publ) and not to any of its subsidiaries.
The Issuer will issue SEK 3,492,306,000 aggregate principal amount of 91/4% Senior Secured Notes due 2018 (the ``Notes'') under an indenture to be dated

<<<

 as of November 2, 2011 (the ``Indenture''), between, inter alios, itself, Deutsche Trustee Company Limited, as trustee (the ``Trustee'') and Nordea Bank AB (publ), as security agent, in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration

<<<

 requirements of the Securities Act.
In connection with the Acquisition (as defined below), the Issuer entered into a SEK 3,492 million senior secured bridge facilities agreement (the ``Senior Secured Bridge Facilities Agreement''), dated July

<<<

 21, 2011, as amended and restated on August 3, 2011 and September 26, 2011 and further amended on October 24, 2011, between, the Issuer, NorCell Sweden Holding 2 AB (publ) (``HoldCo''), Goldman Sachs Bank USA, Nordea Bank AB (publ), Banc of

<<<

 America Securities Limited, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, UBS Limited and Morgan Stanley Bank International Limited as mandated lead arrangers and bookrunners, and Nordea Bank AB (publ) as agent and security agent. The proceeds of the loans

<<<

 under the Senior Secured Bridge Facilities Agreement, together with funds drawn under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, proceeds of the loans under the Senior Bridge Facility and a subordinated intercompany loan from the direct parent of

<<<

 HoldCo (``MidCo'') (which was financed by a drawing by MidCo under the PIK Bridge Facilities), and capital contributions and Subordinated Shareholder Funding, were used by the Issuer to acquire (the ``Acquisition'') all the Capital Stock in

<<<

 the Company, to repay certain existing indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries and to pay certain costs and expenses. The proceeds of the offering of the Notes sold on the Issue Date, together with cash on hand, will be used by the

<<<

 Issuer to repay the loans under the Senior Secured Bridge Facilities Agreement and to cover certain costs and expenses as set forth in this Offering Memorandum under the caption ``Use of Proceeds''.
Upon the initial issuance of the Notes, the

<<<

 Notes will be obligations solely of the Issuer and will be guaranteed only by HoldCo but not by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Issuer shall procure (i) that the security granted by the

<<<

 Company and its subsidiaries as security for obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities also secures the obligations under the Notes on a senior basis and (ii) that the Notes are guaranteed by the Company and its Subsidiaries by

<<<

 executing a supplemental indenture, in each case, during the period between 45 days and 60 days after the Completion Date (the ``Post-Completion Period'').
The Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount and SEK 3,492,306,000

<<<

 in principal amount of Notes will be issued in this offering. We may issue an unlimited principal amount of additional Notes at later dates under the same Indenture (the ``Additional Notes''); provided, however, that we will only be permitted

<<<

 to issue Additional Notes in compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture, including the covenant restricting the Incurrence of Indebtedness (as described below under ``-- Certain Covenants-- Limitation on Indebtedness'') and Limitation

<<<

 on Liens (as described below under ``-- Certain Covenants-- Limitation on Liens''). The Notes issued in this offering and, if issued, any Additional Notes will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without

<<<

 limitation, with respect to waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. Unless the context otherwise requires, in this ``Description of Notes'', references to the ``Notes'' include the Notes and any Additional Notes that are actually

<<<

 issued. The terms of the Notes include those set forth in the Indenture. The Indenture will not incorporate or include any of the provisions of the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.
This ``Description of Notes'' is intended to be

<<<

 an overview of the material provisions of the Notes and the Indenture, and refers to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents (as defined below). It does not restate those agreements in their entirety. Since this description of

<<<

 the terms of the Notes is only a summary, you should refer to the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents for complete descriptions of the obligations of the Issuer and your rights because they, and not this summary

<<<

, define your rights as holders of the Notes. Copies of the Indenture, the form of Notes, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement are available as set forth under ``Available Information''. See the section entitled ``Description

<<<

 of Certain Financing Arrangements-- Intercreditor Agreement'' for a summary of certain material terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.
164

The registered holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered

<<<

 holders will have rights under the Indenture.
General
The Notes
The Notes will, upon issuance:

The Guarantees
On the Issue Date, the Notes will be Guaranteed by HoldCo

<<<

 (the ``Parent Guarantor''). During the Post-Completion Period, the Issuer shall procure that the Notes, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, are Guaranteed by each of the Subsidiaries of the Issuer that Guarantees the Senior Secured Credit

<<<

 Facilities. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, such Subsidiaries represent all of the direct and indirect Subsidiaries of the Issuer.
Each Guarantee of the Notes will, upon issuance:

<<<

 Guarantor;
 rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Indebtedness of that Guarantor that is not subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantor's Guarantee;

 Sweden under its Guarantee of the Notes and the security provided as security for the obligations under the Notes by a company incorporated in Sweden will be limited if required by an application of the provisions of the Swedish Companies Act

<<<

 (Sw. aktiebolagslagen) regulating transfers of values (Sw. vardeOverforingar). The liability of each such Guarantor in respect of such obligations will only apply to the extent permitted by such provisions of the Swedish Companies Act.
Further

<<<

, the obligations of a Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the relevant Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law, or otherwise to reflect limitations under applicable law or capital

<<<

 maintenance regulations. See ``Risk Factors-- Risks Related to Our Structure--The Notes Guarantees and security interest will be subject to certain
165

limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain

<<<

 defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability''.

<<<

 S.A./N.V. (``Euroclear'') and Clearstream Banking, societe anonyme (``Clearstream''). If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a Business Day at the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will

<<<

 not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.
Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes
Principal

, interest and premium, if any, on the Global Notes (as defined below) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents; provided that all such payments with respect to Notes represented by one or more Global Notes

Paying Agent and Registrar for

<<<

 the Notes
The Issuer will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Notes in each of (i) London, United Kingdom (the ``Principal Paying Agent'') and (ii) Luxembourg for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg

<<<

 Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF Market (but only if the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require). The Issuer will also undertake to maintain a Paying Agent in a European Union member state that will not be

<<<

 obliged to withhold or deduct tax pursuant to the European Union Directive 2003/48/EC or any other directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN meeting of 26 and 27 November 2000 regarding the taxation of savings income (the ``Directive

<<<

''), or any law implementing or complying with or introduced in order to conform to such Directive. The initial Paying Agents will be Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch and Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. in Luxembourg.
The Issuer will also maintain

<<<

 one or more registrars (each, a ``Registrar'') with offices in Luxembourg. The initial Registrar will be Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. in Luxembourg. The Issuer will also maintain a transfer agent. The initial transfer agent will be Deutsche

<<<

 Bank Luxembourg S.A. The Registrar and the transfer agent will maintain a register reflecting ownership of Definitive Registered Notes (as defined herein) outstanding from time to time, if any, and will make payments on and facilitate transfers

<<<

 of
166

Definitive Registered Notes on behalf of the Issuer. Each transfer agent shall perform the functions of a transfer agent.
The Issuer may change any Paying Agents, Registrars or transfer agents for the Notes without prior notice to

<<<

 the Holders of such Notes. However, for so long as Notes are listed on the Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish a notice of any change of Paying

<<<

 Agent, Registrar or transfer agent in a newspaper having a general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such notice on the official website

<<<

 of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu). The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of the Notes.
Releases of the Guarantees
The Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate:
 upon a sale or other

<<<

 disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the Capital Stock of the relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding company) or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor

<<<

 (other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the ``Asset Sales'' provisions of the Indenture (as those provisions may be amended from time to time);
 upon the designation in accordance with the Indenture of

<<<

 the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;
 upon defeasance or discharge of the Notes, as provided in ``-- Defeasance'' and ``-- Satisfaction and D ischarge'' ;
 in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor

<<<

 Agreement;
 as described under ``--Amendments and Waivers'';
 with respect to a Guarantor that is not a Significant Subsidiary, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to the extent that such Guarantor (i) is unconditionally

<<<

 released and discharged from its liability with respect to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Senior Bridge Facility (and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof) and (ii) does not guarantee any other Credit Facility;
 as

<<<

 described in the fourth paragraph of the covenant described below under ``--Certain Covenants-- Limitation on Indebtedness''; or
 with respect to any Guarantor who is not the continuing or surviving Person in the relevant consolidation or

<<<

 merger, as a result of a transaction permitted by ``-- Merger and Consolidation--The Guarantors''.
The Trustee and the Security Agent (as applicable) shall each take all necessary actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under

<<<

 the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth above

<<<

 shall be effective without the consent of the Holders or any action on the part of the Trustee. Neither the Trustee nor the Issuer will be required to make a notation on the Notes to reflect any such release, termination or discharge.
Transfer

<<<

 and Exchange
The Notes will be issued in the form of one or more registered notes in global form without interest coupons attached, as follows:
 Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under

<<<

 the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the ``144A Global Notes''). The 144A Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in

<<<

 the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.
 Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes

<<<

 in registered form without interest coupons attached (the
167

``Regulation S Global Notes'' and, together with the 144A Global Notes, the ``Global Notes''). The Regulation S Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered

<<<

 in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.
Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (``Book-Entry Interests'') will be limited to Persons that have accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream

<<<

 or Persons that may hold interests through such participants.
Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described

<<<

 more fully under ``Notice to Investors''. In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or participants in Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear and Clearstream pursuant to customary procedures and subject

<<<

 to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream and their respective participants.
Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes (the ``144A Book-Entry Interests'') may be transferred to a Person who takes delivery

<<<

 in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the ``Regulation S Book-Entry Interests'') only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such

<<<

 transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.
Prior to 40 days after the date of initial issuance of the Notes, ownership of Regulation S Book-Entry Interests will be limited to Persons that have accounts

<<<

 with Euroclear or Clearstream or Persons who hold interests through Euroclear or Clearstream, and any sale or transfer of such interest to US persons shall not be permitted during such period unless such resale or transfer is made pursuant

<<<

 to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. Subject to the foregoing, Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of 144A Book-Entry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written

<<<

 certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a Person who the transferor reasonably believes is a ``qualified institutional buyer'' within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction

<<<

 meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under ``Notice to Investors'' and in accordance with any applicable securities law of any other jurisdiction.
Any Book-Entry Interest

<<<

 that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which

<<<

 it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note to which it was transferred.
If Definitive

<<<

 Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of SEK 1,000,000 principal amount and integral multiples of SEK 1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates

<<<

, opinions and other documentation required by the Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant which owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests

<<<

. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect

<<<

 to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more fully under ``Notice to Investors''.
Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred or exchanged

<<<

, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of SEK 1,000,000 in principal amount and integral multiples of SEK 1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging

<<<

 holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, where appropriate, to furnish certain certificates and opinions

<<<

, and to pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with such transfer.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer

<<<

 is not required to register the transfer or exchange of any Notes:
(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Notes;
168

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Notes

<<<

 to be redeemed in part;
(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or
(4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of Control Offer or

<<<

 an Asset Disposition Offer.
The Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agents and the Registrar will be entitled to treat the Holder of a Note as the owner of it for all purposes.
Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries
On the Issue

<<<

 Date, all of the Issuer's Subsidiaries will be Restricted Subsidiaries. However, in the circumstances described below under ``--Certain Definitions-- Unrestricted Subsidiary'', the Issuer will be permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries

<<<

 as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture.
Security
General
On the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured by first ranking security interests granted on an

<<<

 equal and ratable first priority basis over (i) all of the Capital Stock of the Issuer and the Company; (ii) the intercompany loan receivables owed to HoldCo by the Issuer and to the Issuer by the Company and certain of its Subsidiaries; (iii

<<<

) the Issuer's rights under the Acquisition Agreement and (iv) the Canal Digital Acquisition Funding Account. During the Post-Completion Period, the Issuer shall procure that the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes will also, subject to

<<<

 the Agreed Security Principles, be secured by first ranking security interests granted on an equal and ratable first priority basis over (i) all of the Capital Stock of each Guarantor (other than HoldCo and the Company), (ii) certain intercompany

<<<

 loan receivables owed to the Guarantors and (iii) certain trade marks (collectively, the ``Collateral''). The pledge agreements in respect of the Collateral are referred to as the ``Security Documents''. Any other additional security interests

<<<

 that may in the future be granted to secure the obligations under the Notes and the Indenture would also constitute Collateral.
Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under ``-- Certain Covenants--

<<<

 Limitation on Liens'' and ``--Certain Covenants-- Impairment of Security Interests'', the Issuer is permitted to pledge the Collateral in connection with future issuances of its Indebtedness or Indebtedness of its Restricted Subsidiaries, including

<<<

 any Additional Notes, in each case, permitted under the Indenture and other Indebtedness of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries.
The proceeds from the sale of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders of

<<<

 the Notes. No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with this offering of Notes. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the Collateral

<<<

 may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. See ``Risk Factors-- Risks Relating to the Notes--The Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the Notes''.
Priority
The relative priority among (i) the

<<<

 lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, (ii) the lenders under the Senior Bridge Facility, (iii) the counterparties under certain hedging contracts and (iv) the Trustee and the Holders under the Indenture, with respect to the Collateral

<<<

 and the security interests securing obligations under the Notes created by the Security Documents (the ``Security Interests'') is established by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Indenture and the Security Documents. See ``Description

<<<

 of Certain Financing Arrangements-- Intercreditor Agreement''.
Security Documents
Under the Security Documents, the Issuer and Holdco have granted security (and the Issuer shall procure that, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, security

<<<

 is granted under the Security Documents by the Company and its Subsidiaries) over the Collateral to secure the payment when due of the Issuer's and the Guarantors' payment obligations under the Notes, the Guarantees and the Indenture. The Security

<<<

 Documents have or will be entered into by the relevant security provider and the
169

Security Agent as agent for the secured parties. When entering into the Security Documents, the Security Agent will act in its own name, but as a representative

<<<

 of the secured parties (including the Holders from time to time). Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent will also act on behalf of the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the counterparties under certain hedging

<<<

 contracts and the lenders under the Senior Bridge Facility in relation to the Security Interest in favor of such parties.
The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement

<<<

, the Notes and the Guarantees of the Notes, as applicable, will be secured by the Security Interests in the Collateral. However, the Security Interests with respect to the Notes and the Guarantees of the Notes may be released under certain

<<<

 circumstances as provided under ``-- Release of Liens'' below. See ``Risk Factors-- Risks Related to Our Structure--There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the collateral securing the Notes and the

<<<

 Notes Guarantees will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Trustee''.
The Security Documents provide that the rights with respect to the Notes and the Guarantees of the Notes must be exercised by the Security

<<<

 Agent. Since the Holders are not a party to the Security Documents, Holders may not, individually or collectively, take any direct action to enforce any rights in their favor under the Security Documents. The Holders may only act through the

<<<

 Security Agent.
In the event that the Issuer or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings, the Security Interests created under the Security Documents or the rights and obligations enumerated in the Intercreditor

<<<

 Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of the Security Interests or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement were successful, the Holders might not be able to recover any amounts under the Security

<<<

 Documents. See the section entitled ``Risk Factors-- Risks Related to Our Structure--The Notes Guarantees and security interest will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain

<<<

 defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability''.
Enforcement of Security Interests
The Intercreditor Agreement restricts the ability of the Trustee or the Holders of the Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action

<<<

. Subject to the calculation requirements described below, the Security Agent is required to only act on the direction of creditors holding more than 50% of the Indebtedness and commitments under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, hedging

<<<

 obligations and the Notes (the ``Majority Senior Secured Creditors''). So long as the Notes constitute no more than 25% or no less than 662/3% of the aggregate Indebtedness and commitments of the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, the votes

<<<

 of holders of the Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action will be treated as proportionately equal to the same as votes of lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and hedging counterparties. However, so long

<<<

 as the Notes constitute more than 25% or less than 66%% of the aggregate Indebtedness and commitments of such creditors, the Notes will be deemed to constitute 25% of the aggregate Indebtedness and commitments under the Senior Secured Credit

<<<

 Facilities, hedging obligations and the Notes. Accordingly, the ability of the Holders of the Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action in such circumstances will be diminished relative to the lenders under the Senior

<<<

 Secured Credit Facilities and the hedging counterparties. In addition, certain of the Security Interests also secure the Senior Bridge Facility and the Intercreditor Agreement provides for circumstances in which the lenders under the Senior

<<<

 Bridge Facility may instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action in respect of such Security Interests if, amongst other things, the Security Agent has not been instructed to take enforcement action or if the Security Agent has been

<<<

 instructed to take no enforcement action.
The Intercreditor Agreement also provides that in relation to any request for a vote, action or decision by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, including instructions to the Security Agent to enforce

<<<

 the Collateral, any such creditor, which includes Holders of the Notes, which fails to respond to, or fails to provide details of its credit participation to, the Security Agent within the timescale specified by the Security Agent (which shall

<<<

 be no less than 20 business days from the date of the relevant request) shall have its credit participation deemed as being zero for the purposes of calculating the participation of the Majority Senior Secured Creditors in respect of such vote

<<<

, action or decision. If holders of the Notes are unable to respond within the required timeframes, their ability to control or influence matters concerning their rights as holders of the Notes may be lost and such matters will be determined

<<<

 by other creditors which may have interests different from the holder of the Notes. For a description of security enforcement
170

and other intercreditor provisions, see ``Description of Certain Financing Arrangements-- Intercreditor Agreement

<<<

''.
Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to Be Bound Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below) entered into in compliance with the covenant described under

<<<

 ``-- Certain Covenants--Additional Intercreditor Agreements''. The Indenture will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement and any

<<<

 Additional Intercreditor Agreement and to have authorized the Trustee to enter into any such Intercreditor Agreement or any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement.
Release of Liens The Issuer and the Guarantors will be entitled to release

<<<

 the Security Interests in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees under any one or more of the following circumstances: (1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of the Collateral to a Person that is not the

<<<

 Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary (other than a Receivables Subsidiary) (but excluding any transaction subject to ``-- Certain Covenants-- Merger and Consolidation''), if such sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant described

<<<

 under ``-- Certain Covenants-- Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock'' and is otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture; (2) in connection with the release of a Guarantor from its Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the

<<<

 Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor; (3) as described under ``--Amendments and Waivers'', ``-- Certain Covenants-- Impairment of Security Interests'' and the second paragraph under ``--Certain

<<<

 Covenants-- Limitation on Liens''; (4) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or defeasance or discharge of the Notes, as provided in ``-- Defeasance'' and ``--Satisfaction and Discharge''; (5) if

<<<

 the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property, assets and Capital Stock of such Unrestricted Subsidiary; (6) in connection

<<<

 with a transaction permitted by the covenant described below under the caption ``--Certain Covenants-- Merger and Consolidation''; or (7) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture. In addition, the Security Interests created by

<<<

 the Security Documents will be released in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement. The Security Agent and the Trustee (as applicable) will take all necessary action required to effectuate any release

<<<

 of the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security Document. Each of the releases set

<<<

 forth above shall be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the Holders or any action on the part of the Trustee.
Optional Redemption Except as described below and except as described under ``Redemption for Taxation Reasons'

<<<

', the Notes are not redeemable until November 1, 2014. On and after November 1, 2014 the Issuer may redeem all or, from time to time, part of the Notes upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, at the following redemption prices

<<<

 (expressed as a percentage of the principal amount) plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts (as defined below), if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of the Holders of record on

Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or

<<<

 the portion thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date. Any such redemption and notice may, in the Issuer's discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent.

Prior to November 1,2014, the

<<<

 Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 35% of the original principal amount of the Notes (including the principal amount of any Additional Notes), upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, with funds in an aggregate

<<<

 amount (the ``Redemption Amount'') not exceeding the Net Cash Proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings at a redemption price of 109.250% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but

<<<

 not including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided that:

(1) at least 65% of the original principal

<<<

 amount of the Notes (including the principal amount of any Additional Notes) remains outstanding after each such redemption; and

(2) the redemption occurs within 180 days after the closing of such Equity Offering.

Any redemption notice given

<<<

 in respect of the redemption referred to in the preceding paragraph may be given prior to completion of the related Equity Offering, and any such redemption or notice may, at the Issuer's discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or

<<<

 more conditions precedent, including the completion of the related Equity Offering.

In addition, prior to November 1,2014, the Issuer may redeem all or, from time to time, a part of the Notes upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice

<<<

 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus the Applicable Premium and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of Holders

<<<

 of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date). Any such redemption and notice may, at the Issuer's discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent.

``Applicable

<<<

 Premium" means, with respect to any Note the greater of:

(A) 1% of the principal amount of such Note; and

(B) the excess (to the extent positive) of:

(i) the present value at such redemption date of (i) the redemption price of such Note

<<<

 at November 1, 2014 (such redemption price (expressed in percentage of principal amount) being set forth in the table above under the first paragraph of this section (excluding accrued and unpaid interest)), plus (ii) all required interest

<<<

 payments due on such Note to and including November 1,2014 (excluding accrued but unpaid interest), computed upon the redemption date using a discount rate equal to the Swedish Government Bond Rate at such redemption date plus 50 basis points

<<<

; over

(ii) the outstanding principal amount of such Note,

as calculated by the Issuer or on behalf of the Issuer by such Person as the Issuer shall designate. For the avoidance of doubt, calculation of the Applicable Premium shall not be

<<<

 an obligation or duty of the Trustee or Paying Agents.

``Swedish Government Bond Rate" means the yield to maturity at the time of computation of direct obligations of the Kingdom of Sweden, acting through the Swedish National Debt Office 

<<<

(a Swedish Government Bond; Sw. statsobligation) with a constant maturity (such yield to be the weekly average yield as officially compiled and published in the most recent financial statistics that has become publicly

172

available at least

<<<

 two Business Days (but not more than five Business Days) prior to the redemption date (or, if such financial statistics are not so published or available, any publicly available source of similar market data selected by the Issuer in good faith

<<<

)) most nearly equal to the period from the redemption date to November 1, 2014; provided, however, that if the period from the redemption date to November 1,2014 is not equal to the constant maturity of a direct obligation of the Kingdom of

<<<

 Sweden, acting through the Swedish National Debt Office for which a weekly average yield is given, the Swedish Government Bond Rate shall be obtained by linear interpolation (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth of a year) from the weekly

<<<

 average yields of direct obligations of the Kingdom of Sweden, acting through the Swedish National Debt Office, for which such yields are given, except that if the period from such redemption date to November 1,2014 is less than one year, the

<<<

 weekly average yield on actually traded direct obligations of the Kingdom of Sweden, acting through the Swedish National Debt Office, adjusted to a constant maturity of one year shall be used.
General
Notice of redemption will be provided as

<<<

 set forth under ``Selection and Notice'' below.
If the Issuer effects an optional redemption of Notes, it will, for so long as the Notes are listed on the Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock

<<<

 Exchange so require, inform the Luxembourg Stock Exchange of such optional redemption and confirm the aggregate principal amount of the Notes that will remain outstanding immediately after such redemption.
If the optional redemption date is

<<<

 on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional

<<<

 interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Issuer.
Sinking Fund
The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes.
Redemption at Maturity

<<<


On September 29, 2018, the Issuer will redeem the Notes that have not been previously redeemed or purchased and canceled at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and Additional Amounts, if any, to the redemption

<<<

 date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).
Selection and Notice
If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee or the

<<<

 Registrar will select Notes for redemption in compliance with the requirements of the principal securities exchange, if any, on which the Notes are listed, and in compliance with the requirements of Euroclear or Clearstream, or if the Notes

<<<

 are not so listed or such exchange prescribes no method of selection and the Notes are not held through Euroclear or Clearstream, or Euroclear or Clearstream prescribes no method of selection based on a method that most nearly approximates

<<<

 a pro rata selection as the Trustee deems fair and appropriate; provided, however, that no Note of SEK 1,000,000 in aggregate principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part and only Notes in integral multiples of SEK 1,000, will be redeemed

<<<

. Neither the Trustee nor the Registrar will be liable for any selections made by it in accordance with this paragraph.
For so long as the Notes are listed on the Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, not less than 30 nor more than

<<<

 60 days prior to the redemption date, the Issuer will mail notice of redemption to Holders by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at their respective addresses as they appear on the registration books of the Registrar. Such notice of redemption

<<<

 may also be posted on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu), to the extent and in the manner permitted by the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.
If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of

<<<

 redemption that relates to that Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. In the case of a Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of

<<<

 any Definitive Registered Note redeemed in part will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of
173

the original Definitive Registered Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such

<<<

 Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice, Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after

<<<

 the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of Notes called for redemption.
Redemption for Taxation Reasons
The Issuer may redeem the Notes, in whole but not in part, at its discretion at any time upon giving not less

<<<

 than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior notice to the holders of the Notes (which notice will be irrevocable), at a redemption price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to

<<<

 the date fixed by the Issuer for redemption (a ``Tax Redemption Date'') and all Additional Amounts (if any) then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise (subject to the right of holders

<<<

 of the Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date and Additional Amounts (if any) in respect thereof), if on the next date on which any amount would be payable in respect of the Notes, the

<<<

 Issuer or any Guarantor is or would be required to pay Additional Amounts, and (a) the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor cannot avoid any such payment obligation by taking reasonable measures available to it, (b) in the case of a Guarantor,

<<<

 such amounts cannot be paid by the Issuer or any other Guarantor who in turn can pay such amount without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts and (c) the requirement arises as a result of:
(1) any amendment to, or change in, the laws (or

<<<

 any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder) of a relevant Tax Jurisdiction (as defined in the ``Withholding Taxes'' section below) which change or amendment is announced and becomes effective on or after the Issue Date (or, if the applicable

<<<

 Tax Jurisdiction became a Tax Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date); or
(2) any amendment to, or change in, an official written interpretation or application of such laws, regulations or rulings (including by virtue

<<<

 of a holding, judgment, order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice) which amendment or change is announced and becomes effective on or after the Issue Date (or, if the applicable Tax Jurisdiction

<<<

 became a Tax Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date).
The Issuer will not give any such notice of redemption earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor would be obligated

<<<

 to make such payment or withholding if a payment in respect of the Notes was then due, and the obligation to pay Additional Amounts must be in effect at the time such notice is given. Prior to the publication or, where relevant, mailing of

<<<

 any notice of redemption of the Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an opinion of independent tax counsel (the choice of such counsel to be subject to the prior written approval of the Trustee (such approval

<<<

 not to be unreasonably withheld)) to the effect that there has been such amendment or change which would entitle the Issuer to redeem the Notes hereunder. In addition, before the Issuer publishes or mails notice of redemption of the Notes as

<<<

 described above, it will deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate to the effect that (a) it or the relevant Guarantor cannot avoid its obligation to pay Additional Amounts by the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor taking reasonable measures

<<<

 available to it and (b) in the case of a Guarantor, such amounts cannot be paid by the Issuer or any other Guarantor without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts.
The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer's Certificate

<<<

 and opinion of counsel as sufficient evidence of the existence and satisfaction of the conditions precedent as described above, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the holders of the Notes.
For the avoidance of doubt, the implementation

<<<

 of European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any other directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting of 26 and 27 November 2000 on the taxation of savings income or any law implementing or complying with or introduced

<<<

 in order to conform to, such directive will not be a change or amendment for such purposes.
The foregoing will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor Person to the Issuer is incorporated or organized, engaged in business

<<<

 or resident for tax purposes or any jurisdiction from or through which payment is made by or on behalf of such Person on the Notes and any political subdivision thereof or therein.
174

Withholding Taxes
All payments made by the Issuer under

<<<

 or with respect to the Notes or any of the Guarantors with respect to any Guarantee will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future tax, duty, levy, assessment or other governmental

<<<

 charge, including any related interest, penalties or additions to tax (``Taxes'') unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied

<<<

 by or on behalf of (1) any jurisdiction in which the Issuer or any Guarantor is then incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or resident for tax purposes or any political subdivision thereof or therein or (2) any jurisdiction

<<<

 from or through which payment is made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (including the jurisdiction of any paying agent for the Notes) or any political subdivision thereof or therein (each, a ``Tax Jurisdiction'') will at any time

<<<

 be required to be made from any payments made by the Issuer under or with respect to the Notes or any of the Guarantors under or with respect to any Guarantee, including payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium, the Issuer

<<<

 or the relevant Guarantor, as applicable, will pay such additional amounts (the ``Additional Amounts'') as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments by each holder of the Notes after such withholding

<<<

, deduction or imposition (including any such withholding, deduction or imposition from such Additional Amounts) will equal the respective amounts that would have been received in respect of such payments in the absence of such withholding or

<<<

 deduction; provided, however, that no Additional Amounts will be payable with respect to:
(1) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been imposed but for the existence of any actual or deemed present or former connection between

<<<

 the holder (or between a fiduciary, settler, beneficiary, member or shareholder of, or possessor of a power over the relevant holder, if the relevant holder is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation

<<<

) or the beneficial owner of the Notes and the relevant Tax Jurisdiction (including being a resident of such jurisdiction for Tax purposes), other than the holding of such Note, the enforcement of rights under such Note or under a Guarantee

<<<

 or the receipt of any payments in respect of such Note or a Guarantee;
(2) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes were imposed as a result of the presentation of a Note for payment more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made available

<<<

 for payment to the holder (except to the extent that the holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Note been presented on the last day of such 30 day period);
(3) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer or similar

<<<

 Taxes;
(4) any Taxes withheld, deducted or imposed on a payment to an individual that are required to be made pursuant to European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any other directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting

<<<

 of November 26 and 27, 2000 on the taxation of savings income, or any law implementing or complying with or introduced in order to conform to, such directive;
(5) Taxes imposed on or with respect to a payment made to a holder or beneficial

<<<

 owner of Notes who would have been able to avoid such withholding or deduction by presenting the relevant Note to another Paying Agent in a member state of the European Union;
(6) any Taxes payable other than by deduction or withholding from

<<<

 payments under, or with respect to, the Notes or with respect to any Guarantee;
(7) any Taxes to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure of the holder or beneficial owner of Notes, to comply with any reasonable

<<<

 written request of the Issuer addressed to the holder or beneficial owner and made at least 60 days before any such withholding or deduction would be payable to satisfy any certification, identification, information or other reporting requirements

<<<

, whether required by statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of a Tax Jurisdiction, as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of, Taxes imposed by the Tax Jurisdiction (including

<<<

, without limitation, a certification that the holder or beneficial owner is not resident in the Tax Jurisdiction), but in each case, only to the extent the holder or beneficial owner is legally eligible to provide such certification or documentation

<<<

; or
(8) any combination of items (1) through (7) above.
175

In addition to the foregoing, the Issuer and the Guarantors, as the case may be, will also pay and indemnify the holder for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court

<<<

 or documentary Taxes, or any other excise or property Taxes, charges or similar levies (including penalties, interest and any other reasonable expenses related thereto) which are levied by any Tax Jurisdiction on the execution, delivery, issuance

<<<

, or registration of any of the Notes, the Indenture, any Guarantee or any other document or instrument referred to therein, or the receipt of any payments with respect thereto, or enforcement of, any of the Notes or any Guarantee (limited,

<<<

 solely in the case of taxes attributable to the receipt of any payments with respect thereto, to any such taxes imposed in a Tax Jurisdiction that are not excluded under clauses (1) through (5) or (7) above).
If the Issuer or any Guarantor

<<<

, as the case may be, becomes aware that it will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment under or with respect to the Notes or any Guarantee, each of the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be, will deliver

<<<

 to the Trustee on a date that is at least 30 days prior to the date of that payment (unless the obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to that payment date, in which case the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor shall

<<<

 notify the Trustee promptly thereafter) an Officer's Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable. The Officer's Certificate must also set forth any other information reasonably

<<<

 necessary to enable the paying agents to pay such Additional Amounts to holders on the relevant payment date. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer's Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.
The

<<<

 Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will make all withholdings and deductions required by law and will remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Tax authority in accordance with applicable law. The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor

<<<

 will use its reasonable efforts to obtain Tax receipts from each Tax authority evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld. The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will furnish to the Trustee (or to a holder or beneficial owner

<<<

 upon written request), within a reasonable time after the date the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld is made, certified copies of Tax receipts evidencing payment by the Issuer or a Guarantor, as the case may be, or if, notwithstanding

<<<

 such entity's efforts to obtain receipts, receipts are not obtained, other evidence of payments (reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee) by such entity. Upon reasonable request, copies of Tax receipts or other evidence of payments, as the case

<<<

 may be, will be made available by the Trustee to the holders or beneficial owners of the Notes.
Whenever in the Indenture or in this ``Description of Notes'' there is mentioned, in any context, the payment of amounts based upon the principal

<<<

 amount of the Notes or of principal, interest or of any other amount payable under, or with respect to, any of the Notes or any Guarantee, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that

<<<

, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.
The above obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, any transfer by a holder or beneficial owner of its Notes,

<<<

 and will apply, mutatis mutandis, to any jurisdiction in which any successor Person to the Issuer or any Guarantor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or resident for tax purposes or any jurisdiction from or through

<<<

 which payment is made by or on behalf of such Person on the Notes or any Guarantee and any political subdivision thereof or therein.
Change of Control
If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, subject to the terms of the covenant described

<<<

 under this heading ``Change of Control'', each Holder will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part (equal to SEK 1,000,000 or an integral multiple of SEK 1,000 in excess thereof) of such Holder's Notes at a purchase

<<<

 price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest

<<<

 payment date); provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be obliged to repurchase Notes as described under this heading, ``Change of Control'', in the event and to the extent that it has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all

<<<

 of the Notes as described under ``--Optional Redemption'' or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived.
Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes as described under ``-- Optional

<<<

 Redemption'' or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuer will send a notice
176

(the ``Change of Control Offer'') to each

<<<

 Holder of any such Notes by mail or otherwise in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee:
(1) stating that a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has

<<<

 the right to require the Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder's Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of purchase

<<<

 (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the ``Change of Control Payment'');
(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than

<<<

 60 days from the date such notice is mailed) and the record date (the ``Change of Control Payment Date'');
(3) stating that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest after the Change

<<<

 of Control Payment Date unless the Change of Control Payment is not paid, and that any Notes or part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue interest;
(4) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions

<<<

 that constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event;
(5) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder must follow in order to have its Notes repurchased; and
(6) if such notice is mailed

<<<

 prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, stating that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control Triggering Event.
On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control

<<<

 Triggering Event shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful:
(1) accept for payment all Notes or portion thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;
(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to

<<<

 the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes so tendered;
(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of the Notes being purchased by the

<<<

 Issuer in the Change of Control Offer;
(4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the principal Paying Agent the Global Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes or portions thereof that have been

<<<

 tendered to and purchased by the Issuer; and
(5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer.

<<<


If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee will promptly instruct its authenticating

<<<

 agent to authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Definitive Registered Note equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any;

<<<

 provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount that is at least SEK 1,000,000 and integral multiples of SEK 1,000 in excess thereof.
For so long as the Notes are listed on the Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange

<<<

 and the rules of such exchange so require, the Issuer will publish a notice with respect to the results of the Change of Control Offer as soon as reasonably practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date on the official website of the

<<<

 Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu).
The Change of Control provisions described above will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control

<<<

 Triggering Event, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder's right

<<<

 to require the Issuer to repurchase such Holder's Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event may deter a third party from seeking to
177

acquire the Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute

<<<

 a Change of Control Triggering Event.
The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control Triggering Event if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in

<<<

 compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to

<<<

 the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control and the absence of a Rating Decline, if a definitive agreement

<<<

 is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made.
The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations

<<<

 in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws

<<<

 and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of the conflict.
The Issuer's ability to repurchase Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control

<<<

 Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event would require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. In addition

<<<

, certain events that may constitute a change of control under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under such agreement may not constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event under the Indenture

<<<

. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries (including without limitation the Senior Secured Credit Facilities) may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness

<<<

 to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of

<<<

 Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer's ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer's then existing financial resources. There can be

<<<

 no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See ``Risk Factors-- Risks Related to Our Structure--The Group may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to

<<<

 repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control triggering event as required by the Indenture''.
The definition of ``Change of Control'' includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property

<<<

 and assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase ``substantially all'', there is no precise established definition of

<<<

 the phrase ``substantially all'' under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of ``all or substantially all'' of the property

<<<

 or assets of a Person. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.
The provisions of

<<<

 the Indenture relating to the Issuer's obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be waived or modified with the written consent of holders of a majority in outstanding principal

<<<

 amount of the Notes.
Certain Covenants
Limitation on Indebtedness
The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness); provided, however, that the Issuer and

<<<

 any Subsidiary Guarantor may Incur Indebtedness if on the date of such Incurrence and after giving pro forma effect thereto (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof), the Consolidated Leverage Ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted

<<<

 Subsidiaries is no greater than (x) 5.5 to 1.0, if the date of such Incurrence is prior to the one-year anniversary of the Issue Date or (y) 5.25 to 1.0, if the date of such Incurrence is on or after the one-year anniversary of the Issue Date

<<<

.
178

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness:
(1) Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to any Credit Facility (including in respect of letters

<<<

 of credit or bankers' acceptances issued or created thereunder), and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof and Guarantees in respect of such Indebtedness in a maximum aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not exceeding

<<<

 (i) SEK 7,600 million, plus (ii) in the case of any refinancing of any Indebtedness permitted under this clause (1) or any portion thereof, the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred

<<<

 in connection with such refinancing, less (iii) the aggregate amount of all Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions since the Issue Date applied by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to the covenant described under ``-- Limitation

<<<

 on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock'' to repay any Indebtedness under any Credit Facility incurred pursuant to this clause (1) (and in respect of any revolving credit facility, to permanently reduce commitments thereunder);
(2) (a) Guarantees

<<<

 by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided that (i) if such Indebtedness is by its express terms subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or the Guarantee of the Notes

<<<

 by such Restricted Subsidiary, as applicable, any such guarantee of the Issuer or a Guarantor with respect to such Indebtedness shall be subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or such Guarantor's Guarantee of the Notes, as applicable

<<<

, substantially to the same extent as such Indebtedness is subordinated to the Notes or the Guarantee of the Notes of such Guarantor, as applicable, and (ii) if such guarantee is of Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor, such Restricted

<<<

 Subsidiary complies with the third paragraph of this covenant; or
(b) without limiting the covenant described under ``-- Limitation on Liens'', Indebtedness arising by reason of any Lien granted by or applicable to such Person securing Indebtedness

<<<

 of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted under the terms of the Indenture;
(3) Indebtedness of the Issuer owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of a Restricted

<<<

 Subsidiary owing to and held by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that:
(a) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which results in any such Indebtedness being beneficially held by

 rules or the laws rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular

 Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:
(1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the

 Issuer, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of the clauses of the second paragraph or the first

<<<

 paragraph of this covenant; provided that Indebtedness incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of the description of this covenant cannot be reclassified;
(2) all Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date under the Senior Secured

<<<

 Credit Facilities shall be deemed initially Incurred on the Issue Date under clause (1) of the second paragraph of the description of this covenant and not the first paragraph or clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the description of this

<<<

 covenant;
(3) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers' acceptances or other similar instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount

<<<

 of Indebtedness shall not be included;
(4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers' acceptances or other similar instruments are Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause 

<<<

(1), (7), (11) or (13) of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers' acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included;

<<<


(5) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including

<<<

, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference thereof;
(6) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted

<<<

 in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness; and
(7) the amount of Indebtedness at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount

<<<

 of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS.
Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of

<<<

 additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will not be

<<<

 deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this ``-- Limitation on Indebtedness''. The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be (a) the accreted value thereof in the case of

<<<

 any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount and (b) the principal amount, or liquidation preference thereof, in the case of any other Indebtedness.
If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness

<<<

 of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this ``-- Limitation on

<<<

 Indebtedness'', the Issuer shall be in Default of this covenant).
For purposes of determining compliance with any SEK-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the SEK Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated

<<<

 in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or the date first committed, in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under

<<<

 a revolving credit facility; provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than SEK, and such refinancing would cause the applicable SEK-denominated restriction to be exceeded

<<<

 if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such SEK-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does

<<<

 not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced; (b) the SEK Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in

<<<

 effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if any such Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to SEK) covering
182

principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such

<<<

 Indebtedness expressed in SEK will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur

<<<

 pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different

<<<

 currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.
Neither

<<<

 the Issuer nor any Guarantor will incur any Indebtedness (including Permitted Debt) that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Guarantor unless such Indebtedness is also contractually

<<<

 subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and the applicable Guarantee in respect of the Notes on substantially identical terms; provided, however, that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment

<<<

 to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured, by virtue of being secured with different collateral, by virtue of being secured on a junior priority basis or by virtue of the application of waterfall

<<<

 or other payment-ordering provisions affecting different tranches of Indebtedness under Credit Facilities.
Limitation on Restricted Payments

); or (iv) to purchase the Notes pursuant to an offer to all holders of Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to at least 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of purchase

<<<

 (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date);
(b) to the extent the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary elects, to invest in or purchase or commit to

<<<

 invest in or purchase Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional Assets by a Restricted Subsidiary with Net Available Cash received by the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary) within 365 days from the later of

<<<

 (i) the date of such Asset Disposition and (ii) the receipt
190

of such Net Available Cash; provided, however, that any such reinvestment in Additional Assets made pursuant to a definitive binding agreement or a commitment approved by the

<<<

 Board of Directors of the Issuer that is executed or approved within such time will satisfy this requirement, so long as such investment is consummated within 180 days of such 365th day;
(c) to make a capital expenditure within 365 days from

<<<

 the later of (A) the date of such Asset Disposition and (B) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided, however, that any such capital expenditure made pursuant to a definitive binding agreement or a commitment approved by the Board of

<<<

 Directors of the Issuer that is executed or approved within such time will satisfy this requirement, so long as such investment is consummated within 180 days of such 365th day; or

 the final application of any such Net Available Cash in accordance with clause (a), (b), (c) or (d) above, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness or otherwise invest such Net Available Cash in any manner

<<<

 not prohibited by the Indenture.
Any Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested or committed to be applied or invested as provided in the preceding paragraph will be deemed to constitute ``Excess Proceeds''.

<<<

 On the 366th day (or the 546th day, in the case of any Net Available Cash committed to be used pursuant to a definitive binding agreement or commitment approved by the Board of Directors of the Issuer pursuant to clauses (b) or (c) of the second

<<<

 paragraph of this covenant) after the later of (A) the date of such Asset Disposition and (B) the receipt of such Net Available Cash, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds SEK 250 million, the Issuer will be required within ten

<<<

 (10) Business Days thereof to make an offer (``Asset Disposition Offer'') to all holders of Notes and, to the extent the Issuer elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness that is secured in whole or in part by a Lien

<<<

 on the Collateral which Lien ranks pari passu with the Liens securing the Notes, to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out of

<<<

 the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the case of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes and 100% of the principal amount

<<<

 of Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness

<<<

, as applicable, and in the case of the Notes, in minimum denominations of SEK 1,000,000 and in integral multiples of SEK 1,000 in excess thereof.
To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered

<<<

 and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to other covenants contained in the Indenture. If the

<<<

 aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall

<<<

 be allocated among the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness. For the purposes of calculating the principal amount

<<<

 of any such Indebtedness not denominated in SEK, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal amounts into their SEK Equivalent determined as of a date selected by the Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer

<<<

 Period (as defined below). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.
To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a currency

<<<

 other than the currency in which the relevant Notes are denominated, the amount thereof payable in respect of such Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in which such Notes are denominated that is actually received

<<<

 by the Issuer upon converting such portion of the Net Available Cash into such currency.
The Asset Disposition Offer, in so far as it relates to the Notes, will remain open for a period of not less than 20 Business Days following its commencement

<<<

 (the ``Asset Disposition Offer Period''). No later than five (5) Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the ``Asset Disposition Purchase Date''), the Issuer will purchase the principal amount of Notes and

<<<

, to the extent it elects, Pari Passu Indebtedness required to be purchased by it pursuant to this covenant (the ``Asset Disposition
191

Offer Amount'') or, if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all

<<<

 Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer.
On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary

<<<

, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness or portions of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition

<<<

 Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and, in the case of the Notes, in minimum denominations of SEK 1,000,000 and in integral

<<<

 multiples of SEK 1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate stating that such Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Issuer in accordance with the terms of this covenant. The

<<<

 Issuer or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, will promptly (but in any case not later than five (5) Business Days after termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver to each tendering Holder of Notes an amount equal

<<<

 to the purchase price of the Notes so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn by such Holder, and accepted by the Issuer for purchase, and the Issuer will promptly issue a new Note (or amend the applicable Global Note), and the Trustee

<<<

, upon delivery of an Officer's Certificate from the Issuer, will authenticate and mail or deliver (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) such new Note to such Holder, in a principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion of the Note surrendered

<<<

; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount with a minimum denomination of SEK 1,000,000. Any Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred by book-entry) by the Issuer to the Holder thereof.

<<<


For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be cash:
(1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness of the Issuer (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer) or Indebtedness

<<<

 of a Restricted Subsidiary and the release of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition;
(2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Issuer or any

<<<

 Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer from the transferee that are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition;
(3) Indebtedness of any Restricted

<<<

 Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with

<<<

 such Asset Disposition;
(4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer (other than Subordinated Indebtedness) received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; and
(5) any Designated

<<<

 Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant

<<<

 that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of 1.3% of Total Assets and SEK 200 million (with the fair market value of each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect

<<<

 to subsequent changes in value).
The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to

<<<

 the Indenture. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached

<<<

 its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of any conflict.
Limitation on Affiliate Transactions
The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter into or conduct any transaction

<<<

 or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Issuer (any such
192

transaction or series of related transactions being ``Affiliate

<<<

 Transactions'') involving aggregate value in excess of SEK 50 million unless:
(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than

<<<

 those that could be obtained in a comparable transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such transaction in arm's-length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and
(2) in the event

<<<

 such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of SEK 250 million, the terms of such transaction or series of related transactions have been approved by a resolution of the majority of the members of the Board of Directors

<<<

<<<

 Opinion'') from an Independent Financial Advisor that such Affiliate Transaction is fair, from a financial standpoint, to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries or that the terms are not materially less favorable than those that could reasonably

<<<

 have been obtained in a comparable transaction at such time on an arm's-length basis from a Person that is not an Affiliate.
The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:
(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant

<<<

 the comparable prior year period financial information of the Company may be provided in lieu thereof. Except as provided for above, no report need include separate financial statements for the Issuer or Subsidiaries of the Issuer or any disclosure

<<<

 with respect to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure not of a type included in this Offering Memorandum and in no event shall U.S. GAAP information or reconciliation to U.S. GAAP be required.

 preceding clause (a) owing to applicable law or after the use of its commercially reasonable efforts, furnish such reports to the Holders and, upon their

request, prospective purchasers of the Notes. The Issuer will also make available

<<<

 or (ii) the Issuer or HoldCo elects to provide to the Trustee reports which, if filed with the SEC, would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Issuer or HoldCo) the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act

 (other than the provision of U.S. GAAP or IFRS information, certifications, exhibits or information as to internal controls and procedures), for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information

<<<

, documents and other reports that the Issuer or HoldCo is, or would be, required to file with the SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d). Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the

<<<

 provisions contained in the preceding four paragraphs.
In addition, so long as the Notes remain outstanding and during any period during which the Issuer is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act nor exempt therefrom pursuant

<<<

 to Rule 12g3-2(b), the Issuer shall furnish to the Holders and, upon their request, prospective purchasers of the Notes, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

<<<

 of related transactions to, any Person, unless:
(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the ``Successor Company'') (if not the Issuer) will be a Person organized and existing under the laws of any member state of the European Union

<<<

, or the United States of America, any State of the United States or the District of Columbia and the Successor Company (if not the Issuer) will expressly assume, (a) by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form

<<<

 reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture and (b) all obligations of the Issuer under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable;
(2) immediately after

<<<

 giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the Successor Company as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company

<<<

 or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;
(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Successor Company would be able to Incur at least

<<<

 an additional SEK 1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under ``-- Limitation on Indebtedness'' or (b) the Consolidated Leverage Ratio would not be greater than it was immediately prior to giving effect

<<<

 to such transaction; and
(4) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each to the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply with

<<<

 the Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental indenture (if any) has been duly authorized, executed and delivered and is a legal, valid and binding agreement enforceable against the Successor Company (in each

<<<

 case, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee); provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer's Certificate as to any matters of fact.
Any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Issuer

<<<

 or any Restricted Subsidiary (or that is deemed to be Incurred by any Restricted Subsidiary that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) as a result of any such transaction undertaken in compliance with this covenant, and any Refinancing Indebtedness

<<<

 with respect thereto, shall be deemed to have been Incurred in compliance with the covenant described under ``-- Limitation on Indebtedness''.
196

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other

<<<

 disposition of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Issuer, which properties and assets, if held by the Issuer instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the

<<<

 properties and assets of the Issuer on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer.
The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise

<<<

 every right and power of, the Issuer under the Indenture but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets, the predecessor company will not be released from its obligations under the Indenture or the Notes.
Notwithstanding

<<<

 the preceding clauses (2) and (3) (which do not apply to transactions referred to in this sentence) and clause (4) of the first paragraph of this covenant (which does not apply to transactions referred to in this sentence in which the Issuer

<<<

 is the surviving entity), (a) any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to the Issuer and (b) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate

<<<

 or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to any other Restricted Subsidiary. Notwithstanding the preceding clause (3) (which does not apply to the transactions referred to in this sentence)

<<<

, the Issuer may consolidate or otherwise combine with or merge into an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of the Issuer, reincorporating the Issuer in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal

<<<

 form of the Issuer.
There is no precise established definition of the phrase ``substantially all'' under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would

<<<

 involve ``all or substantially all'' of the property or assets of a Person.
The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this ``Merger and Consolidation'' covenant) shall not apply to (i) any

<<<

 transactions which constitute an Asset Disposition if the Issuer has complied with the covenant described under ``-- Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock'' or (ii) the creation of a new subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary of

<<<

 the Issuer.
The Guarantors

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person

<<<

 (whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving corporation);
(2) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of, all or substantially all its assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, in one transaction or a series

<<<

 of related transactions, to any Person; or
(3) permit any Person to merge with or into it;
unless:
(A) the other Person is the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor or becomes a Guarantor; or
(B) (1) either (x) a Guarantor

<<<

 is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Guarantor under its Guarantee and the Indenture (pursuant to a supplemental indenture executed and delivered in a

<<<

 form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee) and all obligations of the Guarantor under the Intercreditor Agreement and Security Documents, as applicable; and
(2) immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default or Event of Default

<<<

 shall have occurred and is continuing; or
(C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of a Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of a Guarantor

<<<

 (in each case other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the Indenture and the proceeds therefrom are applied as required by the Indenture,
provided, however, that the prohibition in clauses (1), (2) and (3

<<<

) of this covenant shall not apply to the extent that compliance with clauses (A) and (B)(1) could give rise to or result in: (1) any breach or
197

violation of statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference

<<<

, thin capitalization rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws, rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction, (2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or (except

<<<

 in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or 

<<<

(3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out of pocket expenses.
Notwithstanding the preceding clause (B)(2) (which does not apply to transactions referred to in this sentence

<<<

), (a) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to a Guarantor or the Issuer and (b) any Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into

<<<

 or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to any other Guarantor or the Issuer. Notwithstanding the preceding clause (B)(2) (which does not apply to the transactions referred to in this sentence), a Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise

<<<

 combine with or merge into an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of the Guarantor reincorporating the Guarantor in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of the Guarantor.
There is no

<<<

 precise established definition of the phrase ``substantially all'' under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve ``all or substantially

<<<

 all'' of the property or assets of a Person.
Limitation on HoldCo Activities
Notwithstanding anything contained in the Indenture:
(1) HoldCo will not engage in any business activity, except any such activity (i) reasonably relating to the offering

<<<

, sale, issuance, incurrence and servicing, purchase, redemption, amendment, exchange, refinancing or retirement of or investment in the Notes, the Senior Bridge Facility, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or other Indebtedness permitted

<<<

 by the terms of the Indenture and the Senior Bridge Facility and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof and by the terms of any Indebtedness of a Parent; (ii) undertaken with the purpose of fulfilling any other obligations under the

<<<

 Notes, the Senior Bridge Facility and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof, any additional notes in respect of both of the foregoing, the Indenture, the Senior Bridge Facility and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof,

<<<

 the Guarantees (including guarantees in respect of the Senior Bridge Facility and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof and Senior Secured Credit Facilities), the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, Hedging Obligations, other Indebtedness

<<<

 or any other obligations permitted by the terms of the Indenture and the Senior Bridge Facility and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof, any Security Document to which it is a party or the Intercreditor Agreement (or any additional

<<<

 intercreditor agreement entered into pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or the Indenture); (iii) involving the provision of administrative services to its Subsidiaries of a type customarily provided by a holding company to

<<<

 its Subsidiaries and the receipt of any amounts related thereto to the extent permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement; (iv) directly related or reasonably incidental to the establishment and/or maintenance of HoldCo's corporate existence

<<<

, the acquisition, holding or disposition of assets permitted to be held by it under the Indenture and the Senior Bridge Facility and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof or reasonably related to its function as an intermediate holding

<<<

 company; or (v) other activities not specifically enumerated above that are immaterial in nature.
(2) HoldCo will not own any assets or property other than the Capital Stock of the Issuer, intercompany Indebtedness, cash and Cash Equivalents

<<<

, any Indebtedness of MidCo, HoldCo, the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries and other assets and properties that are immaterial in nature; provided that HoldCo may from time to time receive in a transaction otherwise permitted under the Indenture

<<<

, the Senior Bridge Facility and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof and the Security Documents properties and assets (including cash, Cash Equivalents, Temporary Cash Investments, shares of Capital Stock of another Person and/or

<<<

 Indebtedness and other obligations) for the purpose of transferring such properties and assets to any holding company of HoldCo, and any of its Subsidiaries or any other Person, so long as in any case such further transfer is made promptly

<<<

 by HoldCo and, after giving effect thereto, HoldCo is again in compliance with this clause.
198

Additional Guarantors
Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Issuer shall ensure that within 120 days after the end of each

<<<

 fiscal year of the Issuer that the Consolidated EBITDA (determined separately and without double counting) for such fiscal year of each of the Issuer and the Guarantors shall be equal to or exceed the lesser of (i) 75% of Consolidated EBITDA

<<<

 and (ii) 75% of EBITDA (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities on the Issue Date, and if such definition is no longer used or applicable under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, then only clause (i) shall apply) for such ended

<<<

 fiscal year of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries by causing one or more of its Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors to become Guarantors to the extent necessary to ensure the foregoing threshold is met. A Restricted Subsidiary

<<<

 that is not a Guarantor may become a Guarantor if it executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will Guarantee payment of the Notes on the terms and conditions set forth in the

<<<

 Indenture. For purposes of calculating Consolidated EBITDA for any such period, any acquisitions (including through mergers or consolidations) or dispositions that were made or occurred during such period shall be given pro forma effect as

<<<

 if such acquisition or disposition occurred at the beginning of such period Any such pro forma calculations shall be made in a manner consistent with other pro forma calculations made pursuant to the Indenture.
Each additional Guarantee will

<<<

 be limited as necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate benefit, capital maintenance or

<<<

 similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer shall not be obligated to cause any Restricted Subsidiary to Guarantee

<<<

 the Notes to the extent that such Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary would reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in a breach or violation of statutory limitations, rules regarding corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent

<<<

 preference, thin capitalization, capital maintenance, guidance and coordination rules or the laws, rules and regulations of any applicable jurisdiction, which, in any case, cannot be prevented or otherwise avoided through measures reasonably

<<<

 available to the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiary or any risk or liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of

<<<

 a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership), and any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes but excluding any obligation under the Guarantee

<<<

 itself) other than reasonable out of pocket expenses.
Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status
If on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no Default or Event of Default

<<<

 has occurred and is continuing (a ``Suspension Event''), then, the Issuer shall notify the Trustee of these events and beginning on that day and continuing until such time, if any, at which the Notes cease to have Investment Grade Status (the

<<<

 ``Reversion Date''), the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the following captions will not apply to the Notes: ``-- Limitation on Restricted Payments'', ``-- Limitation on Indebtedness'', ``-- Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions

<<<

 from Restricted Subsidiaries'', ``-- Limitation on Affiliate Transactions'', ``-- Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock'', the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under ``-- Merger and Consolidation

<<<

'' and ``-- Impairment of Security Interests'' and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be applicable to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries. Such covenants and any related

<<<

 default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the first day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard to actions of the Issuer properly taken during

<<<

 the continuance of the Suspension Event, and the ``-- Limitation on Restricted Payments'' covenant will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of the Indenture except that no Default will be deemed to have occurred solely

<<<

 by reason of a Restricted Payment made while that covenant was suspended. On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be classified, at the Issuer's option, as having been Incurred pursuant

<<<

 to the first paragraph of the covenant described under ``-- Limitation on Indebtedness'' or one of the clauses set forth in the second paragraph of such covenant (to the extent such Indebtedness would be permitted to be Incurred thereunder

<<<

 as of the Reversion Date and after giving effect to Indebtedness Incurred prior to the Suspension Event and outstanding on the Reversion Date). To the extent such Indebtedness would not be so permitted to be incurred under the first two paragraphs

<<<

 of the covenant described under ``-- Limitation on Indebtedness'', such Indebtedness will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that
199

it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the covenant

<<<

 described under ``-- Limitation on Indebtedness''.
Impairment of Security Interests
The Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or omit to take any action that would have the result of materially impairing

<<<

 the Security Interests with respect to the Collateral (it being understood, subject to the proviso below, that the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the Security Interests with

<<<

 respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and the Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the

<<<

 Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral, except that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries

<<<

 may Incur Permitted Collateral Liens and the Collateral may be discharged, amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released, modified or replaced in accordance with the Indenture, the applicable Security Documents and/or the Intercreditor

<<<

 Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement; provided, however, that, except with respect to any discharge, amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement in accordance with the Indenture

<<<

 or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens or any action expressly permitted by the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement

<<<

, the Security Documents may not be discharged, amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released or otherwise modified or replaced, unless contemporaneously with any such action, the Issuer delivers to the Trustee, either (1) a solvency

<<<

 opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee from an Independent Financial Advisor confirming the solvency of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such

<<<

 discharge, amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, (2) a certificate from the Board of Directors of the relevant Person which confirms the solvency of the person granting such Security Interest

<<<

 after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement, or (3) an Opinion of Counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, confirming

<<<

 that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such discharge, amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the Security Documents, so discharged, amended, extended

<<<

, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified or replaced are valid Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior

<<<

 to such discharge, amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement. In the event that the Issuer complies with the requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to customary

<<<

 protections and indemnifications) consent to such amendments without the need for instructions from the Holders.
Additional Intercreditor Agreements
The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Issuer, in connection with the Incurrence

<<<

 by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries of any (1) Indebtedness permitted pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under ``-- Limitation on Indebtedness'' or clause (1), (4)(a) and (b), (6), (7) (other than with respect

<<<

 to Capitalized Lease Obligations), (11), (13) or (15) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under ``-- Limitation on Indebtedness'' and (2) any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of Indebtedness referred to in the foregoing clause

<<<

 (1), the Issuer, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized Representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an ``Additional Intercreditor

<<<

 Agreement'') or a restatement, amendment or other modification of the existing Intercreditor Agreement on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable to the Holders), including containing

<<<

 substantially the same terms with respect to release of Guarantees and priority and release of the Security Interests; provided that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security

<<<

 Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee or Security Agent under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement.
200

The Indenture

<<<

 also will provide that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of Holders, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity

<<<

, omission, defect or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by the Issuer or a Guarantor that is subject to any such agreement (including with

<<<

 respect to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior in right of payment to the Notes), (3) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement

<<<

 or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the Notes (including Additional Notes), (5) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure Additional Notes, (6) implement any Permitted Collateral Liens

<<<

, (7) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof or (8) make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect. The

<<<

 Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the Holders of the majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, except

<<<

 as otherwise permitted below under ``Amendments and Waivers'', and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee

<<<

 or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement

The Indenture shall also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the Holders to the payment, repayment, purchase

<<<

, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations subordinated to the Notes thereby; provided, however, that such transaction would comply with the covenant described under ``-- Limitation on Restricted Payments

<<<

''.
The Indenture also will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (whether then entered

<<<

 into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein), and to have directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement.
Events of Default
Each of the following is an

<<<

 ``Event of Default'' under the Indenture:
(1) default in any payment of interest on any Note issued under the Indenture when due and payable, continued for 30 days;
(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on

<<<

 any Note issued under the Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise;
(3) failure by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to comply for 30 days after

<<<

 notice by the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes with any of its obligations under the covenants described under ``Change of Control'' above or under the covenants described under ``-- Certain

<<<

 Covenants'' above (in each case, other than a failure to purchase Notes which will constitute an Event of Default under clause (2) above);
(4) failure by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to comply for 60 days after notice by

<<<

 the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes with its other agreements contained in the Indenture;
(5) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which

<<<

 there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) other than Indebtedness owed

<<<

 to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the Issue Date, which default:
(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at stated maturity on such Indebtedness, immediately

<<<

 upon the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness (``payment default''); or
201

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the ``cross-acceleration provision''),
and, in each case, the

<<<

 principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates SEK 250 million or more;

<<<


(6) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for HoldCo and its

<<<

 Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary (the ``bankruptcy provisions'');
(7) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited

<<<

 consolidated financial statements for HoldCo), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of SEK 250 million (exclusive of any amounts that a solvent insurance company has acknowledged liability for

<<<

), which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after the judgment becomes final (the ``judgment default provision'');
(8) any security interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in full

<<<

 force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture) with respect to Collateral having a Fair Market Value in excess

<<<

 of SEK 100 million for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture or the release of any such security interest in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional

<<<

 Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents or any such security interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or the Issuer shall assert in writing that any such security interest is invalid or unenforceable

<<<

 and any such Default continues for 10 days (the ``security default provisions''); and
(9) any Guarantee of the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of such Guarantee

<<<

 or the Indenture) or is declared invalid or unenforceable in a judicial proceeding or any Guarantor denies or disaffirms in writing its obligations under its Guarantee and any such Default continues for 10 days (the ``guarantee provisions'

<<<

').
However, a default under clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture notify the Issuer of

<<<

 the default and, with respect to clauses (3), (4), (5) and (7) the Issuer does not cure such default within the time specified in clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7), as applicable, of this paragraph after receipt of such notice.
If an Event of Default

<<<

 (other than an Event of Default described in clause (6) above) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Issuer or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture by written notice to

<<<

 the Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes under the Indenture to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration

<<<

, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (5) under ``Events of Default'' has occurred

<<<

 and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (5) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the

<<<

 holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration

<<<

 of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest on the Notes that became due solely because of the

<<<

 acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived.
If an Event of Default described in clause (6) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes will become and be immediately

<<<

 due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.
202

Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents

<<<

 except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.
The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive all past or existing

<<<

 Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict

<<<

 with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.
Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to

<<<

 exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee, and the Trustee has received, indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee

<<<

 against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:
(1) such Holder has previously given

<<<

 the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;
(2) Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy;
(3) such Holders have offered the Trustee, and the

<<<

 Trustee has received, security and/or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense;
(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security

<<<

 and/or indemnity; and
(5) the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period

<<<

.
Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising

<<<

 any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.
The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent

<<<

 person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or

<<<

 that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses and expenses

<<<

 caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within

<<<

 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as a committee of trust officers of the

<<<

 Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer's Certificate indicating whether the

<<<

 signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute

<<<

 certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.
The Notes provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified

<<<

 and/or secured to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of

<<<

 an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly.
Amendments and Waivers
Subject to certain exceptions, the Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified with the consent of the Holders of a majority

<<<

 in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding
203

(including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions

<<<

 thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes). However, without

<<<

 the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% of the then outstanding principal amount of Notes affected (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes), an amendment or waiver

<<<

 may not, with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:
(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, waiver or modification;
(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment

<<<

'');
(3) reduce the principal of, or extend the Stated Maturity of, any Note;

(

<<<

5) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Note (except to the extent the currency stated in the Notes has been succeeded or replaced pursuant to applicable law);
(6) impair the right of any Holder to receive payment of

<<<

 principal of and interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on such Holder's Notes on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or with respect to such Holder's Notes (other than, for the avoidance

<<<

 of doubt, any payment pursuant to a Change of Control Offer or pursuant to the provisions of the covenant described under the caption ``-- Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock'');
(7) make any change in the provision of the Indenture

<<<

 described under ``Withholding Taxes'' that adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Notes in any material respect or amends the terms of such Notes in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described

<<<

 thereunder or an exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described thereunder unless the Payer agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;
(8) release all or substantially all the security interests granted

<<<

 for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral other than in accordance with the terms of the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement, any applicable Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture;
(9) waive a Default or Event

<<<

 of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal

<<<

 amount of such Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration); or
(10) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders' consent described in this sentence.
Notwithstanding the

<<<

 foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Security Agent and the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Notes Documents to:
(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency

<<<

;
(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or any Guarantor under any Notes Document;
(3) add to the covenants or provide for a Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any right or power

<<<

 conferred upon the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;
204

(4) make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders or does not adversely affect the rights or benefits to the Trustee or any of the

<<<

 Holders in any material respect under the Notes Documents;
(5) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Issuer) for the issuance of Additional Notes;
(6) to provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Guarantee

<<<

 in accordance with the covenant described under ``--Certain Covenants-- Limitation on Indebtedness'', to add Guarantees with respect to the Notes, to add security to or for the benefit of the Notes, or to effectuate or confirm and evidence

<<<

 the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any Guarantee or Lien (including the Collateral and the Security Documents) or any amendment in respect thereof with respect to or securing the Notes when such release, termination, discharge

<<<

 or retaking or amendment is provided for under the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;
(7) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Guarantees, the Security Documents or

<<<

 the Notes to any provision of this Description of Notes to the extent that such provision in this Description of Notes was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, a Guarantee, the Security Documents or the Notes

<<<

;
(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor Trustee or Security Agent pursuant to the requirements thereof or to

<<<

 provide for the accession by the Trustee or Security Agent to any Notes Document;
(9) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest in favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of parties

<<<

 to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, in any property which is required by the Senior Secured Credit Facilities (as in effect on the Issue Date) to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a security interest is required to be

<<<

 granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a security interest in the Collateral for the benefit of any Person; provided that the granting of such security interest is not prohibited by the Indenture or the Intercreditor

<<<

 Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the covenant described under ``-- Certain Covenants-- Impairment of Security Interests'' is complied with; or
(10) as provided in ``--Certain Covenants--Additional Intercreditor Agreements

<<<

''.
In formulating its decision on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to require and rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems necessary, including Officer's Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.
The Issuer will, for so long as the

<<<

 Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, to the extent required by the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, inform the Luxembourg Stock Exchange of any of the foregoing amendments, supplements and waivers and provide, if necessary

<<<

, a supplement to this Offering Memorandum setting forth reasonable details in connection with any such amendments, supplements or waivers.
The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any

<<<

 proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any Holder of Notes given in connection with a tender of such Holder's Notes

<<<

 will not be rendered invalid by such tender.
For so long as the Notes are listed on the Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of such exchange so require, the Issuer will publish notice of any amendment, supplement

<<<

 and waiver in Luxembourg in a daily newspaper with general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort). Such notice of any amendment, supplement and waiver may also be published on the website of the Luxembourg

<<<

 Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu), to the extent and in the manner permitted by the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.
Acts by Holders
In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of the Notes have concurred in any

<<<

 direction, waiver or consent, the Notes owned by the Issuer or by any Person directly or indirectly
205

controlled, or controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control with, the Issuer will be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding

<<<

.
Defeasance
The Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture (``legal defeasance'') and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain obligations, including those

<<<

 respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning issuing temporary Notes, registration of Notes

<<<

, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the Security Documents

<<<

 and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time will terminate (other than with respect to the defeasance trust).
The Issuer at any time may terminate

<<<

 its obligations under the covenants described under ``-- Certain Covenants'' (other than clauses (1) and (2) of ``--Certain Covenants-- Merger and Consolidation'') and ``Change of Control'' and the default provisions relating to such covenants

<<<

 described under ``Events of Default'' above, the operation of the cross-default upon a payment default, the cross-acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to the Issuer and Significant Subsidiaries, the judgment default

<<<

 provision, the guarantee provision and the security default provision described under ``Events of Default'' above (``covenant defeasance'').
The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior

<<<

 exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to such Notes. If the Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance

<<<

 option with respect to the Notes, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3) (other than with respect to clauses (1) and (2) of the covenant described under ``-- Certain Covenants-- Merger

<<<

 and Consolidation''), (4), (5), (6) (with respect only to the Issuer and Significant Subsidiaries), (7), (8) or (9) under ``Events of Default'' above.
In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust

<<<

 (the ``defeasance trust'') with the Trustee (or an entity designated by it for this purpose) cash in SEK or SEK-denominated European Government Obligations or a combination thereof for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest

<<<

 on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:
(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States to the effect that Holders of the Notes will not

<<<

 recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been

<<<

 the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel in the United States must be based on a ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other change in applicable U

<<<

.S. federal income tax law);
(2) an Officer's Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer;
(3) an Officer's Certificate

<<<

 and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that that all conditions precedent provided for or relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may

<<<

 be, have been complied with;
(4) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the trust resulting from the deposit does not constitute, or is qualified as, a regulated investment company under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended

<<<

; and
(5) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee all other documents or other information that the Trustee may reasonably require in connection with either defeasance option.
206

Satisfaction and Discharge
The Indenture, and the rights of the

<<<

 Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents will be discharged and cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of conversion or transfer or

<<<

 exchange of the Notes, as expressly provided for in the Indenture) as to all outstanding Notes when (1) either (a) all the Notes previously authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes, and certain Notes for

<<<

 which provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Issuer) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or (b) all Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have

<<<

 become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of

<<<

 redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the Issuer has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or an entity designated by it for this purpose), money or SEK-denominated European Government

<<<

 Obligations, or a combination thereof, as applicable, in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on the Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest to

<<<

 the date of deposit (in the case of Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be; (3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the Indenture; and (4)

<<<

 the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions) each to the effect that all conditions precedent under the ``Satisfaction

<<<

 and Discharge'' section of the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture have been complied with; provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer's Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance

<<<

 with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)).
No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders
No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates

<<<

, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer under the Notes Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases

<<<

 all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws, and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver

<<<

 is against public policy.
Listing and general information
Application has been made to list the Notes on the Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to admit the Notes to trading on the Euro MTF Market. There can be no assurance

<<<

 that the application to list the Notes on the Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to admit the Notes to trading on the Euro MTF Market will be approved as of the Issue Date or at any time thereafter, and settlement of the Notes

<<<

 is not conditioned on obtaining this listing. The Issuer has initially designated Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. as its listing agent (the ``Listing Agent''). The address of the Listing Agent is 2, boulevard Konrad Adenauer, L-1115 Luxembourg

<<<

.
So long as the Notes are listed on the Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange shall so require, copies, current and future, of all of our annual audited consolidated and unconsolidated

<<<

 financial statements, our unaudited consolidated interim quarterly financial statements and this Offering Memorandum may be obtained, free of charge, during normal business hours at the registered office of the Issuer.
Concerning the Trustee

<<<

 and Certain Agents
Deutsche Trustee Company Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set

<<<

 forth specifically in the Indenture. The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available

<<<

 to the Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. During the existence of an Event of Default, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same degree of care that a prudent Person would

<<<

 use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty.
207

The Issuer shall deliver written notice to the

<<<

 Trustee with thirty (30) days of becoming aware of the occurrence of a Default or Event of Default. The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of the Issuer, to obtain payment of

<<<

 claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions with the Issuer and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.
Any

<<<

 removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee.
The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification and/or security of the Trustee by the Issuer and the

<<<

 Guarantors for any loss, liability, taxes or expenses incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture.
Notices
All notices

<<<

 to Holders of the Notes will be validly given if mailed to them at their respective addresses in the register of the Holders of such Notes, if any, maintained by the Registrar. In addition, for so long as any of the Notes are listed on the

<<<

 Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, notices with respect to the Notes will be published in a newspaper having a general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to

<<<

 be the Luxemburger Wort) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, posted on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu). In addition, for so long as any Notes are represented by Global Notes, all

<<<

 notices to Holders of the Notes will be delivered to Euroclear and Clearstream, each of which will give such notices to the holders of Book-Entry Interests.
Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication

<<<

 or, if published more than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are mailed, such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the seventh day after

<<<

 being so mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed within the time prescribed. Failure to

<<<

 mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee

<<<

 receives it.
Prescription
Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of principal, or premium, if any, on the Notes will be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims against the Issuer or

<<<

 any Guarantor for the payment of interest on the Notes will be prescribed five years after the applicable due date for payment of interest.
Currency Indemnity and Calculation of SEK-Denominated Restrictions
SEK is the sole currency of account

<<<

 and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the Guarantors under or in connection with the Notes and the Guarantees, as the case may be, including damages. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than SEK, whether as a result

<<<

 of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Guarantor or otherwise by any Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from

<<<

 the Issuer or a Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of the SEK amount, which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency

<<<

 on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is practicable to do so).
If that SEK amount is less than the SEK amount expressed to be due to the recipient

<<<

 or the Trustee under any Note, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss sustained by such recipient or the Trustee as a result. In any event, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient or the Trustee

<<<

 on a joint or several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder of a Note or the Trustee to certify

<<<

 in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer (indicating the sources of information used) the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuer's and the Guarantors

<<<

' other obligations, will give
208

<<<

 in registered form without interest coupons attached (the ``Regulation S Global Note'' and, together with the Rule 144A Global Note, the ``Global Notes''). The Global Notes will be deposited, on the Issue Date, with a common depositary and

<<<

 registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the account of Euroclear and Clearstream.
Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Note (``Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests'') and ownership of interests in the Regulation

<<<

 S Global Note (the ``Regulation S Book-Entry Interests'' and, together with the Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests, the ``Book-Entry Interests'') will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or persons that hold interests

<<<

 through such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers' securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositories. Except

<<<

 under the limited circumstances described below, Book-Entry Interests will not be issued in definitive form.
Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained by Euroclear and Clearstream

<<<

 and their participants. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of those securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations

<<<

 may impair your ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not be considered the owners or ``holders'' of Notes for any purpose.
So long as

<<<

 the Notes are held in global form, Euroclear or Clearstream (or their respective nominees), as applicable, will be considered the sole holders of the Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture. In addition, participants must rely on

<<<

 the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and the participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any

<<<

 rights of holders of Notes under the Indenture.
Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee will have any responsibility, or be liable, for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.
Redemption of the Global Notes
In the event that

<<<

 any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by them in respect of the redemption of such

<<<

 Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note

<<<

 (or any portion thereof). The Issuer understands that, under the existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of its Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their participants' accounts

<<<

 on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions), by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate (including pool factor), provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than SEK 1,000,000, principal

<<<

 amount may be redeemed in part.
Payments on Global Notes
The Issuer will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any) to the common depositary

<<<

 or its nominee for Euroclear and Clearstream. The common depositary will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their customary procedures. The Issuer will make payments of all such amounts without deduction or withholding

<<<

 for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature, except as may be required by law and as described under ``Description of Notes-- Withholding Taxes.'' If any such deduction

<<<

 or withholding is required to be made, then, to the extent described under ``Description of Notes-- Withholding Taxes,'' the Issuer will pay additional amounts as may be necessary for the net amounts received by any holder of the Global Notes

<<<


239

or owner of Book-Entry Interests after such deduction or withholding to equal the net amounts that such holder or owner would have otherwise received in respect of such Global Note or Book-Entry Interest, as the case may be, absent such

<<<

 withholding or deduction. The Issuer expects that standing customer instructions and customary practices will govern payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through such participants.
Under the terms of the Indenture

<<<

, the Issuer, the Trustee and the agents will treat the registered holders of the Global Notes (e.g., Euroclear or Clearstream (or their respective nominee)) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes

<<<

. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Trustee or any of their respective agents have or will have any responsibility or liability for:
 any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating

 Interest;

Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests
Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of a Note (including the presentation of Notes for exchange as described above) only at the

<<<

 direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such participant or participants has

<<<

 or have given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default under the

<<<

 Notes, Euroclear and Clearstream, at the request of the holders of the Notes, reserve the right to exchange the Global Notes for definitive registered Notes in certificated form (the ``Definitive Registered Notes''), and to distribute such

<<<

 Definitive Registered Notes to their participants.
Transfers
Transfers between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in accordance with Euroclear and Clearstream's rules and will be settled in immediately available funds

<<<

. If a holder of a Note requires physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell Notes to persons in states that require physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder of Notes

<<<

 must transfer its interests in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture.
The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth

<<<

 under ``Notice to Investors.'' Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification requirements discussed under ``Notice to Investors.''
Transfers of Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests to

<<<

 persons wishing to take delivery of Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests will at all times be subject to such transfer restrictions.
Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Regulation S Book

<<<

-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act

<<<

 or any other exemption (if available under the U.S. Securities Act).
Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of

<<<

 a written certification (in the form
240

provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a ``qualified institutional buyer'' within the meaning of Rule 144A in

<<<

 a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under ``Notice to Investors'' and in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any other jurisdiction.
In connection

<<<

 with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding

<<<

 increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Note.
Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note only as described under ``Description of Notes-- Transfer and Exchange,''

<<<

 if required, only if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes

<<<

. See ``Notice to Investors.''
Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry

<<<

 Interest in the first-mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note, and accordingly will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests

<<<

 in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest.
Definitive Registered Notes
Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive Definitive Registered Notes:
(1) if Euroclear or Clearstream

<<<

 notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days;
(2) if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered

<<<

 through Euroclear or Clearstream following an event of default under the Indenture and enforcement action is being taken in respect thereof under the Indenture.
Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that upon request by an owner

<<<

 of a Book-Entry Interest described in the immediately preceding clause (2), their current procedure is to request that the Issuer issue, or cause to be issued, Notes in definitive registered form to all owners of Book-Entry Interests.
In such

<<<

 an event, the Registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear, Clearstream or the Issuer, as applicable (in accordance with their

<<<

 respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend as provided in the Indenture

<<<

, unless that legend is not required by such Indenture or applicable law.
To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agents and the Registrar shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the

<<<

 absolute owner thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the Global Notes will be evidenced through registration from time to time at the registered office of the Issuer, and such registration

<<<

 is a means of evidencing title to the Notes.
We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the Book-Entry Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts

<<<

 in Euroclear and Clearstream.
Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream
All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable. We provide the following summaries of those

<<<

 operations and procedures solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of the settlement system are controlled by the
241

settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither the Issuer nor any of the Initial

<<<

 Purchasers is responsible for those operations or procedures. The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They facilitate the clearance

<<<

 and settlement of securities transactions between their participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping

<<<

, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such

<<<

 as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear

<<<

 through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Because Euroclear and Clearstream can act only on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants

<<<

 and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be

<<<

 limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests

<<<

 to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.
Global

<<<

 Clearance and Settlement under the Book-Entry System The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF market. Transfers of interests

<<<

 in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective system's rules and operating procedures. Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing

<<<

 procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued

<<<

 or modified at any time. None of the Issuer, the Notes Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee or the Paying Agents will have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear, Clearstream or their participants or indirect participants

<<<

 of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.
Initial Settlement Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in Swedish. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or Clearstream accounts will

<<<

 follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the business day following the settlement

<<<

 date against payment for value of the settlement date.
Secondary Market Trading The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear and Clearstream and will settle in same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place

<<<

 of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser's and the seller's accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.
