RISK FACTORS
Investments in Bonds always entail a risk and an investment in the Company

<<<

's Bonds is not an exception in this respect. Potential investors should give careful consideration to all the information provided in the Prospectus and in particular assess the specific risk factors mentioned below which describe certain risks

<<<

 inherent in an investment in the Bonds. Each o f the risk factors below and other risks and uncertainties mentioned in the Prospectus could, i f they are realized, have a material negative effect on the Group's business, results, financial

<<<

 position or outlook, or result in a reduction in the value o f the Bonds, which can lead to investors losing all or part o f their invested capital. The risks and uncertainties described below are not stated in order o f significance and do

<<<

 not represent the only risks and uncertainties faced by Prime Living. Further risks and uncertainties o f which the Company is currently not aware or perceives as being insignificant could also develop into factors that could have a material

<<<

 adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition or outlook.
RISKS RELATED TO THE GROUP'S BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY
Changes in macroeconomicfactors can lead to higher vacancy rates, increased costs and lower rental

<<<

 rates The real estate business and its industry related risks are to a large extent affected by macroeconomic factors such as the general economic trend, growth rate, employment rate, production rate of new premises, changes of infrastructure

<<<

, population growth, inflation and interest rates. The development of the economy affects the employment rate, which is a material factor for supply and demand on the real estate market and accordingly affects vacancy and rental rates for the

<<<

 properties.
Expectations regarding the inflation affect the interest rate and therefore affect the Company's net financial income. The interest cost for debts to, inter alia, financial institutions is a major cost for Prime Living. In the long

<<<

 term, changes in the interest rate have a significant effect on Prime Living's result and cash flow. Inflation also affects Prime Living's costs. In addition, changes in the interest rate and the inflation also affect the yield requirements

<<<

 and thus the market value of the properties. As of the date of the Prospectus, Prime Living's tenants are only housing tenants and constitute a dominating share of the rent incomes. Negative changes in the macroeconomic factors could adversely

<<<

 affect the Company's operations, result and financial position.
Changes in supply and demand on real estate in different geographical markets can lead to lower yields on real estate investments Supply and demand regarding real estate and therefore

<<<

 the yield on real property investments differ between various geographical markets and may also develop differently on different geographical markets. Prime Living has a diversified real estate portfolio with real estate in different geographical

<<<

 markets, with its latest subsidiary established on Ireland as the first step in expanding on the Irish and UK markets. There is a risk that demand levels may be low on several or all geographical markets, or that the Irish/UK expansion fails

<<<

 or becomes less profitable than expected, which may have an adverse effect on Prime Living's operations, result or financial position.
Prime Living is affected by the level o f rental rate income, the rental level which can be maintained by

<<<

 the Company regarding its rental apartments, and runs the risk o f tenants notpaying rent on time If the rental level or rent level falls, for whatever reason, it may have an adverse effect on Prime Living's result. The risk of large swings

<<<

 in vacancy levels and loss of rental income increases in a real estate company with a number of large, individual tenants. As of the date of the Prospectus, Prime Living only has housing tenants (students) except in Lund where Lund University

<<<

 rents all apartments and in Beryllgatan, Gothenburg, where Chalmers University of Technology has signed a rental agreement for 86 of the 208 apartments.
Prime Living is dependent on tenants paying agreed rents on time and therefore there is

<<<

 a risk regarding tenants suspending their payments or otherwise not fulfilling their obligations, which may have an adverse effect on Prime Living's operations, result or financial position.
Prime Living is exposed to risks relating to disruptions

<<<

 in production As of the date of the Prospectus, Prime Living's modules are manufactured by external suppliers in China. These suppliers sometimes rent space in the premises where the modules are manufactured. There is a risk that the
3

external

<<<

 parties' rent agreements or other agreements important for production of modules expire or are terminated which could result in contracted deliveries of modules being delayed or absent. There is also a risk that negative events, outside the

<<<

 Company's control, occur such as local strikes, factory fires, material shortage, natural disasters or other events that cause disruptions in production or that contracted deliveries of modules are delayed or absent. If any of these risks were

<<<

 to materialize, it could have an adverse effect on Prime Living's operations, result or financial position.
Prime Living's housing modules are manufactured in China and there is a risk that the housing modules are damaged or destroyed during

<<<

 transport both at sea and on land Prime Living manufactures its housing modules at two external factories located in China. The modules' size corresponds to the standard that applies to transport containers and the finished modules are then

<<<

 transported by shipping, usually to the discharge port closest to the location where the housing modules are to be established. The transportation from the port to the final destination is usually made by truck. There is a risk that the transports

<<<

 are delayed or otherwise exposed to events such as shipwreck, groundings, cargo washed over board, collisions, traffic accidents or heavy weather, which may delay the transport and/or damage or completely destroy the housing modules as they

<<<

 are transported. If any of these risks were to materialize, and if the loss/damage cannot be recovered from insurance compensation, it could have an adverse effect on Prime Living's operations, result or financial position.
Prime Living is

<<<

 exposed to risks relating to its real estate developmentprojects Prime Living's business largely covers real estate development project in the form of new construction. Thus, a prerequisite for the Company's continued development of such projects

<<<

 is that they can be carried out with economic profitability. The ability to conduct real estate development projects with economic profitability is partly dependent of a number of factors, such as that Prime Living's ability to retain and recruit

<<<

 the necessary competence in areas such as construction, engineering, design and sales, obtaining and maintaining necessary permits and administrative decisions (including time-limited planning permissions that may be terminated prematurely

<<<

) and procuring contracts for project implementation on acceptable terms for the Company. There is a risk that procured contracts, e.g. for reasons attributable to the entrepreneur, are delayed or can not be completed, which in turn could, inter

<<<

 alia, lead to increase project costs, or that Prime Living's customers direct claims against the Company due to breach of contract.
Further, Prime Living's real estate development depends on current supply and financing of new project on acceptable

<<<

 terms for the Company, including, inter alia, access to new property for construction, obtaining construction permits, building authorization and development of current and new collaborations with partners. The ability to conduct real estate

<<<

 development projects with economic profitability may, inter alia, be affected by if the projects adequately respond to the market's demand, if demand or markets rents change in general, the lack of planning, analysis and cost control, changes

<<<

 in taxes and fees, and other factors that can lead to delays or increased unexpected project costs.
Technical risks exist in new construction as well as in real estate management. These include risks of defects relating to the construction

<<<

 of the property, other latent shortcomings or deficiencies, damages (for instance due to fire or failure of equipment) and environmental hazards. If any technical problems should occur, such occurrence may result in a delay in planned new construction

<<<

 or increased costs for new construction and the management of the Company's real estate.
Furthermore, there is a risk that the Company fails to obtain and maintain the necessary regulatory decisions or permits for new contraction or change

<<<

 of use of current real estate, or that changes to permits, plans, regulations or legislation leads to the real estate development project being delayed, more expensive or not being realized at all.
If one or more of the factors above would

<<<

 develop negatively or if any of the above risks would materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on Prime Living's reputation, operation, result or financial position.
4

Prime Living's standardized manufacturing method regarding

<<<

 the housing modules entails the risk of construction error or quality defects The Company's housing modules are manufactured using a standardized method and selected materials. This creates cost benefits but entails the risk that any construction

<<<

 error and/or quality defects may occur, affecting a few to several housing modules. Furthermore, the Company founded its first residential complex based on modules in 2011 and there is a risk that the result of a more long-term use of the housing

<<<

 reveals construction errors and/or quality defects that are still unknown. If construction error and/or quality defects should arise, it could have a material adverse effect on Prime Living's reputation, operation, result or financial position

<<<

.
Increased operating costs may potentially not befully compensated by the lease agreements and extensive renovation needs can lead to increased maintenance costs Operating expenses primarily consist of costs that are tariff-based, such as costs

<<<

 for electricity, sanitation, water and heating. Many of these goods and services can only be purchased from one trader, which can affect the prices. To the extent that potential increase in prices are not offset by regulating leasing agreement

<<<

, or increases in rents by renegotiation of the lease agreement, Prime Living's results or financial position can be negatively affected.
Expenditures for maintenance are attributable to measures aimed to maintain the standard of the property

<<<

 on a long-term basis. These costs are expensed to the extent they constitute repairs and replacement of minor parts. Other additional expenses of maintenance nature are capitalized in connection with the incurred expense. Prime Living has a

<<<

 plan for the implementation of maintenance measures deemed necessary. Unforeseen and extensive renovation needs may affect Prime Living's reputation, operation, result or financial position.
Prime Living is dependent upon its counterparties

<<<

 to meet itsfinancial obligations Credit risk is defined as Prime Living's counterparties not being unable to fulfil their financial obligations towards Prime Living. The Company's current and potential customers and other counterparties may

<<<

 end up in a financial situation where they are not able to pay the agreed rents or otherwise abstain from fulfilling their obligations. Credit risks within the financial operations arise, inter alia, from the investment of excess liquidity

<<<

 and by obtaining long- and short-term credit agreements.
Furthermore, the Company has entered into a lease agreement with Lund University including 200 student apartments and with Chalmers University of Technology concerning 86 of the 208 apartments

<<<

 in Beryllgatan Gothenburg. Lund University is state-funded and its financial allotment is based on political decisions. In the future, Prime Living may come to conclude similar agreements with the same or other universities. There is a risk

<<<

 that Prime Living's counterparties can not fulfill their obligations. Loss of rental income or other income may therefore have an adverse effect on the Company's operation, result or financial position.
Prime Living and its subsidiaries have

<<<

 madefinancial commitments in loan agreements If Prime Living or any of its subsidiaries, regardless of in which jurisdictions, breach one or more financial or other commitments in one or more loan or bond agreements, it could result in the

<<<

 loan being terminated with immediate repayment or credit institutions claiming collateral, which could have an adverse effect on the Company's operation, financial position or result.
Prime Living's interest expenses are affected by changes

<<<

 in interest rates Apart from the Company's Bonds loan and equity, the Group's operations are mainly financed by loans from credit institutions. Interest rate risk is defined as the risk that changes in interest rates and the marginal between

<<<

 government bonds and banks/credit institutions affect Prime Living's interest expenses. Interest expenses are mainly affected by, besides the extent of interest-bearing debt, the level of current market interest rates and the credit institutions

<<<

' margins, and the Prime Living's strategy regarding interest rate fixation periods.
Market rates are mainly affected by the expected inflation rate. The short interest are mainly affected by the Swedish National Bank's (Sw: Riksbanken) repurchase

<<<

 rate, which constitutes a monetary policy steering instrument. Monetary policy in Sweden aims at adjusting the repurchase rate in order to keep the inflation at two percent. In times o f rising inflation expectations the interest rates are

<<<

 expected to rise, and in times o f declining inflation expectations, interest rates are expected to fall. The longer the average maturity time on Prime Living's Bonds, the longer it takes for changes in interest rates to have an impact on the

<<<

 Company's interest expenses. If a
5

possible future need of capital arises and this is solved by borrowing, the Company will be subject to additional interest costs, which could also mean an increase interest rate risk that may adversely

<<<

 affect the company's result or financial position.
Refinancing o f existing debt may prove to be impossible or associated with significantly increased costs Refinancing risk relates to risk that financing can not be obtained at all, or only

<<<

 at a significantly higher cost. The Group's interest bearing debt amount to approximately SEK 864.9 million as of 31 December 2016. There is a risk that Prime Living will not be able to refinance its existing debt obligations alternatively

<<<

 that this can not be done on reasonable terms, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's operations, financial position and result.
Prime Living's housing modules are manufactures by externalparties in China and the price

<<<

 on modules is affected by currencyfluctuations Currency risk relates to the risk of negative impact on the income statement and balance sheet as a result of currency fluctuations. Through its purchases of modules from China, Prime Living has

<<<

 a currency risk primarily against the Chinese CNY, but also a minor risk against the American USD relating to the transportation. Depending on the project, between 40 and 45 percent of the total production cost is procured in CNY. An appreciation

<<<

 of the CNY with 1 percent would therefore mean that the total cost of a construction will increase with between 0.40 and 0.45 percent. A depreciation of SEK would have an adverse effect on the Company's result and financial positions.
Intermediate

<<<

 goods and commodityprices Prime Living is dependent on its suppliers to have access to, inter alia, steel at competitive prices. Commodity prices are dependent on world market prices and currency development, but also on production capacity

<<<

. There is a risk that the price and volume fluctuations that have characterized the steel market, mainly because of competition, economic fluctuations, currency fluctuations and access to commodities, will arise in the future. It is also possible

<<<

 that situations arise where low sales prices can not be offset by correspondingly low commodity costs for Prime Living's suppliers. If Prime Living is not able to respond to changes in prices on intermediate goods and commodity prices, it may

<<<

 result in loss of competitiveness and reduced turnover and margins, which would have an adverse effect on the Company's operations, result or financial position.
The value of Prime Living's real estate portfolio may change Prime Living's investment

<<<

 properties are recognized on the balance sheet at fair market value and changes in value are recognized in the income statement. The value of the properties is affected by a number of factors, both property specific factors such as occupancy

<<<

 rates, rent levels and operating costs, and market specific factors such as yield requirements and cost of capital based on comparable transactions in the real estate market.
Both real estate specific deteriorations such as lower rent level

<<<

 and increased vacancy rates and market specific deteriorations such as higher yield requirements could lead to Prime Living reducing the fair value on its investment properties, which could have an adverse effect on the Company's result or

<<<

 financial position.
The Company conducts ongoing real estate transactions resulting in uncertainty and risks The Company conducts real estate transactions within the framework of its operations. All such transactions are associated with uncertainties

<<<

 and risks. Existing risks regards to acquisitions and building of real estate are e.g. uncertainties regarding the handling of tenants, unforeseen costs for environmental remediation, redevelopment and management of technical problems, regulatory

<<<

 approval and the emergence of disputes relating to the acquisition or the condition of the real estate. Such uncertainties may cause delays in projects or increased or unexpected costs for the real properties or transactions.
If the Company

<<<

 is unable to dispose the real properties at a favorable price or if claims are made against the Company it can mean delays of projects or increased or unexpected costs for the real properties or the transactions. Should any of the risk mentioned

<<<

 above be materialized, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company's operations, result or financial position.
6

Directors, other staff and operational risk Operational risk is defined as the risk of incurring losses due to deficient

<<<

 routines and/or irregularities. For its operations, Prime Living is dependent on a number of key director positions. These key directors contribute with high competence and long experience, which is important for the Company's operations. If

<<<

 one or more of these key people leaves Prime Living, or if the Company's administrative security and control should fail, it may have an adverse effect on the Company's operations, result or financial position.
Prime Living may need to adapt

<<<

 to a changed competitive situation Prime Living operates in a competitive industry. Prime Living's future competitive opportunities are, inter alia, dependent on Prime Living's ability to be at the forefront and quickly respond to existing

<<<

 and future market needs. Therefore, Prime Living may be forced to make costly investments, restructurings or price reductions in order to adapt to a new competitive situation. Increased competition could have an adverse effect on Prime Living

<<<

's operation, result or financial position.
Prime Living's business involves legal risks The real estate business is largely dependent on permits and decisions from authorities regarding, for example, housing rents. The regulated housing rents

<<<

, the so-called utility value system, both limits Prime Living's risks and affects its earning power. In the system, in simplified terms, landlords can not charge higher rents than the rents that have been determined in collective negotiations

<<<

 for houses in similar locations and of a similar standard.
If Prime Living can not offset the increased housing costs with increased rents, it could have an adverse effect on the Company's operations, financial position and result. New or amended

<<<

 laws and regulations or changes in the application of existing laws and regulations concerning, for example, ownership, operation and leasing of real estate, that apply to Prime Living's operations or its customers' operations, may mean increased

<<<

 costs, which could have an adverse effect on the Company's operations, financial position and result.
Disputes and legalproceedings Prime Living or its subsidiaries may become involved in disputes or claims. Such disputes may, inter alia, involve

<<<

 contractual issues, warranty claims, construction-related issues, alleged defects in delivery of modules, environmental issues and intellectual property rights. Pursuing legal proceedings may, inter alia, incur costs in relation with a settlement

<<<

, and imposed penalties and other obligations that may be imposed on the Company. A dispute that is lost, or otherwise not settled within a reasonable time frame, could entail significant costs for the Company and disrupt normal operations.

<<<

 The impact of these risks may have a material adverse effect on Prime Living's operations, result or financial position.
Prime Living's insurance coverage may notprove to be adequate to protect the Company against all liabilities that may arise

<<<

 in its operations Prime Living has insurance policies covering its core operations against losses and/or potential liability in relation to third party claims. The risks covered by the insurance include property damage, interruption in business

<<<

, construction related issues and compensation and benefits to employees. Furthermore, a board- and CEO insurance exists. Some types of losses are usually not covered by insurances because such losses are not deemed possible to insure against

<<<

. This may for example include damage caused by war or terrorism and official liability or personal liability resulting from negligence, willful intent or criminal acts. Furthermore, there may be losses expressly excluded or otherwise not covered

<<<

 by the Company's existing insurance policies.
Most of Prime Living's insurances are capped (insured amount) to certain maximum amount per claim or series of injuries, or for a total amount over a certain insurance period. Generally, indemnity

<<<

 is also dependent on whether the insured person has paid a surplus or excess and that the maximum amount under the insurance has not already been paid. If a loss is not covered by insurance, exceeds the amount limit or causes consequential

<<<

 losses, it could have a material adverse effect on Prime Living's operations, financial position or result.
Prime Living's operations involve environmental risks Management of real estate and real estate development entails environmental impact

<<<

. Prime Living has established an environmental policy and works actively with environmental issues. According to the Environmental Code (Sw: Miljobalken), those who engage in activities that contribute to pollution are also
7

responsible

<<<

 for remediation. If the operator can not carry out or pay for remediation of a contaminated property, the purchaser of the property, that knew or should have detected pollution before the acquisition, is responsible. This means that the claims

<<<

, under certain conditions, can be made against Prime Living for land decontamination or remediation, for the presence or suspicion of contamination in soil, water or groundwater, to restore the property to a condition imposed by the Environmental

<<<

 Code. Such requirements may have an adverse effect on Prime Living's result or financial position.
Tax risks The Company's operations are affected by the prevailing tax regulations in the jurisdiction in which the Company conducts business

<<<

, which as of the date of the Prospectus only comprises the business in Sweden. These include corporate income tax, real estate tax, value added tax (VAT), rules regarding tax exempt sale of shares, other state and municipal charges and interest

<<<

 rate deductions and contributions. The Company's tax situation is also affected by whether the transactions between companies within the Prime Living group are deemed to be at arm's length. Although the Company's operations are conducted in

<<<

 accordance with the Company's interpretation of applicable tax laws and regulations, and in accordance with the advice from tax advisors, it can not be ruled out that the Company's interpretation is incorrect or that such rules are changed

<<<

, possibly with retroactive effect. Additionally, future changes in applicable laws and regulations may affect the conditions for the Company's operations. There is a risk that the tax rate change in the future or that other rule changes occur

<<<

 that affect ownership of real estate or real estate transactions. Should any of the risks above materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company's operations, result or financial position.
RISKS RELATING TO THE BONDS
Liquidity

<<<

 risks There is a risk that a liquid trading of the Bonds does not occur or cannot be maintained. The Company will apply for listing of the Bonds on Nasdaq Stockholm within 30 days from the Issue Date. Even if a security is admitted to trading

<<<

 there will not always be a demand and trading of the Bonds. This may entail that the Bondholders can not sell their Bonds at a desired time or at price levels which allows for a profit comparable to similar investments that have a higher liquidity

<<<

 in the current trading. Lack of liquidity in the market may have a negative impact on the market value of the Bonds.
The marketprice o f the Bonds may be volatile The market price of the Bonds could be subject to significant fluctuations in

<<<

 response to actual or anticipated variations in the Issuer's and the Group's operating results and those of its competitors, adverse business developments, changes to the regulatory environment in which the Issuer and the Group operates, changes

<<<

 in financial estimates by securities analysts and the actual or expected sale of a large number of Bonds, as well as other factors. In addition, the global financial markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in recent

<<<

 years, which, if repeated in the future, could adversely affect the market price of the Bonds without regard to the Issuer's and the Group's operating results, financial condition or prospects.
Credit risk Bond investors have a credit risk

<<<

 on Prime Living. The investor's ability to receive payment under the Terms and Conditions of the Bonds is therefore dependent on the Company's ability to meet its payment obligations, which in turn is largely dependent on the development of

<<<

 Prime Living's operations and its financial position.
An increased credit risk may cause the market to price the Bonds with a higher risk premium, which would affect the value of the Bonds negatively. Another aspect of the credit risk is that

<<<

 a deterioration of the financial position may cause Prime Living's creditworthiness to decrease and that Prime Living's abilities of debt financing at the end of the duration of the Bond loan deteriorate.
There is no ratingfor the Issuer or

<<<

THE COMPANY AND ITS OPERATIONS
Introduction Prime Living is a creative company that builds and manages student residences

<<<

. The production is unique, with an efficient production method based on steel modules with standardized fast linking strongholds for lifting and shipping, which provides low costs and short production time. Existing inventory and new construction

<<<

 is geographically concentrated to the metropolitan areas and larger university cities where there is a deficiency of student accommodations. The Company is currently in a construction phase and in the medium term the focus will be on new production

<<<

. In the long term the Company believes that it will have strong cash flows combined with the building of about 1,000 modules per year.
History Prime Living was founded in February 2009 in connection to the acquisition of the properties Ferdinand

<<<

 8 and 10 in Spånga, Stockholm. The Company has since then developed a revolutionary concept with a production method based on steel modules with standardized fast linking strongholds for lifting and shipping. Prime Living specializes in utilizing

<<<

 the advantages that comes with prefabrication of residential units and has developed installation and connections on the building site which shortens construction times and minimizes production errors. The company has always strived to control

<<<

 the entire value chain of the modular concept. In line with this, in 2016 Prime Living established a new division, Prime Living Industries. The division handles all aspects of turnkey projects, from design to procurement and construction of

<<<

 residential modules. Prime Living has currently offices in Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö.
Business idea and strategy Prime Livings business idea is to build permanent and temporary residences in the Nordic market with a concept that gives

<<<

 low costs and short production time, and then manage them. Focus lies on student residences and the growth is therefore mainly concentrated to university cities. The Company has a targeted communication to local authorities in order to obtain

<<<

 appropriate assignments of land. Through strategic cooperation with other operators and by using the lower costs of Chinese manufacturers for prefabricated contract manufacturing of residential modules in the factory with a finished concept

<<<

, the costs can be kept down. Another way to keep costs down is to manage the whole production chain which has been implemented by establishing the subsidiary Prime Living Industries. By using standardized shipping and installation in terms

<<<

 of container measurements/fixings, the logistics are highly effective with short lead and establishment time.
Production The residential modules have a steel frame and are produced in an external factory in south of China through a cooperation

<<<

 between Prime Living and state-owned Chinese actors. Prime Living contributes with concept, competence and volume, while the Company's cooperation partners deals with the local production with specially worked out control functions. The system

<<<

 complies in every aspect with building regulations, energy requirements and accessibility rules. At the same time, the production is carried out at a significantly lower cost than in Sweden. Representatives from Prime Living or its general

<<<

 contractor are present during the production to ensure that the quality is in accordance with Swedish standards. The modules are being shipped by boat from China and transported to the most suitable port. In our markets the distances are relatively

<<<

 short between the port and construction site, which means that Prime Living usually can initiate the installation of the modules within a few hours after the arrival of the boat. The modules are provided with so called container feet, which

<<<

 makes shipping, lifting and installation standardized. The installation on site will be carried out by a specialized installation team to minimize construction time, and thus costs. The standardized construction process means in that the installation

<<<

 team repeats the same construction, which makes them highly specialized. The container feet of the modules makes it easy to disassemble and move the modules, which simplifies both reuse of modules and recycling of the steel.
Advantages o f

<<<

 module construction The accommodations are built with module construction, which the Company believes has many advantages.
· FAST - Short project times since the finished modules are transported isolated and fully equipped.
· MOVABLE - The

<<<

 system is fully modular, which means that land with shorter, temporary lease, can be
utilized.
· QUALITY - The prefabrication implies that the quality is ensured in the factory.
14

· STEEL FRAME - The modules are built with special module

<<<

 measurements with a steel frame to withstand shipping and durability requirements.
· EFFECTIVE - Up to now the Company has constructed four story buildings. In coming projects up to twelve stories will be constructed.
· DESIGN - Great opportunities

<<<

 for different expressions. · ENVIRONMENTAL FRIENDLY - The modules are produced with recyclable materials. · ENERGY SOLUTIONS - Heat pumps, wood pellets and district heating. · MEETS REQUIREMENTS - The modules are constructed in accordance with

<<<

 Swedish building
regulations (rules of the National Housing Board). · FINANCE - There are great economic benefits with the project development, as well as the production
time only being four to five months from construction start to finished

<<<

 house. Targets The Company's volume goal is to develop and produce 1,000 modules per year and within four years reach 5,000 modules in management. This will be done with a long term high profitability and with a loan to value ratio of up to

<<<

 75 percent of the market value. The existing portfolio as of the day the Prospectus, including development rights, consists of about 3,200 apartments. Vision The Company's vision is to become one of the leading operators in the student residence

<<<

 market in the Nordic region, with focus also on youth and temporary residences. Mission Prime Livings' mission is to meet the student housing shortage by developing and offering modern student housing at reasonable rents with good profitability

<<<

. The Company's mission is to build 1,000 modules per year and within four years to achieve 5,000 modules under management.
