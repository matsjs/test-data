Risk Factors

Investments in corporate bonds always entail a certain degree of risk and this is also the case for an investment in bonds issued by the Company. A

<<<

 number of factors, both within the Company's control but also factors not controllable by the Company, affect and may come to affect the Company's profit, financial position and the Bonds. A number of risk factors, both general risks attributable

<<<

 to the Company's operations and risks linked directly to the Bonds in their capacity of financial instruments, are described below. The intention is to describe risks that are linked to the Company's business and thus also the Company's ability

<<<

 to fulfil its obligations in accordance with the Terms and Conditions. The below summary of risk factors does not claim to be complete, nor are the risks ranked in order of importance.

Before making a decision about acquisition of the Bonds

<<<

, any potential investors should carefully consider the risk factors described below, as well as any other provided information about the Company and the Bonds. In addition, an investor must, alone or together with its financial and other types

<<<

 of advisers, engage in a general evaluation of external facts, other provided information and general information about the real estate market and real estate companies from its own perspective. An investor should have adequate knowledge to

<<<

 evaluate the risk factors as well as sufficient financial strength to bear these risks.

Additional risk factors which the Company is not currently aware of or that currently is not considered to be material, may also affect the Company's future

<<<

 operations, result and financial position and thus the Company's ability to fulfil its obligations in accordance with the Terms and Conditions.

All risk factors described below potentially may adversely affect the Company's operations, financial

<<<

 position and result. In turn this would affect the Company's ability to fulfil its obligations in accordance with the Terms and Conditions.

1.1

Risks Relating to the Company

1.1.1 Macroeconomic Factors

The real estate business is extensively

<<<

 affected by macroeconomic factors such as the general economic trend, growth, employment, the rate of production of new premises, changes in infrastructure, population growth, inflation and interest rates. The economic growth affects the employment

<<<

 rate which is a factor for the supply and demand on the real estate rental market. In turn this affects the vacancy ratio and rents, especially in terms of commercial real estate.

Expectations regarding the inflation affect the interest rate

<<<

 and therefore affect the Company's net of financial items. The interest cost for debt to financial institutions is one of the Company's main costs items. Changes in interest rate have a significant effect on the Company's long-term result and

<<<

 cash flow. Inflation also affects the Company's costs. In addition, changes in interest rate and inflation also affect the yield requirements and thus the market value of the real estate.

A higher vacancy ratio and interest rates, increased

<<<

 costs and lower rents could have a material adverse effect the Company's business, financial position and result.

1.1.2 Geographical Risks

The supply and demand for real estates and the return on real estate investments differs between different

<<<

 geographical markets and may develop differently within different geographical markets.

4
The Company has a well-diversified real estate portfolio, with its real estate located in different geographical markets. However, there is no guarantee

<<<

 that the demand does not decline on most, or all, of these markets, which could adversely affect the Company's result and financial positions.
1.1.3 Rental Income and Development
If the tenancy ratio or the rents decrease, the Company's result

<<<

 will be adversely affected. The risk of fluctuations in vacancies and loss of rental income increases if a real estate company mainly has few but substantial tenants, which is one reason for the Company not focusing on commercial real estate

<<<

. However, the Company has some substantial tenants and there is no guarantee that these tenants will renew or extend their real estate leases once they elapse. This may in turn lead to a reduced rental income and an increase in vacancies.
The

<<<

 Company is dependent on tenants paying agreed rents as they fall due. There is a risk that tenants do not pay in time, or at all, or fulfil their obligations in general. If so, the Company's result could be adversely affected.
1.1.4 Operational

<<<

 and Maintenance Costs
Operational costs are mainly costs that are tariff-based, such as costs for electricity, cleaning, water and heating. Several of these services may only be bought from one external actor, which may affect the price. When

<<<

 a cost increase is not compensated through regulation of the lease, or an increase in rent by renegotiation of the lease agreement, the Company's result may be adversely affected.
Maintenance expenses are attributable to measures required in

<<<

 order to maintain the standard of the real estate in the long term. These expenses are written off to the extent they relate to reparations or replacements of minor items. Other additional expenses of this character are carried as assets when

<<<

 the expense arises. The Company has an implementation plan for the maintenance actions that are deemed necessary. However, unexpected and extensive needs for renovation may adversely affect the Company. In addition to mere maintenance costs

<<<

, there are normally also costs for tenant adjustments.
1.1.5 Credit Risks
When there is a risk for the Company's counterparties being unable to fulfil their financial obligations towards the Company, there is a credit risk. The Company's current

<<<

 and potential customers may get in a financial situation where they cannot pay the agreed rent as it falls due or otherwise abstain from fulfilling their obligations. Credit risks within the financial operations arise, inter alia, from the

<<<

 investment of excess liquidity, when interest swap agreements are entered into and upon obtaining long- and short-term credit agreements. There are no guarantees that the Company's counterparties can fulfil their obligations.
1.1.6 Interest

<<<

 Rate Risk
Besides equity, the Company's operations are mainly financed by loans from credit institutions. Interest expenses are therefore one of the Company's main costs items. The interest rate risk is defined as the risk that changes in the

<<<

 interest rate affect the Company's interest expenses. The interest expenses are mainly affected by, besides the extent of interest-bearing debts, the level of current market interest rates and the credit institutions' margins and the Company

<<<

's strategy regarding interest rate fixation periods. On 31 March 2012 the Company's average interest rate

5
was 4.91 per cent. on interest-bearing liabilities with security, and the capital was tied-up for an average period of 5.6 years.

<<<

1
The market interest rates are mainly affected by the expected inflation rate. The shorter interest rates in Sweden are mainly affected by The Swedish National Bank's (Sw. Riksbanken) repurchase rate (Sw. reporäntan) which is a monetary policy

<<<

 rate. The Swedish monetary policy intends to keep the inflation at 2 per cent. through adjustments of the repurchase rate. The European Central Bank has a medium term inflation target of close to but below 2 per cent. In times of increasing

<<<

 inflation expectations the interest rate can be expected to rise, and in times with decreasing inflation expectations the interest rate can be expected to fall. A longer average fixed interest term on the Company's loans entails a longer time

<<<

 before a change in the interest rate will have effect on the Company's interest expenses.
1.1.7 Refinancing Risk
The refinancing risk is defined as the risk of not being able to obtain financing at all, or only to significantly higher costs

<<<

. As of 31 March 2012, the Company's interest-bearing debts amounted to SEK 21,385 million.2
As per 31 March 2012, SEK 3,218 million of the interest-bearing debt were comprised of lending from group companies and related parties, and were mostly

<<<

 subordinated in the event of bankruptcy or liquidation. The total unsecured loans amounted to SEK 3,262 million, including SEK 44 million of public bonds.3 Since such loans consist of relending of deposits, the lenders refinancing of such loans

<<<

 are ultimately dependant on lending by the public. There is no guarantee that these lenders will and can continue to provide the financing in the future.
During the financial crisis in 2008-2009 the volatility and disturbances on the financial

<<<

 and credit markets were extreme, with decreased liquidity and increased credit risk premiums for many credit institutions. Even though the Company assesses the refinancing risk as small, there is no guarantee that future refinancing is possible

<<<

 on reasonable terms, which may have a material adverse effect on the Company's operations, financial position and result.
1.1.8 Changes in Value of the Company's Interest Rate Derivatives
Several of the Company's credit agreements include floating

<<<

 interest rates. The Company uses interest rate derivatives, mainly interest rate swaps, to manage the interest rate risk. The interest rate derivatives are reported at fair value in the balance sheet and with changes in value in the profit

<<<

 and loss account. As the market interest rates changes, a theoretical over or under value on the interest rate derivatives occur which, however, does not affect the cash flow. At the end of the term the value of the derivatives is always zero

<<<

. The derivative constitutes a hedging against higher interest rates, but it also means that the market value of the Company's interest rate derivatives decreases if the market interest rates decrease, which in turn has a negative impact on

<<<

 the Company's financial position and result.

<<<

12 ­ 31 March 2012. 3 The consolidated, unaudited interim report of the Company for the period 1 January 2012 ­ 31 March 2012.

6
1.1.9 Changes in Value of the Company's Real Estate
The Company's real estates are reported at fair value in the

<<<

 balance sheet and with changes in value in the profit and loss account. Unrealized changes in value do not affect the cash flow.
The value of the real estate is affected by a number of factors, some of which are real estatespecific such as

<<<

 occupancy ratio and operative expenses whereas others are market-specific such as yield requirements and cost of capital that are derived from comparable transactions on the real estate market.
Different factors may cause the Company to write

<<<

 down the fair value on its real estate, which may adversely affect the Company's result and financial position.
1.1.10 Transactions
All investments involve uncertainties, such as the risks of losing tenants, environmental circumstances and

<<<

 technical problems. Before an investment is made, an evaluation to identify and, if possible, to reduce risks that can be associated with the investment is carried out. However, there are no guarantees that acquired future businesses or real

<<<

 estate will have a positive impact on the Company's result and financial position.
1.1.11 Senior Executives, Staff and Operational Risk
Operational risk is defined as the risk of loss due to insufficient routines and/or other irregularities

<<<

. Adequate internal control mechanisms, appropriate administrative systems, professional development and access to reliable methods of valuation and risk models provide a good foundation to guarantee operational safety. However, the Company

<<<

 cannot guarantee that the measures taken by the Company are adequate and the Company may incur losses if the measures taken by the Company prove to be inadequate.
The Company had 208 employees on 31 March 2012. The knowledge, experience and

<<<

 commitment of these employees is important for the Company's future development. The Company offers very good opportunities for professional development to many of its employees, but the Company would however be adversely affected if several

<<<

 of its employees would decide to leave the Company at the same time or if the Company's administrative security and control functions would fail.
1.1.12 Competition
The Company operates in a competitive sector. The Company's future competitive

<<<

 potential is, amongst other things, dependent on the Company's ability to quickly respond to present and future market needs. Because of this it may become necessary for the Company to make costly investments, restructuring operations or price

<<<

 reductions in order to adapt to a new competition situation. Increased competition could adversely affect the Company's business, financial position and result.
1.1.13 Technical Risks
Real estate investments involve technical risks. A technical

<<<

 risk can be defined as the risk related to the technical operation of the real estate, such as the risk of constructional defects, other latent shortcomings or deficiencies, damages (for instance due to fire or other forces of nature) and pollution

<<<

. If any technical problems should occur it may result in significantly increased costs for the real estate which in turn may adversely affect the Company's financial position and result.

7

1.1.14 Legal Risks

New legislations or regulations

<<<

 or changes regarding the application of existing legislations or regulations, which are applicable on the Company's operations or its clients, may adversely affect the Company's business.

1.1.15 Environmental Risks

Real estate management

<<<

 has environmental impact. The Company has established an environmental policy and is actively working with environmental issues.

Everyone whose operations have contributory caused pollution is responsible for after-treatment according to the

<<<

 Swedish Environmental Code. If an operator is not able to carry out or pay for the after-treatment of a polluted property, the person who acquired the property and was aware of the pollution at the time of acquisition or ought to have detected

<<<

 it then shall be liable for aftertreatment. This means that demands of soil decontamination or after-treatment, due to existing or suspected soil, surface water or ground water pollution in certain circumstances may be directed against the

<<<

 Company in order to set the real estate in such condition that is required by the Swedish Environmental Code. Such demands may adversely affect the Company's business and result. The Company has not performed a complete investigation regarding

<<<

 possible environmental pollution amongst the real estate portfolio.

1.1.16 Tax Risks

Changes in corporate income tax and real estate tax, as well as other fiscal charges and contributions, may affect the conditions for the Company's operations

<<<

. There are no guarantees that these fiscal charges and contributions will remain unchanged in the future. The corporate income taxation is subject to frequent changes why it cannot be excluded that tax rates may change in the future. Neither

<<<

 can it be excluded that other changes are made to the legal systems which affects the real estate ownership. Changes to corporate income tax and other fiscal charges may adversely affect the Company's business and result.

A change in tax legislation

<<<

, custom or jurisprudence which, for example, means altered corporate tax rate or altered possibilities for depreciation for tax purposes can lead to a future change of the Company's tax position.

1.1.17 Disputes

The Company is involved in

<<<

 a number of minor disputes, none of which could materially affect the Company's operations, financial position and result. It cannot be excluded that the Company will become involved in other disputes in the future. A negative outcome of a

<<<

 dispute could adversely affect the Company's business, financial position and result.

1.2

Risks Related to the Bond Issue

Bond loans may contain elements which confer specific risks for investors. The Bonds carry a relatively high interest

<<<

 rate which should be regarded as a compensation for the relatively high risk carried by investors compared to, for example, government bonds.

1.2.1 Liquidity Risks

The Company cannot guarantee that a liquid trading in the Bonds occur and

<<<

 is maintained. The company will apply for registration of the Bonds at the Corporate Bond List at OMX.

8
Even though a security is admitted for trading on a regulated market, there may not always be a demand for, and trade with, that security

<<<

. This can result in that a bondholder may be unable to sell its Bonds at a desired time or to a return which is comparable to similar investments which have an existing and functioning secondary market. Lack of liquidity in the market may adversely

<<<

 affect the market value of the Bonds.
1.2.2 Credit Risk
Investors in the Bonds have a credit risk in relation to the Company. An investor's opportunity to obtain payment under the Terms and Conditions is therefore dependent on the Company's

<<<

 ability to meet its payment obligations. The Company's ability to meet its payment obligations is in turn, to a large extent, dependent on the development of the Company's operations and financial position. The Company's financial position

<<<

 is affected by a number of risk factors, of which some have been described above. An increase in credit risk may cause the market to price the Bonds with a higher risk premium, which could adversely affect the Bonds' value.
Another aspect of

<<<

 the credit risk is that a decreased financial position may lead to a decrease in the Company's credit rating which may lead to a decrease in the Company's possibilities to finance itself through loans around the time of maturity of the Bonds

<<<

. The credit risk should ultimately be considered with respect to the market value of the real estate portfolio in the event of a sale. The Company's ambition is that its collective debts shall not exceed 70 per cent. of the book value of the

<<<

 Company's real estate.
1.2.3 Preferential Right
The Company has, as part of its financing, incurred debts to credit institutions. Certain real estate and share certificates in the Company's real estate owning subsidiaries have in connection

<<<

 therewith been pledged as security. Such loans normally constitute a preferential claim on the Company. The Company intends to continue seeking appropriate and profitable financing why further pledges, as part of such new loans, may be provided

<<<

.
The Bonds represent an unsecured obligation of the Company. This means that in the event of the Company's liquidation, company reorganisation or bankruptcy the bondholders normally receive payment after any prioritised creditors, which usually

<<<

 have security over certain assets, have been fully paid. Every investor should be aware that by investing in the Bonds, it risks losing the entire, or parts of, its investment in the event of the Company's liquidation, bankruptcy or company

<<<

 reorganisation.
1.2.4 Euroclear
The Bonds are connected to Euroclear's account-based system, why no physical notes have been or will be issued. Clearing and settlement relating to the Bonds, as well as payment of interest and redemption of

<<<

 principal amounts, will be performed within Euroclear's account-based system. The investors are therefore dependant on the functionality of Euroclear's account-based system.
1.2.5 Bondholders' Meeting
The Terms and Conditions include certain

<<<

 conditions regarding bondholders' meetings. Such meeting may be held in order to resolve on matters relating to the bondholders' interests. The Terms and Conditions allow for stated majorities to bind all bondholders, including bondholders

<<<

 who have not partaken in or voted at the actual meeting or who have voted differently than the

9
required majority, to decisions that have been taken at a duly convened and conducted bondholders' meeting.

The Bonds in Brief

This Section contains a general and broad description of the Bonds. It does not claim to be comprehensive or cover all details

<<<

 of the Bonds. Potential investors should therefore carefully consider this Prospectus as a whole, including documents incorporated by reference, before a decision is made to invest in the Bonds. The full terms of the Bonds can be found in Section

<<<

 6 below.

Concepts and terms defined in Section 6 are used with the same meaning in this summary unless otherwise is explicitly understood from the context.

3.1

Summary of the Bonds

The Bonds are debt instruments (Sw. skuldförbindelser)

<<<

, intended for public market trading, which confirm that the holder has a claim on the Company. The issue of the Bonds was resolved upon and this Prospectus was approved by the Company's board of directors on 20 April 2012 and 9 July 2012, respectively

<<<

. The issue date for the Bonds was 25 June 2012 and the Bonds will mature on 25 June 2015 (the Final Redemption Date).

The Bonds constitute direct, unsecured, unconditional and unsubordinated obligations of the Company. The net proceeds of

<<<

 the bond issue shall be used by the Group for general corporate purposes.

The bond loan amounts to maximum SEK one billion (1,000,000,000), represented by Bonds denominated in SEK and with ISIN SE0004649739, each of a nominal amount of SEK

<<<

 one million (1,000,000). The Bonds were issued at a price equal to 100.00 per cent. of the Nominal Amount. As of the date of this Prospectus, SEK 420,000,000 of the bond loan has been issued.

The Bonds have been issued in accordance with Swedish

<<<

 law and are connected to the accountbased system of Euroclear, meaning that the Bonds are registered on behalf of the Holders on a Securities Account. No physical notes have been or will be issued. Payment of principal, interest and, if applicable

<<<

, withholding of preliminary tax will be made through Euroclear's book-entry system.

The Company shall redeem all outstanding Bonds at the Nominal Amount together with accrued interest on the Final Redemption Date, unless previously redeemed

<<<

, pre-paid or repurchased and cancelled in accordance with Section 8 (Early redemption by request of the Company), Section 11 (The Group Companies' purchase of Bonds), Section 13 (Acceleration of the Bonds) or Section 14 (Change of control and

<<<

 Listing Failure) of the Terms and Conditions. Payment in respect of principal and interest shall be made to the person who is a Holder on the Record Date immediately preceding the relevant payment date. The right to receive payment of the Nominal

<<<

 Amount is timebarred and becomes void ten years from the relevant redemption date.

The Bonds bear interest from, but excluding, the Issue Date up to, and including, the Redemption Date at a floating interest rate of STIBOR (3 months) increased

<<<

 with 475 basis points. The interest is paid quarterly in arrears on each Interest Payment Date and is calculated on an actual/360-days basis. The Interest Payments Dates are 25 December, 25 March, 25 June and 25 September each year (with the

<<<

 first Interest Payment Date being 25 September 2012 and the last Interest Payment Date being the Final Redemption Date). The right to receive payment of interest is time-barred and becomes void three years from the relevant due date for payment

<<<

. Interest calculations will be made by the Bond Trustee.

12
Swedish Trustee AB is initially acting as Bond Trustee in relation to the Bonds. Even without separate authorisation from the Holders and without having to obtain any Holder's consent

<<<

 (if not required to do so under the Terms and Conditions), the Bond Trustee, or a person appointed by the Bond Trustee, is entitled to represent the Holders in every matter concerning the Bonds and the Terms and Conditions and is authorised

<<<

 to act on behalf of the Holders whether in court or before an executive authority (including any legal or arbitration proceeding relating to the perfection, preservation, protection or enforcement of the Bonds). Each Holder shall immediately

<<<

 upon request by the Bond Trustee provide the Bond Trustee with any such documents, including a written power of attorney (in form and substance to the Bond Trustee's satisfaction), which the Bond Trustee deems necessary for the purpose of carrying

<<<

 out its duties under the Terms and Conditions and the other Finance Documents. The Bond Trustee is under no obligation to represent a Holder which does not comply with such a request of the Bond Trustee.
Each of the Company, the Bond Trustee

<<<

 and Holders representing at least 10 per cent. of the total outstanding Nominal Amount, may at any time request that a Holders' meeting is convened or request a procedure in writing among the Holders, see further Section 16 (Holders' meeting

<<<

 and procedure in writing) of the Terms and Conditions. Such meetings or procedures in writing can lead to that a majority decision, binding for all Holders, is being passed.
The Bonds are freely transferable and trading can occur from the Issue

<<<

 Date. Holders may however be subject to purchase or transfer restrictions with regard to the Bonds, as applicable from time to time under local laws to which a Holder may be subject (due to e.g. its nationality, its residency, its registered

<<<

 address or its place(s) for business). Each Holder must ensure compliance with local laws and regulations applicable at own cost and expense.
The Bonds have been issued through a so called private placement where the Bonds have been offered

<<<

 to and acquired by a limited number of institutional and other investors.
To simplify the trade in the Bonds, the Company intends to apply for listing of the Bonds at the Corporate Bond List on OMX in connection with the Swedish Financial Supervisory

<<<

 Authority's approval of this Prospectus. That an application regarding listing of the Bonds on OMX has been submitted to OMX does however not mean that the application will be approved. If the Bonds have not been listed on OMX within sixty

<<<

 (60) days of the Issue Date, each Holder has a right of pre-payment of the Bonds at a price of 100.00 per cent. of the Nominal Amount. If the Bonds are listed on OMX, the Terms and Conditions include an undertaking for the Company to take all

<<<

 measures required to ensure that the Bonds continue being listed on OMX for as long as any Bond is outstanding. The expenses of the admission to trading are estimated to amount to SEK 38,000 in relation to the Swedish Financial Supervisory

<<<

 Authority, SEK 13,000 in relation to OMX and fees to advisors.

Company Description

4.1

The Company's Operations

The Company, Akelius Fastigheter AB (publ), with reg. no. 556156-0383 was formed on 9 August 1971 and was registered

<<<

 in Sweden on 29 December 1971. Its trade name (i.e. the name used for marketing purposes) is Akelius Fastigheter. The Company is a public limited liability company and is regulated by the Swedish Companies Act (Sw. aktiebolagslagen (2005:5

<<<

51)). The registered office of the Company is in the municipality of Danderyd and the Company's registered address is Box 104, 182 12 Danderyd, Sweden.

According to the Company's articles of association, adopted on 19 April 2012, the objects

<<<

<<<

 to terminate has ceased.

<<<

 later than sixty (60) days after the Company notified the Bond Trustee and the Holders (the "Exercise Period"). Bonds held by a Holder who has exercised the Put Option shall be blocked from transactions. To that end the Holder shall transfer

<<<

<<<

<<<

 not made public to the Holders.

<<<

 Bonds of the requesting Holders. The request shall clearly state that the matter is urgent. If the Bond Trustee establishes that a request for a Holders' meeting or procedure in writing has been duly made, the Bond Trustee shall, within twenty

<<<

 (20) Banking Days from the receipt of such request, convene a meeting or initiate a procedure in writing. The Bond Trustee is not required to convene a Holders' meeting or initiate a procedure if the Bond Trustee determines that (i) the proposal

<<<

 must be approved by the Company and the Company informs the Bond

42
Trustee that it will not give such approval, (ii) the proposal is not in accordance with applicable laws, or (iii) it appears highly unlikely that the Holders' meeting or

Holders' meeting (or, in case of a procedure in writing, through calculation by the Bond Trustee of the replies), at which each Holder entitled to vote shall have one vote per Bond at

<<<

 a Nominal Amount of SEK one million (1,000,000) held. A Holder must vote in the same manner for all Bonds held. However, a representative who represents different Holders may vote differently for different Holders. Bonds held by a Group Company

<<<

 shall not carry any voting right. The resolution of the Holders shall be in accordance with the opinion held by the majority of the Nominal Amount of the Bonds represented at the meeting (or, in case of a procedure in writing, received answers

<<<

(e) Quorum exists only if Holders representing at least one fifth (1/5) of the aggregate outstanding Nominal Amount attend the

<<<

 meeting in due order (or, in case of a procedure in writing, provide replies). Bonds held by a Group Company shall not be considered when calculating whether necessary majority has been achieved. If quorum is not achieved within fifteen (1

<<<

5) minutes from the fixed time (or, in case of a procedure in writing, through received answers at the end of the reply period), the meeting shall be adjourned (or, in case of a procedure in writing, the time for replies shall be extended) to

<<<

 the tenth Banking Day thereafter. Notice containing information regarding time and place for a continued meeting (or, in case of a procedure in writing, information regarding extended period for replies) shall promptly be provided to the Holders

<<<

 in

44
accordance with Section 20. At a continued meeting (or, in case of a procedure in writing, at a new calculation) a resolution can be passed through an ordinary resolution (or, if required in accordance with (c) above, through Qualified

<<<

. The chairman shall further arrange for minutes to be kept at the meeting. The minutes shall include the Voting List (which shall be approved by the Holders' meeting), any other persons that have been attending, what has been discussed, the

<<<

 result of the voting and the resolutions that were passed. The minutes shall be signed by the chairman and by at least one person appointed by the meeting to verify the minutes. In case of a procedure in writing, the Bond Trustee shall provide

<<<

 for the calculation of votes and keep minutes in respect of the calculation of votes and the resolutions passed by the procedure in writing. The Bond Trustee may request supplements and clarifications but is not obliged to do so and may disregard

<<<

 any unclear or illegible votes. The Bond Trustee shall disregard any answers that deviate from the listed alternatives or from an alleged Holder whose voting right is not apparent from the documentation provided by the Holder or CSD. The Company

<<<

 may be represented at the calculation. The

45
minutes shall be finalized promptly and be held available for the Holders at the Company and the Bond Trustee.
(h) If the Company and the Bond Trustee deem appropriate, a Holders' meeting may

<<<

<<<

 that deviate from listed alternatives (in a resolution form or otherwise) will be disregarded in accordance with Section (g) above.
(j) A resolution that has been passed at a duly convened and held meeting or a procedure in writing is binding

<<<

 for all Holders irrespective of whether they have been present or represented at the meeting or if they have participated in the procedure in writing and irrespective of how and if they have voted. No Holder shall be liable for any damages

<<<

 caused to any other Holder due to a resolution being or not being passed at the Holders' meeting.
(k) If the Bond Trustee, in breach of these Terms and Conditions, has not convened a Holders' meeting within twenty (20) Banking Days after having

<<<
