 time of the Agent's declaration. However, if a moratorium occurs, the ending of that moratorium will not prevent termination for payment prematurely on the ground mentioned in Clause 14.1 (e).

<<<

 Stockholm or otherwise, the Issuer shall however be obligated to either seek the approval from NASDAQ OMX Stockholm or undertake other reasonable measures, including entering into a non-disclosure agreement with the Agent, in order to be able

<<<

 a right of termination and obtain instructions from the Holders according to the provisions in Clause 16 (.Decisions by Holders). If the Holders vote in favour of termination and instruct the Agent to terminate the Bonds, the Agent shall promptly

<<<

 declare the Bonds terminated. However, if the cause for termination according to the Agent's appraisal has ceased before the termination, the Agent shall not terminate the Bonds. The Agent shall in such case, at the earliest possible date,
