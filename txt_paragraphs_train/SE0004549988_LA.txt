Risk factors
All investments in bonds involve a degree of risk. The financial performance of KGH Customs and

<<<

 the risks associated with KGH Customs' business are important when making a decision on whether to invest in the Bonds. A number offactors influence and could influence KGH Customs' operations andfinancial performance and ultimately the Company

<<<

's ability to make interest payments and payments ofprincipal on maturity. In this Section a number of riskfactors are illustrated and discussed, both general risks pertaining to KGH Customs' operations and material risks related to the Bonds

<<<

 as a financial instrument. The Section aims at describing the risks associated with KGH Customs' operations and by that also the Company's ability tofulfil its obligations according to the terms and conditionsfor the Bonds. The riskfactors

<<<

 below are not ranked in order of importance and no claim is being made that the list is exhaustive.
Potential investors should carefully consider the riskfactors below and other information in this Prospectus before deciding on making an investment

<<<

 in the Bonds. An investor must, in addition, alone or together with financial and/or other advisors, consider the general business prospects, other information in the Prospectus and general information about the applicable market and companies

<<<

 active on that market, based on their personal circumstances. An investor should possess sufficient knowledge to assess the risk factors and sufficientfinancial strength to bear those risks.
Additional riskfactors that are not currently known

<<<

 or not currently considered to be material may also affect KGH Customs'future operations, performance andfinancial position, and consequently the Company's ability to meet its obligations under the terms and conditionsfor the Bonds.
Risks related

<<<

 to KGH C ustom s' business operation
Business and market related risks
Political risks
KGH Customs operates in a number of countries where political instability may lead to a slowdown in levels for origination in that particular country. An

<<<

 increased political instability in any country where KGH Customs operates may have a material adverse effect on KGH Customs' business and its financial condition or may even require KGH Customs to change or discontinue existing products, services

<<<

, businesses or business models in the affected region.
Organizational risks and operational risks
KGH Customs' operations are dependent on individual employees. KGH Customs' future development depends to a large extent on the management's and

<<<

 other key personnel's knowledge, experience and commitment. KGH Customs' development may therefore be adversely affected if any key personnel would resign from its assignment.
In the context of KGH Customs' current operations, KGH Customs may

<<<

 incur losses due to disruption, failure or other ineffectiveness of procedures, internal control or reporting or administrative systems used in its operations. Lack of procedures and lack of internal control may lead to that the management

<<<

 loses control over corporate governance, which would cause KGH Customs harm.
The Company is a holding company
The Company is a holding company and holds no significant assets other than investments in the subsidiaries. The Company is thus dependent

<<<

 upon receipt of sufficient income related to the operation of

4
and the ownership in its subsidiaries. A decrease in any such income may have a material adverse effect on the Group's financial condition, results of operations and ability

<<<

 to meet financial obligations.
Norwegian EU membership or altered trade treaties between Norway and the EU
The main part of KGH Customs' earnings is generated due to that all trade between Norway and the countries in the EU require documentation

<<<

 and is subject to duty and VAT calculation on a shipment level. For each shipment that is exported from or imported to Norway, extensive information has to be communicated electronically to both the customs authority in Norway and in the relevant

<<<

 EU country. A Norwegian EU membership would impact KGH Customs adversely as the need for declarations handling for Norwegian companies would drastically fall.
If the trade treaty between Norway and the EU (the EEA agreement) would change resulting

<<<

 in that the current contractual arrangements would loosen up, the impact would resemble the impact of a Norwegian EU membership, effectively taking out the customs border between Norway and the countries in the EU.
Geographical concentration

<<<


According to the Group's unaudited consolidated financial report for the financial period ended 30 September 2012, the Group's business in Sweden and Norway jointly corresponded to approximately 70% of the Group's total revenues and an even

<<<

 greater share of profits. However, there is no guarantee that the demand for the Group's services in Sweden and Norway does not decline on one or both of these markets, which could adversely affect the Group's result and financial position

<<<

.
Ability to comply with the terms and conditions for the Bonds
According to the terms and conditions for the Bonds, the Company shall to ensure that the Group maintains certain specified financial ratios and that it satisfies certain financial

<<<

 covenants, including covenants related to interest coverage and net debt. Events beyond the Company's control, including changes in the economic and business conditions in which the Company operates, may affect the ability to comply with such

<<<

 ratios and covenants. The Company cannot assure that the Group will meet the ratios or satisfy the covenants. A breach of any of the covenants in, or the inability to maintain the required financial ratios under, the terms and conditions for

<<<

 the Bonds could result in that an event of default occurs under the terms and conditions for the Bonds. In addition, the terms and conditions for the Bonds contain a cross-default provision on financial indebtedness subject to a carve-out of

<<<

 SEK 5,000,000 or its equivalent amount in any other currency. A violation of the cross-default provision constitutes an event of default under the terms and conditions for the Bonds. The occurrence of an event of default under the terms and

<<<

 conditions for the Bonds would, unless waived, provide a right to accelerate the outstanding debt, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. Such payment obligation could correspond to the value of all or substantially

<<<

 all of KGH Customs' assets.
Ability to service debt
The Group's ability to service its debt will depend upon, among other things, the Group's future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions

<<<

 and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond the Group's control. If the Group's operating income is not sufficient to service its current or future indebtedness, the Group will be forced to take actions such

<<<

 as reducing or delaying its business activities, acquisitions, investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing its debt or seeking additional equity capital. The Group may not be able to affect any of these

<<<

 remedies on satisfactory terms, or at all.
VAT related risk

5
A part of the Group's income (approximately 8% of the turnover1) is related to the segment financial services. The segment financial services is carried out in the Nordic countries

<<<

 and include services provided in relation to customs duties and VAT related to import declarations and guarantees provided in relation to transit declarations. Approximately one third of the financial services provided by the Group relate to

<<<

 VAT.
Currently, a Directive relating to VAT on imported goods is implemented by the Member States of the European Union. Depending on how the Member States choose to implement the Directive, the Group's business, and financial income, related

<<<

 to VAT may be negatively affected. This risk is mainly applicable to Sweden and in the beginning of 2013 a proposal was put forward to the ministry of finance regarding changes in the present system for handling of import VAT in Sweden. If

<<<

 this proposal is accepted it will impact KGH business negatively, the yearly loss in turnover is calculated to approximately SEK 6m to SEK 7m per year effective from 2015. Guarantees
A part of KGH Customs' activities consists of handling and

<<<

 paying customs duties and VAT on behalf of its customers in relation to the national customs authorities and to take on guarantee responsibilities towards the national customs authorities. To be able to obtain credits - deferment accounts 

<<<

- with national customs authorities for handling of customs duties and VAT and to be able to take on responsibilities for transit procedures, the Group is required to present statutory guarantees to the pertinent authority. To be accepted by

<<<

 customs, the guarantees have to be issued by an approved financial institute. Ordinary bank guarantees are most common, but guarantees issued by insurance companies and similar institutions are also being used. At present, KGH Customs has a

<<<

 mix of guarantees issued by the Group's bank (SEB) and by the project insurance company Nordic Guarantee and the insurance company Artradius However, there is always a risk that KGH Customs cannot receive guarantees from an approved financial

<<<

 institute on reasonable terms.
Risks relating to KGH Customs' counterparties
Counterparty risk refer to the risk that KGH Customs' counterparties will not live up to their contractual obligations.
As mentioned above, a part of KGH Customs'

<<<

 activities consists of paying customs duties and VAT on behalf of its customers to the national customs authorities. Normally, KGH Customs will demand prepayment or a bank guarantee from its customers to cover such costs. For some large trustworthy

<<<

 companies (typical listed companies) KGH on a regular basis handle their VAT and duties which can amount to substantial amounts without upfront payments or guarantees, this if of course a risk, but the yearly losses for this business are low

<<<

.
In relation to merchandise in transit, the Group takes on a guarantee responsibility towards the national customs authorities. During the transit, the issuer has to present a guarantee for customs duties if the goods should disappear during

<<<

 the transport. An average transport under transit is only a couple of days. The guarantee is opened day one and is then closed a couple of days later. Should the goods disappear during transport, the national customs authority will demand payment

<<<

 for the customs duties from the guarantor, i.e. KGH Customs, in accordance with the guarantee. There is always a risk that KGH Customs is not repaid by its customers for such costs.
Risks related to taxes
The Company operates its business through

<<<

 its subsidiaries in each of the geographic markets in which it operates. The business is conducted in accordance with KGH Customs' interpretation of applicable laws, tax treaties, regulations and requirements of the tax authorities in the relevant

<<<

 countries. However, it is not
1 Note: Information based on KGH internal unaudited Management Accounts for the twelve months period ended 31 December 2011

6
certain that KGH Customs' interpretation of applicable laws, tax treaties, regulations

<<<

, or administrative practice is correct, or that such rules are not changed, possibly with retroactive effect. Legislative changes or decisions by tax authorities may impair the present or previous tax position of KGH Customs and may have a

<<<

 material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations.
Financial risks
The Company is, through its subsidiaries' activities, exposed to financial risks such as risks relating to currency risk, exchange rate fluctuations

<<<

 as well as liquidity and refinancing risk.
Currency risk
The Company's functional currency is SEK. Although the Group's primary operations and cash flows are typically denominated in SEK, the Group has operations and costs that are not denominated

<<<

 in SEK. These include Euro ("EUR"), Norwegian Krone ("NOK") and Danish Krone ("DKK"). The Group may undertake hedging activities against these potential fluctuations; however, there are no assurances that hedging strategies, if implemented

<<<

, would be successful. Exchange rate fluctuations
Fluctuations in exchange rates can have an impact on the Group's financial results in the event that the EUR, NOK and/or DKK (or any other currency in which the Group's costs might be incurred

<<<

 in the future) appreciate significantly against the SEK. Significant strengthening of these currencies against the SEK could increase both capital and operating costs, although where sales prices are denominated in local currency, there may

<<<

 be a mitigating increase in revenue. Liquidity and refinancing risks
Liquidity and refinancing risks refer to that costs may increase and that opportunities may be limited when loans are refinanced, and that payment obligations may not be met

<<<

 due to insufficient liquidity or difficulties in obtaining financing.
Risks relating to the Bonds
Credit risks
Investors in the Bonds carry a credit risk relating to the Company. The investor's ability to receive payment under the terms and

<<<

 conditions for the Bonds is therefore dependent on the Company's ability to meet its payment obligations, which in turn is largely dependent upon the performance of the Company's operations and its financial position. The Company's financial

<<<

 position is affected by several factors of which a number have been discussed above.
An increased credit risk may cause the market to charge the Bonds a higher risk premium, which would affect the Bonds' value negatively. Another aspect of

<<<

 the credit risk is that a deteriorating financial position of the Company may reduce the Company's possibility to receive debt financing at the time of the maturity of the Bonds.
Interest rate risks
The Bonds' value depends on several factors

<<<

, one of the most significant over time being the level of market interest. Investments in the Bonds involve a risk that the market value of the Bonds may be adversely affected by changes in market interest rates.
Liquidity risks

7
The Company

<<<

 cannot guarantee that a liquid market for trading in the Bonds will occur and that such trading is maintained. The Company will apply for registration of the Bonds at the corporate bond list on Nasdaq OMX Stockholm in connection with the approval

<<<

 of this Prospectus by the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority. Even if securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market, active trading in the securities does not always occur. This may result in that the holders cannot sell their

<<<

 Bonds when desired or at a price level which allows for a profit comparable to similar investments with an active and functioning secondary market. Lack of liquidity in the market may have a negative impact on the market value of the Bonds

<<<

. Furthermore, the nominal value of the Bonds may not be indicative comparing to the market price of the Bonds if the Bonds are admitted for trading at the corporate bond list on Nasdaq OMX Stockholm.
It should also be noted that during a given

<<<

 time period it may be difficult or impossible to sell the Bonds due to, for example, severe price fluctuations, close down of the relevant market or trade restrictions imposed on the market.
Risks relating to the clearing and settlement in

<<<

 Euroclear's book-entry system
The Bonds are affiliated to Euroclear Sweden AB's ( 'Euroclear') account-based system, why no physical notes have been, or will be, issued. Clearing and settlement relating to the Bonds is carried out within Euroclear

<<<

's book-entry system as well as payment of interest and repayment of the principal. Investors are therefore dependent on the functionality of Euroclear's account-based system.
Preferential rights
Subject to possible restrictions in the terms

<<<

 and conditions for the Bonds, the Company may in the future decide to take up loans from banks or other credit institutions and to issue other market loans. Such loans may constitute a priority claim on the Company.
The Bonds represent an unsecured

<<<

 obligation of the Company. This means that in the event of bankruptcy, re-organization or wind-up of the Company, the holders of the Bonds normally receive payment after any priority creditors have been fully paid.
Each investor should be aware

<<<

 that there is a risk that an investor in the Bonds loses all or part of their investment if the Company becomes bankrupt, carries out a re-organization or is wound-up.
Amended or new legislation
This Prospectus and the terms and conditions

<<<

 for the Bonds are based on Swedish law in force at the date of this Prospectus. No assurance can be given on the impact of any possible future legislative measures or changes or modifications to administrative practices.
Risks related to early

<<<

 redemption
The Company has, under the terms and conditions for the Bonds, reserved the possibility to redeem all outstanding Bonds before the final redemption date. If the Bonds are redeemed before the final redemption date, the holders have

<<<

 the right to receive an early redemption amount which exceeds the nominal amount. However, there is a risk that the market value of the Bonds is higher than the early redemption amount.

Concepts and terms defined in the Section "Terms and Conditionsfor

<<<

 the Bonds" or anywhere else in the Prospectus are used with the same meaning in the summary unless otherwise is explicitly understoodfrom the context.
Summary of the Bonds
The Bonds are debt instruments, intended for public market trading,

<<<

<<<

<<<

 repay certain shareholder loans, to repay certain bank loans, to pay the transaction costs in relation to the Bond Issue and for general corporate purposes.
The Bonds are denominated in SEK. The bond loan amounts to SEK 400,000,000, represented

<<<

 by Bonds, each of a nominal amount of SEK one million (1,000,000), is denominated in SEK and the ISIN is SE0004549988. The total amount of securities being admitted to trading is 400.
The Bonds have been issued in accordance with Swedish law

<<<

 and are connected to the account-based system of Euroclear, meaning that the Bonds are registered on behalf of the Holders on a Securities Account. No physical notes have been or will be issued. Payment of principal and interest as well as

<<<

, if applicable, withholding of preliminary tax will be made through Euroclear.
The Company shall redeem all outstanding Bonds at the Nominal Amount together with accrued interest on the Final Redemption Date, unless previously redeemed, pre

<<<

-paid or repurchased and cancelled in accordance with Section 8 (Early redemption by request of the Company), Section 11 (The Company's and the other Group Companies'purchase of Bonds), Section 14 (Acceleration of the Bonds) or Section 15 (Change

<<<

 of control) of the terms and conditions for the Bonds. Payment in respect of principal and interest shall be made to the Holders on the relevant Record Date. The right to receive payment of the Nominal Amount is time-barred and becomes void

<<<

 ten years from the relevant redemption date.
The Bonds bear interest from, but excluding, the Issue Date up to, and including, the Redemption Date at an interest rate of 9.0% per annum. The interest is paid in arrears on each Interest Payment

<<<

 Date and is calculated on a 30/360-days basis. Interest Payment Dates are 23 November and 23 May each year. The right to receive payment of interest is time-barred and becomes void three years from the relevant due date for payment. Interest

<<<

 calculations will be made by Euroclear.
Swedish Trustee AB (publ) is initially acting as the Company's Bond Trustee under the terms and conditions for the Bonds. Even without a separate authorization from the Holders, the Bond Trustee, or a

<<<

 person appointed by the Bond Trustee, is entitled to represent the Holders against the Company in every matter concerning the Bonds, whether or not in court or before an executive authority. Further, each Holder shall

10
immediately upon

<<<

 request by the Bond Trustee provide the Bond Trustee with any such documents, including a written power of attorney, which the Bond Trustee deems necessary for the purpose of carrying out its duties under the terms and conditions for the Bonds

<<<

.
Each of the Company, the Bond Trustee and Holders representing 10% of the total outstanding Nominal Amount may, at any time, request that a Holders' meeting is convened or request a procedure in writing amongst the Holders, see further Section

<<<

 16 (The Bond Trustee's right to represent the Holders, the authority of the Bond Trustee etc.) and Section 17 (Holders' meetings and procedure in writing) of the terms and conditions of the Bonds. Such meetings or procedures in writing can

<<<

 lead to a majority decision, binding for all Holders, is being passed.
The Bonds are freely transferable and trading can occur from the Issue Date.
The Bonds have been issued on the Swedish market through a so called private placement. No Bonds

<<<

 have been issued, or will be issued, after 22 May 2012 and the bond loan was subscribed in full on the Issue Date.
To simplify the trade in the Bonds, the Company intends to apply for listing of the Bonds at the corporate bond list on Nasdaq

<<<

 OMX Stockholm in connection with the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority's approval of this Prospectus. Further, the terms and conditions for the Bonds include an undertaking to list the Bonds not later than one year after the Issue Date

<<<

, see further Section 12 (Special undertakings) of the terms and conditions for the Bonds. The fact that an application regarding listing of the Bonds on Nasdaq OMX Stockholm has been submitted to Nasdaq OMX Stockholm does however not mean that

<<<

 the application will be approved. The procedure of first issuing all Bonds and then listing the Bonds at the corporate bond list on Nasdaq OMX Stockholm has been chosen for efficiency reasons.
The total expenses of the admission to trading

<<<

 are estimated to amount to SEK 196,000.

Financial overview
The Company acquired all shares in KGH Group in May 2012. Prior to the

<<<

 Acquisition, the Company did not carry out any activities and did not publish any financial reports. Therefore, the only financial report published by the Company is the unaudited financial report for KGH Customs for the period ended 30 September

<<<

 2012. However, as the Acquisition did not result in any major changes to the group than the new parent company, the Company has chosen to include KGH Group AB's annual reports for the fiscal years 2010 - 2011 in the Prospectus to give the reader

<<<

 an illustration of the Groups financial history reference (see "Documents incorporated by reference"). To illustrate the effect of the Acquisition on the accounts, the Company has also chosen to include unaudited pro forma financial information

<<<

 (the "Proforma") in the Prospectus. The auditors have examined the Proforma in accordance with the auditor's report set out on page 26. Further, the unaudited financial report for KGH Customs for the period ended 30 September 2012 is included

<<<

 in the Prospectus (see "Documents incorporated by reference").
Prior to the Acquisition, KGH Group reported its group accounts in accordance with Swedish Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("SGAAP") which includes the Swedish Annual Accounts

<<<

 Act (Sw. årsredovisningslagen), and the Swedish Financial Accounting Standards Council's recommendations and issued statements (Sw. allmänna råd från Bokföringsnämnden avseende större företag). After the acquisition the Company's group accounts

<<<

 are prepared and reported in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), and interpretations of these standards (IFRICs) issued by the IFRS Interpretations

<<<

 Committee, as these IFRSs and IFRICs have been adopted by the EU for application within the EU. To demonstrate significant differences between the accounting standards used previously by KGH Group and the accounting standards used by the Company

<<<

, a comparison has been included in the Proforma (which has been prepared in accordance with IFRS).

 information in accordance with IFRS
The information in this Section should be read together with KGH Group 's audited financial statements, including notes, the Auditor's reports and other supplemental information, for the fiscal years 201

<<<

0 - 2011 and KGH Customs' unaudited interim financial statements for the nine-month period ending on 30 September 2012 (see "Documents incorporated by reference").
Purpose of the Proforma
Provided in this Section is the Proforma, prepared in

<<<

 accordance with IFRS for the year-to-date ending on 30 September 2012. The purpose of the Proforma is to illustrate the effects of the acquisition by the Company of KGH Group (in this Prospectus referred to as the "Acquisition"). The Acquisition

<<<

 was completed on 24 May 2012 and was financed by the Bond Issue and by the issue of new shares in the Company. The Acquisition is considered to have a substantial effect on the balance sheet and the income statements of KGH Customs.
The comparison

<<<

 between SGAAP and the Proforma (prepared in accordance with IFRS) is provided to demonstrate where significant differences exist between these accounting standards as applied to KGH Customs' accounts as well as the effect of the Acquisition

<<<

.
The Proforma does not intend to reflect the results or financial position which would have occurred if the transaction was carried out on the specified date. Further, the Proforma is not necessarily indicative for the future results or financial

<<<

 position of the Group.
Proforma assumptions etcetera
As previously stated, KGH Customs has never published an annual report. Therefore, the Proforma has been prepared in accordance with IFRS to reflect the principles which will be applied by

<<<

 the Company in the annual report for 2012.
The source of the financial information on which the Proforma is based is the unaudited financial information for KGH Customs for the period ended 30 September 2012. In order to keep comparability

<<<

 between the Proforma before the Acquisition on 24 May 2012 and the Proforma after this date, the Proforma builds on KGH Group consolidated statement and the actual outcome in KGH Customs is included in the Proforma adjustments.
When preparing

<<<

 the Proforma, the Company has used the following assumptions:
- The Proforma is based on financial reports for KGH Group according to unaudited management accounts,
- The Bonds issued on 22 May 2012 by KGH Customs are considered to have been

<<<

 issued on 1 January 2011 with unchanged conditions, except that the interest and borrowing costs charge the financial outcome for the period 1 January 2011 until 22 May 2015,
- The acquisition of KGH Group is considered to have been completed

<<<

 on 1 January 2011 with the same purchase sum as the acquisition on 24 May 2012. Allocation and amortisations of intangible assets charge the financial outcome from 1 January 2011.
- Proforma adjustments regarding differences in SGAAP and IFRS

<<<

 have been taken into consideration and no significant differences were identified.

21
- In connection with the issuance of the Bond on May 22 2012 all liabilities to external lenders and owners were repaid. The interest of the external loans

<<<

 has been reversed in the Proforma from January 1 2011.
- Adjustments connected to the PPA and conversion to IFRS and adjustments connected to the Bonds and their conditions have been considered to be permanent changes. All other adjustments

<<<

 have been considered temporary.
The sole purpose of the Proforma is to inform and to enlighten facts, and is, in its nature, intended to describe a hypothetical situation and thus it does not serve to describe the Company's actual or expected

<<<

 financial position or result as it would have been if the Acquisition and the adoption of IFRS would have occurred on the aforementioned dates.
KGH Customs' accounting principles are included in Appendix 1 to this Prospectus.

 goods with customs declarations from KGH Customs Services ApS. The Danish Customs Authority claimed that i) the customs value was DKK 3.7 million rather than the declared DKK 0.3 million, and that ii) it was not verified that the final destination

<<<

 was Poland as declared. This resulted in an increase in import duties of DKK 0.4 million and an increase in VAT charges of DKK 1.0 million, for KGH Customs Services ApS. KGH Customs Services ApS unsuccessfully appealed this decision. A new

<<<

 appeal has been submitted in which KGH Customs Services ApS claims for the VAT charges to be tax deductible. This appeal is currently pending and the final decision may be reached in 2013. The Company believes that the probability of a negative

<<<

 outcome of this litigation is high, which could result in a cash outflow of DKK 1.4 million. A provision of DKK 1.4 million for this contingency was made in the fiscal year of 2011.
During April and May 2009, KGH Belgium NV was instructed by

<<<

 the forwarder Flexitrans BV to make clearances on six shipments containing normal cargo. During an inspection, the customs found that two of the containers contained non-declared cigarettes. A full investigation regarding the cargo shipped

<<<

 via Flexitrans BV was then initiated by the customs, which found that the remaining four containers were removed from the storage under customs warehouse procedure4 without the knowledge of either the customs or KGH Belgium NV. An extended

<<<

 investigation was started by the customs covering all parties involved in the supply chain of these containers, including KGH Belgium NV, which had carried out the customs clearance. KGH Belgium NV was originally prosecuted together with its

<<<

 employee for possible involvement in the case, but after negotiations, the customs agreed to withdraw the prosecution towards KGH Belgium NV. One condition for the withdrawal was that KGH Belgium NV provided a EUR 500,000 guarantee to cover

<<<

 the environmental taxes and duties that were withheld in the declaration made by the employee on behalf of KGH Belgium NV. The EUR 500,000 has not had any effect on the income statement but on the cash flow statement of the Group. The guarantee

<<<

 is booked as a short term receivable and will be repaid to the Company in the case of a positive verdict for the employee of KGH Belgium NV. The first trial turned out with a negative verdict for the employee. However, the case is appealed

<<<

 and a new trial will probably take place in the first six months of 2013. The lawyers of KGH Belgium NV estimate that there is a good chance that the final verdict will be in favour of the employee of KGH Belgium NV, as they have identified

<<<

 weaknesses in the first verdict.
Except for the above mentioned litigations, the Company is not currently, and has not within the last twelve months been, subject to any material court or administrative proceedings which could have a significant

<<<

 effect on the Company's or the Group's financial position or profitability. Further, the Company is not aware of any legal proceedings or arbitration proceedings that could arise and which could have a significant effect on the Company's or

<<<

 the Group's financial position or profitability.
Credit rating Neither the Company nor the Bonds have a credit rating from an international credit rating institute.
4 Customs warehouse means that goods is not cleared when it crosses the border

<<<

 but instead is transported into the country to a
warehouse which is verified and is cleared when it is transported from the warehouse.

Appendix 1 - Summary of IFRS accounting principles

<<<


Overall considerations The significant accounting policies that have been used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are summarised below.
Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements consolidate those of the

<<<

 parent company and all of its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to December 31 2012. Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to control the financial and operating policies. The Group obtains and exercises control through

<<<

 more than half of the voting rights. All subsidiaries have a reporting date of 31 December.
All transactions and balances between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation, including unrealised gains and losses on transactions between

<<<

 Group companies. Where unrealised losses on intra group asset sales are reversed on consolidation, the underlying asset is also tested for impairment from a group perspective. Amounts reported in the financial statements of subsidiaries have

<<<

 been adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with the accounting policies adopted by the Group.
Profit or loss and other comprehensive income of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are recognised from the effective date

<<<

 of acquisition, or up to the effective date of disposal, as applicable.
Non-controlling interests, presented as part of equity, represent the portion of a subsidiary's profit or loss and net assets that is not held by the Group. The Group attributes

<<<

 total comprehensive income or loss of subsidiaries between the owners of the parent and the non-controlling interests based on their respective ownership interests.
Business combinations The Group applies the acquisition method for business

<<<

 combinations. The consideration transferred by the Group to obtain control of a subsidiary is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of assets transferred, liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group

<<<

, which includes the fair value of any asset or liability arising from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred. The Group recognises identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business

<<<

 combination regardless of whether they have been previously recognised in the acquirer's financial statements prior to the acquisition. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are generally measured at their acquisitiondate fair values.
Goodwill

<<<

 is stated after separate recognition of identifiable intangible assets. It is calculated as the excess of the sum of a) fair value of consideration transferred, b) the recognised amount of any non controlling interest in the acquiree and c

<<<

) acquisition-date fair value of any existing equity interest in the acquiree, over the acquisition-date fair values of identifiable net assets. If the fair values of identifiable net assets exceed the sum calculated above, the excess amount

<<<

 (i.e. gain on a bargain purchase) is recognised in profit or loss immediately.

66
Functional and presentation currency The consolidated financial statements are presented in currency SEK, which is also the functional currency of the parent

<<<

 company.
Foreign currency transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency of the respective Group entity, using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions (spot exchange

<<<

 rate). Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the re measurement of monetary items at year-end exchange rates are recognised in profit or loss.
Non-monetary items measured at historical

<<<

 cost are translated using the exchange rates at the date of the transaction (not retranslated). Non-monetary items measured at fair value are translated using the exchange rates at the date when fair value was determined.
Foreign operations

<<<

 In the Group's financial statements, all assets, liabilities and transactions of Group entities with a functional currency other than the SEK (the Group's presentation currency) are translated into SEK upon consolidation. The functional currency

<<<

 of the entities in the Group has remained unchanged during the reporting period.
On consolidation, assets and liabilities have been translated into SEK at the closing rate at the reporting date. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on

<<<

 the acquisition of a foreign entity and translated to SEK at the closing rate. Income and expenses have been translated into the Group's presentation currency at the average rate over the reporting period5. Exchange differences are charged

<<<

/credited to other comprehensive income and recognised in the currency translation reserve in equity. On disposal of a foreign operation the cumulative translation differences recognised in equity are reclassified to profit or loss and recognised

<<<

 as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
Segment reporting The Group has following operation segments: Sweden, Norway, Belgium and other. In identifying its operating segments, management generally follows the Group's service lines, which represent

<<<

 the main geographic areas the Group is operating within.
Each of these operating segments is managed separately as each of these service lines requires different technologies and other resources as well as marketing approaches. All inter-segment

<<<

 transfers are carried out at arm's length prices.
For management purposes, the Group uses the same measurement policies as those used in its financial statements. However Group-wide assets which are not directly attributable to the business

<<<

 activities of any operating segment such as, trademark, customer relations and goodwill are not allocated to a segment.
Revenue Revenue comprises revenue from the sale of custom clearance services and, in not materially extent, accountancy

<<<

 services, consulting services and software licenses. The Group recognizes revenues from completed service assignments on an on-going basis as the work is performed. On-going, not invoiced service assignments, is booked with the estimated sale

<<<

 value of the performed work in the balance sheet and is recognized in "other receivables
Interest and dividend income
Note that the use of average rates is appropriate only if rates do not fluctuate significantly (IAS 21.40).

67
Interest

<<<

 income and expenses are reported on an accrual basis using the effective interest method. Dividend income, is recognised at the time the right to receive payment is established.
Operating expenses Operating expenses are recognised in profit

<<<

 or loss upon utilisation of the service or at the date of their origin.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset, mostly activated cost for development of software

<<<

, asset are capitalised during the period of time that is necessary to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use or sale. Other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred and reported in 'finance costs' 

<<<

.
Borrowing costs includes interest expenses calculated by using the effective interest method. Interest expenses includes deferred amount of issue expenses and similar direct transaction costs to raise loans.
Brand and goodwill Brand, acquired

<<<

 in conjunction with business combination, is valued at fair value and is recognized separately.
Goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from a business combination that are note individually identified and separately recognized

<<<

.. Brand and goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses..
Other intangible assets Recognition o f other intangible assets Brand names and customer lists acquired in a business combination that qualify for separate recognition

<<<

 are recognised as intangible assets as their fair values.
Internally developed software Expenditures on the research phase of an internal project to develop customized software for IT and telecommunication systems are recognised as expenses

<<<

 in the period in which they are incurred.
Costs that are directly attributable to a projects development phase are recognised as intangible assets provided they meet the following recognition requirements: · the development costs can be measured

<<<

 reliably · the project is technically and commercial feasible · the Group intends to and has sufficient recourses to complete project · the Group has the ability to use or sell the software · the software will generate probable future economic

<<<

 benefits.
Development costs not meeting these criteria for capitalization are expensed as incurred.
Directly attributable costs include employee (other than directors) costs incurred on software development along with an appropriate portion

<<<

 of relevant overheads and borrowing costs.
Subsequent measurement ( The intangible assets mention below, including internally developed software, are considered finite. They are accounted for using the cost model whereby capitalised costs are

<<<

 amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Residual values and useful lives are reviewed at each reporting date. In addition, they are subject to impairment testing. The following useful are lives are applied: · Software

<<<

: 5-8 years

68
· Technology 15 years · Customer lists: 10 years
Activated internally generated software, that is not yet completed, are not depreciated but tested for impairment. Amortisation has been included within 'depreciation, amortisation

<<<

 and impairment of non-financial assets'. Costs associated with maintaining computer software, i.e expenditure relating to patches and other minor updates as well as their installation, is expensed as incurred.
The gain or loss arising on the

<<<

 disposal of an intangible asset is determined as the difference between the proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, and is recognised in profit or loss within 'other income' or 'other expenses'.
Tangible assets
Buildings IT-equipment

<<<

 and other equipment Buildings, IT equipment and other equipment (comprising fittings and furniture) are carried at acquisition cost or manufacturing cost less subsequent depreciation and impairment losses, including any costs directly attributed

<<<

 to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by the Group's management. Buildings an IT-equipment includes also buildings if they are held under a finance lease. Buildings

<<<

, IT-equipment and other equipment are then valued as acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Depreciation is recognised on a straight-line basis to write down the cost or valuation less estimated residual value

<<<

 of property, plant and equipment other than freehold land. The following useful lives are applied: · Buildings: 25-50 years · Other equipment: 3-5 years
In the case of leasehold property, expected useful lives are determined by reference to

<<<

 comparable owned assets or over the term of the lease, if shorter. Material residual value estimates and estimates of useful life are updated as required, but at least annually, whether or not the asset is re-valued.
Gains or losses arising

<<<

 on the disposal of property, plant and equipment are determined as the difference between the disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the assets and are recognised in profit or loss within 'other income' or 'other expenses'.

69
Leased

<<<

 assets
Operating leasing All other leases are treated as operating leases. Payments on operating lease agreements are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Associated costs, such as maintenance and insurance

<<<

, are expensed as incurred.
Impairment testing ofgoodwill, other intangible assets and tangible assets For impairment assessment purposes, assets are grouped at the lowest cash-generating units. A cash generating unit is an asset group with

<<<

 essentially independent cash inflows. As a result, some assets are tested individually for impairment and some are tested at cash-generating unit level. Goodwill, technology, customer lists and brand are tested at Group-level
Cash-generating

<<<

 units to which goodwill has been allocated (determined by the Group's management as equivalent to its operating segments) are tested for impairment at least annually. All other individual assets or cash-generating units are tested for impairment

<<<

 whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the asset's or cash-generating unit's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount

<<<

, which is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value-in-use. To determine the value-in-use, management estimates expected future cash flows from each cash-generating unit and determines a suitable interest rate in order to calculate

<<<

 the present value of those cash flows. The data used for impairment testing procedures are directly linked to the Group's latest approved budget, adjusted as necessary to exclude the effects of future reorganizations and asset enhancements

<<<

. Discount factors are determined individually for each cash-generating unit and reflect management's assessment of respective risk profiles, such as market an asset-specific risks factors. Impairment losses for cash-generating units reduce

<<<

 first the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to that cash-generating unit. Any remaining impairment loss is charged pro rata to the other assets in the cash-generating unit. With the exception of goodwill, all assets are subsequently

<<<

 reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously recognized may no longer exist. An impairment loss is reversed if the asset's or cash-generating unit's recoverable amount exceeds its carrying amount.
Financial instruments Recognition

<<<

, initial measurement and de-recognition Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument and are measured initially at fair value adjusted by

<<<

 transactions costs, except for those carried at fair value through profit or loss which are measured initially at fair value. Subsequent measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities are described below. Financial assets are derecognized

<<<

 when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or when the financial asset and all substantial risks and rewards are transferred. A financial liability is derecognized when it is extinguished, discharged, cancelled

<<<

 or expires.
Loans and receivables Loans and account receivables, which are in all material respect, the Group's financial assets are financial assets that are not derivatives, with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active

<<<

 marked. After initial recognition, these are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. Discounting is omitted where the effect of discounting is immaterial. The Group's cash equivalents,

<<<

 account receivables and most other receivables fall into this category of financial instruments. Individually significant receivables are considered for impairment when they are past due or when other objective evidence is received that a specific

<<<

 counterparty will default. Receivables that are not considered to be individually impaired are reviewed for impairment in groups, which are determined by

70
reference to the industry and region of the counterparty and other shared credit

<<<

 risk characteristics. The impairment loss estimate is then based on recent historical counterparty default rates for each identified group.
Classification and subsequent measurement offinancial liabilities The Group's financial liabilities

<<<

 include mainly bonds, customs debs, accounts payable and other payables.
Financial liabilities are measured subsequently at amortized cost using the effective interest method.
Income taxes Tax expense recognized in profit or loss comprises

<<<

 the sum of deferred tax and current tax not recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Current income tax assets and/or liabilities comprise those obligations to, or claims from, fiscal authorities relating to the current

<<<

 or prior reporting periods, that are unpaid at the reporting date. Current tax is payable on taxable profit, which differs from profit or loss in the financial statements. Calculation of current tax is based on tax rates and tax laws that have

<<<

 been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability method on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. However

<<<

, deferred tax is not provided on the initial recognition of goodwill, or on the initial recognition of an asset or liability unless the related transaction is a business combination or affects tax or accounting profit. Deferred tax on temporary

<<<

 differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures is not provided if reversal of these temporary differences can be controlled by the Group and it is probable that reversal will not occur in the foreseeable future.

<<<


Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated, without discounting, at tax rates that are expected to apply to their respective period of realization, provided those rates are enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting

<<<

 period.
Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that the underlying tax loss or deductible temporary difference will be able to be utilized against future taxable income. This is assessed based on the Group's forecast

<<<

 of future operation results, adjusted for significant non-taxable income and expenses and specific limits on the use of any unused tax loss or credit. Deferred tax liabilities are always provided for in full.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities

<<<

 are offset only when the Group has a right and intention to set off current tax assets and liabilities from the same taxation authority.
Changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognized as a component of tax income or expense in

<<<

 profit or loss, except where they relate to items that are recognized in other comprehensive income (such as the revaluation of land) or directly in equity, in which case the related deferred tax in also recognized in other comprehensive income

<<<

 or equity, respectively.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and available balances with banks and similar institutions, together with other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to

<<<

 known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value
Equity, reserves and dividend payments Share capital represents the nominal value of shares that have been issued.

71
Share premium includes any premiums

<<<

 received on issue of share capital. Any transaction costs associated with the issuing of shares are deducted from share premium, net of any related income tax benefits.
Other components of equity include the following: · Translation reserve

<<<

; include translation differences arising from the translation of financial
statements of the Group's foreign operations to the SEK
Retained earnings include all current and prior period retained profits and share-based employee remuneration

<<<

.
All transactions with owners of the parent are recorded separately within equity
Post-employment benefits and short-term employee benefits
Post-employment benefit plans The Group provides post-employment benefits through various defined contribution

<<<

 and defined benefit plans.
Defined contribution plans The Group has essentially defined benefit pension schemes. The group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay contributions in addition to its fixed contributions, which are recognized

<<<

 as an expense in the period that relevant employee services are received.
Short-term employee benefits Short-term employee benefits, including holiday entitlement, are current liabilities included in "pension and other employee obligations

<<<

", measured at the undiscounted amount that the Group expects to pay as a result of the unused entitlement.
Provisions, contingent assets and contingent liabilities Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present legal or constructive

<<<

 obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of economic resources will be required from the Group and amounts can be estimated reliable. Timing or amount of the outflow may still be uncertain.
Provisions are measured

<<<

 at the estimated expenditure required to settle the present obligation, based on the most reliable evidence available at the reporting date, including the risks and uncertainties associated with the present obligation. Where there are a number

<<<

 of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. Provisions are discounted to their present values, where the time value of money is material

<<<

.
In those cases where the possible outflow of economic resources as a result of present obligations is considered improbable or remote, no liability is recognized.
Significant management judgement in applying accounting policies and estimation

<<<

 uncertainty When preparing the financial statements, management undertakes a number of judgements, estimates and assumptions about the recognition and measurement of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Significant managementjudgement

<<<

 The following are significant management judgements in applying the accounting policies of the Group that have the most significant effect on the financial statements.

72
Capitalization of internally developed software The division between

<<<

 the research and development phases of new development of software and determining whether the requirements for capitalization of development expenses are met requires assessments. After activation the Group management controls whether the

<<<

 accounting requirements for development costs continue to be fulfilled and if there are indications that the capitalized expenditure may be vulnerable to a decline in value ( Estimation uncertainty Information about estimates and assumptions

<<<

 that have the most significant effect on recognition and measurement of assets, liabilities, income and expenses is provided below. Actual results may be substantially different.
Impairment In assessing impairment, management estimates the

<<<

 recoverable amount of each asset or cash-generating units based on expected future cash flows and use an interest rate to discount them. Estimation uncertainty relates to assumptions about future operating results and the determination of a

<<<

 suitable discount rate.
Useful lives of depreciable assets Management reviews its estimate of the useful lives of depreciable assets at each reporting date, based on the expected utility of the assets. Uncertainties in these estimates relate

<<<

 to technical obsolescence that may change the utility of certain software and IT equipment.
