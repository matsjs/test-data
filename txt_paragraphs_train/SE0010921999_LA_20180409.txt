<<<

 Calculation Principles) is equal to or less than: (i) from and including the First Issue Date until the date falling eighteen (18) months thereafter, 4.50:1; and (ii) thereafter, 4.00:1; and (b) no Event of Default is continuing or would occur

13.4.2

Net Interest Bearing Debt shall be measured on the Testing Date so determined, calculated pro forma including the new Financial Indebtedness provided that

<<<

 such Financial Indebtedness is an interest bearing obligation (however, any cash balance resulting from the incurrence of such new Financial Indebtedness shall not reduce Net Interest Bearing Debt).

13.4.3

<<<

 Period ending on the last day of the period covered by the most recent Financial Report (including when necessary, financial statements published before the First Issue Date) shall be used for the Incurrence Test, but adjusted so that (without

 otherwise discharged as a result of or in connection with a disposal of an entity (to the extent such Net Interest Bearing Debt is included in the relevant financial statements), in each case to the extent such disposal is attributable to the

<<<

 Reference Period or the period from the end of the Reference to the relevant Testing Date;

(b) increased on a pro forma basis by an amount equal to the Net Interest Bearing Debt directly attributable to (i) any Financial Indebtedness owed

<<<

 by acquired entities, and (ii) any Financial Indebtedness incurred to finance the acquisition of entities, in each case to the extent attributable to the Reference Period or the period from the end of the Reference to the relevant Testing Date

<<<

; and

13.4.5 In respect of the Acquisition Incurrence Test only

<<<
