10.4

The holder of each Bond will have the right to require

<<<

 early redemption of its Bonds (put option) at 100% of their par value plus accrued interest on 27 October 2015 (the "Optional Put Date"). To exercise such option, a Bondholder must notify the Paying Agent (via such Bondholder's Account Manager

 (in the case of the Bondholders, in writing via the Securities Depository). The Share Settlement Option Notice shall be given not more than 60 nor less than 30 days prior to the Maturity Date, in the case of a redemption of Bonds pursuant to

<<<

 clause 10.1, or not less than 45 days prior to the Optional Put Date in the case of a redemption pursuant to clause 10.4.
Where the Borrower shall have exercised the Share Settlement Option in respect of a redemption of Bonds pursuant to clause

 the aggregate principal amount of such Bondholder's Bonds by the Conversion Price in effect on the Valuation Date;
(b) making payment to the relevant Bondholder of an amount (the "Cash Settlement Amount") equal to the amount (if any) by which

<<<

 the aggregate principal amount of such Bonds exceeds the product of the Current Value of a Share on the Valuation Date and the whole number of Shares deliverable to such Bondholder in accordance with (a) above in respect of such Bonds; and

<<<


(c) making or procuring payment to the relevant Bondholder in cash of any accrued and unpaid interest in respect of such Bonds up to the relevant redemption date.
"Valuation Date" means the date falling three Dealing Days prior to the due date

<<<

 for redemption of the relevant Bonds.
Fractions of Shares will not be issued or transferred or delivered pursuant to this clause 10.5 and no cash payment will be made in lieu thereof.
Shares to be delivered in the manner contemplated in this

<<<

 clause 10.5 (other than pursuant to paragraph (v) below) upon exercise of the Share Settlement Option are referred to as "Redemption Settlement Shares".
If the Borrower does not give a Share Settlement Option Notice in the manner and by the

<<<

 time set out in this clause 10.5, or if, having given a Share Settlement Option Notice, the Shares shall cease to be listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange or the London Stock Exchange or trading in the Shares on the Oslo Stock Exchange or the London

<<<

 Stock Exchange is suspended or an Event of Default or Potential Event of Default shall have occurred, the Bonds shall be redeemed for cash in accordance with the provisions of clause 10.1 or clause 10.4, as the case may be (and any Share Settlement

<<<

 Option Notice shall be annulled).
When used in this clause 10.5, the "Current Value" in respect of a Share on the Valuation Date shall mean 99% of the average of the Volume Weighted Average Price of the Shares for the fifteen consecutive Dealing

 Days (the "VWAP Period") immediately subsequent to the date the Borrower has notified the Paying Agent that it will exercise its Cash Settlement Option in respect of the relevant exercise of Conversion Right(s), provided that if any Dividend

<<<

 or other entitlement in respect of the Shares is announced on or prior to the relevant Conversion Date in circumstances where the record date or other due date for the establishment of entitlement in respect of such Dividend or other entitlement

<<<

 shall be on or after the relevant Conversion Date and on any Dealing Day in the VWAP Period the Volume Weighted Average Price is based on a price ex-Dividend or other entitlement, then the Volume Weighted Average Price for such Dealing Day

14 Adjustm ent of the Conversion Price
Upon the happening of any of the events described below, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted

<<<

 as follows:
14.1 If and whenever there shall be a consolidation or subdivision of the Shares, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Price in force immediately prior to such consolidation or subdivision by the

<<<

 following fraction:

B where:

A

is the aggregate number of Shares in issue immediately before such

consolidation or subdivision, as the case may be; and

B

is the aggregate number of Shares in issue immediately after, and as a result of

 as fully paid to the Shareholders by way of capitalisation of profits or reserves (including any share premium account or capital redemption reserve) other than (1) where any such Shares issued instead of the whole or part of a Dividend in

<<<

 cash which the Shareholders would or could otherwise have received or (2) where the Shareholders may elect to receive a Dividend in cash in lieu of such Shares, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Price in force

<<<

 immediately prior to such issue by the following fraction:

A B

where:

A

is the aggregate nominal amount of the Shares in issue immediately before such

issue; and

B

is the aggregate nominal amount of the Shares in issue immediately after

 Dividend on the Relevant Stock Exchange or, in the case of a purchase of Shares or any receipts or certificates representing Shares by or on behalf of the Borrower or any Subsidiary of the Borrower, on which such Shares are purchased or, in

<<<

 the case of a Spin-Off, is the mean of the Volume Weighted Average Prices of a Share for the five consecutive Dealing Days ending on the Dealing Day immediately preceding the first date on which the Shares are traded ex- the relevant Spin-Off

<<<

; and

B

is the portion of the Fair Market Value, with such portion being determined by

dividing the Fair Market Value of the aggregate Dividend by the number of

Shares entitled to receive the relevant Dividend (or, in the case of a purchase

<<<

 of

Shares or any receipts or certificates representing shares by or on behalf of the

Borrower or any Subsidiary of the Borrower, by the number of Shares in issue

immediately prior to such purchase), of the Dividend attributable to one Share

Such adjustment shall become effective on the first date on which the Shares are traded ex- the relevant Dividend on the Relevant Stock Exchange or, in the case of a purchase of Shares or any receipts or certificates representing Shares,

<<<

 on the date such purchase is made or, in the case of a Spin-Off, the first date on which the Shares are traded ex- the relevant Spin-Off.

For the purposes of the above, the Fair Market Value of a Cash Dividend shall (subject as provided in

<<<

 paragraph (a) of the definition of "Dividend" and in the definition of "Fair Market Value") be determined as at the first date on which the Shares are traded ex- the relevant Dividend on the Relevant Stock Exchange, and in the case of a Non

"Non-Cash Dividend" means any Dividend which is not a

<<<

 Cash Dividend, and shall include a Spin-Off.

"Cash Dividend" means (i) any Dividend which is to be paid or made in cash (in whatever currency), but other than falling within paragraph (b) of the definition of "Spin-Off' and (ii) any Dividend

15 Merger and de-merger

15.1 In the case of any consolidation, amalgamation or merger of the Borrower with any other corporation (other than a consolidation, amalgamation or merger in which the Borrower is the continuing corporation

<<<

, amalgamation, merger, sale or transfer by a holder of the number of Shares which would have become liable to be issued upon exercise of Conversion Rights immediately prior to such consolidation, amalgamation, merger, sale or transfer. Such

<<<

 event have equal rights as the Borrower has granted to the bondholders in the convertible loan with ISIN NO 001 0395981, if such loan facility is still in existence when the Borrower enters into any such consolidation, amalgamation or merger
