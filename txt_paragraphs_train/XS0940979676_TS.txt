 Secured Floating Rate Notes.
Overview
We are a leading provider of electrical, heating and plumbing, HVAC and other installation and services solutions in Scandinavia, in terms of revenues. We operate in the Scandinavian Building Services Market

<<<

, which has historically demonstrated stability and resilience, having grown at a rate of approximately 4.5% per annum on average between 2006 and 2011. In 2011, we were the leading provider of installation and services solutions in Sweden and

<<<

 number two and number three provider of such services in Norway and Denmark, respectively, in each case in terms of revenue. With over 200 branches across 150 locations, we are one of the few companies that provide installation and services

<<<

 solutions throughout Scandinavia. In the twelve months ended March 31, 2013 on a Recalculation Basis, we recorded total net sales of SEK11,213 million (1,301.0 million) and generated Adjusted EBITDA of SEK632 million (73.3 million).
We provide

<<<

 installation and services solutions for new construction as well as for renovation and maintenance projects. Our installation business and our services business accounted for 48% and 52%, respectively, of our total net sales on a Recalculation

<<<

 Basis for the twelve months ended March 31, 2013. Our strong presence in both the installation and services markets enables us to cross-sell our offering to our customers in each of these business areas. Our installation business consists of

<<<

 the new installation or the redevelopment of, and adaptations to, technical systems in buildings, plants and infrastructure. Our services business consists of the operation, maintenance, repair, replacement, reconfiguration and monitoring of

<<<

 installations in buildings, plants and infrastructure.
We operate our installation and services businesses in three principal fields of technology: electrical; heating and plumbing; and HVAC.
· Electrical. Our electrical installation and services

<<<

 solutions include integrated, energy-efficient solutions for the supply of lighting, heating and energy, including the installation and servicing of electrical infrastructure in buildings and industrial facilities. This field of technology

<<<

 accounted for 53% of our total net sales on a Recalculation Basis for the twelve months ended March 31, 2013.
· Heating and plumbing. Our heating and plumbing installation and services solutions include waterborne heating, cooling, sanitation

<<<

 and sprinkler systems. This field of technology accounted for 27% of our total net sales on a Recalculation Basis for the twelve months ended March 31, 2013.
· HVAC. Our HVAC installation and services solutions include ventilation systems for

<<<

 air handling, air conditioning and climate control. This field of technology accounted for 16% of our total net sales on a Recalculation Basis for the twelve months ended March 31, 2013.
We also operate our installation and services businesses

<<<

 in a number of specialist areas, such as fire and safety, technology consulting and technical services management. Our other specialty installation and service solutions accounted for 4% of our total net sales on a Recalculation Basis for the

<<<

 twelve months ended March 31, 2013.
Our broad range of installation and services solutions for electrical, heating and plumbing and HVAC enables us to execute projects for a variety of infrastructure and buildings, creating a "one-stop shop

<<<

" for our customers. Our ability to provide fully integrated, comprehensive installation and services solutions ensures that all elements of the solutions that we deliver to our customers work well together, and we are able to assume responsibility

<<<

 for all stages of our installation and services projects, from inception to completion. We are one of only a small number of service providers in the market able to compete effectively for both large, complex projects and smaller projects,

<<<

 owing to our range of expertise, ability to deliver comprehensive solutions and our long-standing local relationships.
We have built a strong and diversified customer base across Scandinavia of over 50,000 customers, ranging from small and

<<<

 medium-sized enterprises that generate annual revenues of 50 million or less, to large corporations and public entities that typically generate much higher revenues. We serve a wide range of end-markets across Scandinavia, including the construction

<<<

, real estate, industrial and the public sector end markets. With a workforce of 7,868 employees, consisting of over 6,000 installers spread across Scandinavia, we have the ability to carry out a variety of projects ranging from small-scale

<<<

, local projects to largescale, complex projects across multiple sites.
Our customers are located in five main geographic divisions: Stockholm; northern Sweden; southern Sweden; Norway; and Denmark. These regions also constitute our reporting

<<<

 segments, consisting of: (i) the Stockholm division; (ii) the Sweden­ North division; (iii) the Sweden­South division; (iv) the Norway division; and (v) the Denmark division.

Competitive Strengths
Leading Market Positions in the Scandinavian Market Benefiting from Our Large Scale
We are a leading provider of electrical, heating and plumbing, HVAC

<<<

 and other installation and service solutions in Scandinavia in terms of revenue. In 2011, we were the leading provider of installation and service solutions in Sweden and the number two and number three provider of such services in Norway and

<<<

 Denmark, respectively, in each case in terms of revenue. We believe that we have achieved our leading market positions primarily due to our size and scale, wide reach and presence at the local level, broad service offering, long-standing customer

<<<

 relationships, strong brand recognition and reputation for quality. Our leading market positions provide us with a number of significant competitive advantages including, among others, strong brand recognition in the markets in which we operate

<<<

 and the ability to attract and retain key personnel and customers.
In addition to our leading market positions, we believe that we also benefit from our size and scale. We are one of a small number of service providers in the Scandinavian Building

<<<

 Services Market that competes on large, complex projects while also competing effectively on smaller projects, which we attribute primarily to our deep local relationships. We have an extensive geographic presence in Scandinavia, with approximately

<<<

 200 branches in approximately 150 locations, which has helped us maintain and develop a strong customer base. With a workforce of 7,868 employees, we have the ability to carry out a variety of projects ranging from small-scale, local projects

<<<

 to large-scale, complex projects. Due to our size and scale, we have been able to develop a broad offering of installation and services solutions. This has enabled us to execute projects for many different types of infrastructure and buildings

<<<

, including hospitals, shopping centers, schools, residential buildings and industrial buildings, making us a "one-stop shop" for our customers. We believe our size and scale also allow us to command favorable pricing and rebate terms from our

<<<

 suppliers compared to our smaller competitors, enabling us to consistently achieve higher margins and offer more attractive pricing terms to our customers.
As a result of our market leading positions, broad service offering, reputation for

<<<

 quality and one-stop shop capabilities, we believe we have become the supplier of choice to many of our large customers who have large-scale, multi-site, complex projects. We believe we are attractive to these customers because we are able

<<<

 to assume responsibility for all stages of their
5

installation and service projects. Our broad offering also gives us the opportunity to cross-sell our installation and services businesses and our different fields of technology to our customers

<<<

.
Favorable Macroeconomic Environment in Scandinavia and Attractive Industry Characteristics
We operate in Sweden, Norway and Denmark, which have historically exhibited greater stability and resilience compared to other European nations. Between

<<<

 2010 and 2012, for example, these countries experienced a real average GDP growth rate exceeding 2.0% per year, compared with the European Union which experienced a real average GDP growth rate of 1.1% per year. Scandinavian economies also

<<<

 benefit from relatively robust public finances and lower levels of sovereign indebtedness than most developed countries. In 2011, Sweden, Norway and Denmark had an average sovereign debt to GDP ratio of 4.0% (surplus) to 4.4% (deficit) across

<<<

 the European Union. We have historically generated significant net sales from public sector projects (22% of our total net sales for the year ended December 31, 2012 were attributable to public sector projects), and have benefitted from the

<<<

 strong and resilient economic performance of the Scandinavian countries.
In addition to relatively stable macroeconomic conditions in Scandinavia compared to other European nations, we have also benefitted from certain growth drivers in the

<<<

 construction market. Installation costs as a percentage of total construction costs have increased in Scandinavia. We believe this is the result of increasingly stringent energy efficiency regulations in Scandinavia and a growing demand for

<<<

 technically sound and sophisticated building services providers who are able to deliver complex installation solutions to customers. This increased complexity of installation projects has led to a growing need for service providers who are

<<<

 able to provide comprehensive installation solutions that can be adapted to the particular needs of the customer. We also have a distinct advantage in being able to partner with major construction companies in our markets to tender jointly

<<<

, often on a cost-plus basis, for larger projects. We believe that our strong historical relationships with key construction companies in Scandinavia, such as NCC, Skanska and PEAB, have positioned us well to capitalize on this advantage in

<<<

 the future. Various market segments within the broader construction market in Scandinavia have also demonstrated resilience during the recent periods of economic uncertainty. For example, the Scandinavian Building Services Market in which we

<<<

 operate grew at a rate of 4.5% per annum on average between 2006 and 2011. We benefit from a strong presence in the renovation and maintenance market in Scandinavia, which represents approximately 59% of the Scandinavian Construction Market

<<<

 and has remained resilient through the recent economic downturns and the decline in demand in Scandinavia's new construction market of approximately 22% between 2008 and 2012.
Diversified Operations with a Large Share of Recurring Revenues

<<<


We believe that our diversified operations, including our broad customer base, various end-markets, wide-ranging service offering, extensive local networks, focus on maintenance services and small average order sizes, provide us with recurring

<<<

 and relatively predictable revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2012, our top ten customers represented 20% of our total net sales, and our largest customer represented 6% of our total net sales. Our customers' businesses range from construction

<<<

, the public sectors and industrial sectors to private real estate, which has helped us to withstand adverse conditions in any single customer industry. Our customer base spans Sweden, Norway and Denmark and, as a result, our exposure to the

<<<

 effects of macroeconomic volatility experienced in any single country is reduced. Our broad range of installation and service solutions in the electrical, heating and plumbing and HVAC fields also protects us against a decline in demand in

<<<

 any one of these fields. We believe that such diversification reduces volatility in our results, limits our exposure to any single industry, country or field, and provides us with the flexibility to respond promptly to changing trends and customer

<<<

 requirements.
We also benefit from a portfolio made up of a large number of small contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2012, for example, 75% of our projects individually generated less than SEK10 million in revenues and 44% of our projects

<<<

 generated less than SEK1 million in revenues. A significant portion of our revenues are attributable to renovation and maintenance projects, which have historically exhibited resilient and stable growth, and consequently more-predictable revenues

<<<

 compared to our revenues from new construction. For the year ended December 31, 2012, 45% of our total net sales from our installation business was generated from renovation and maintenance projects with the remaining 55% generated by new construction

<<<

. With a strong presence in both the installation and services markets, we are able to cross-sell our offering in each of these business areas to customers. Moreover, our expertise in the electrical, heating and plumbing, and HVAC fields has

<<<

 enabled us to sell multiple addon services to customers who initially approached us for our services in only one field. We prioritize maintenance services contracts with our customers, the demand for which we have found to be relatively inelastic

<<<

.
Proven Ability to Sustain Profitable Operations Owing to High Revenue Visibility, a Variable Cost Structure and Effective Operational Structure
We have historically demonstrated our ability to maintain stability in our EBITDA performance and

<<<

 EBITDA margins, including during times of macroeconomic volatility. Our ability to sustain profitable operations is underpinned in large part by our strong order book and high incidence of repeat business, which together provide high revenue

<<<

 visibility. As of December 31, 2012, our order backlog was SEK4,809 million, which represented 82% of our installation net sales for the year ended December 31, 2012, and as of March 31, 2013, our order backlog was SEK4,914 million, which included

<<<

 net sales likely to occur beyond 2013 and represented 85% of our installation net sales for the twelve months ended March 31, 2013. We also benefit from a high rate of repeat business. For example, customers who did business with us in 201

<<<

1 represented over 90% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2012. In addition, the majority of our net sales from our services business is attributable to recurring service agreements which typically have terms of between one and

<<<

 three years, offering consistent and predictable revenue
6

generation. We also have the ability to systematically pass through raw material price increases, such as price increases in petroleum, copper, steel and aluminum, to our customers

<<<

, consequently limiting the impact of raw material price volatility on our revenue flow.
We usually experience the impact of adverse economic conditions late in the macroeconomic cycle, which allows for timely adjustments to our cost structure

<<<

. For example, in 2009, during the most recent economic downturn in Sweden, we successfully initiated cost rationalization programs early in the cycle with the aim of reducing our administrative expenses in anticipation of lower levels of business

<<<

 activity. Additionally, we have in the past been able to relocate our personnel from regions experiencing lower demand for our services to regions experiencing higher demand, which gave us the flexibility to reallocate our resources based on

<<<

 market conditions and customer requirements. For example, in March 2013, we relocated a team of installers from our Sweden­South division to Norway, where we were experiencing higher demand for our services but had limited numbers of skilled

<<<

 personnel available. At the same time, we made a concerted effort to grow our more stable services business, signing agreements for a number of major service projects while market prices were still relatively favorable and performing those

<<<

 contracts later in the cycle. We also benefit from low fixed costs, because most of our costs are highly variable.
We believe that our management structure also contributes to the profitability of our operations. Our decentralized management

<<<

 model promotes enterprise and accountability at all levels of our structure and encourages local branches to operate as individual profit centers. We believe that the autonomy that we offer our branch managers incentivizes them to capitalize

<<<

 on their local market knowledge and to deliver strong results. We encourage our local offices to grow sales by collaborating with offices located nearby to increase the share of projects covering more than one field of technology. In a market

<<<

 that is predominantly customer-facing, the quality of our branch managers is fundamental to building and maintaining strong and lasting customer relationships. We believe that, due to our leadership position, brand visibility, national and

<<<

 local reputation and involvement in industry-leading projects, we have been able to attract and retain some of the leading talent in the industry. We closely monitor branch performance to identify under-performing branches, enabling us to quickly

<<<

 determine whether to restructure under-performing branches or to close them.
Strong Track Record of High Cash Flow Generation
We have historically demonstrated consistently strong cash flow generation, which we believe has been driven primarily

<<<

 by our negative working capital requirements due to required customer prepayments for installation projects and our historically low capital expenditure requirements. As a services company, our business is characterized by low capital expenditures

<<<

, representing less than 0.1% of our total net sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012. Our strong cash flow generation has allowed us to pursue our external growth strategy, and we have made more than 28 acquisitions

<<<

 since 2007. Our cash conversion ratio was 67.5%, 97.7% and 80.6% for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively.
Acquisitions in a Consolidating Market Supplement Organic Growth
We have a strong track record of organic growth

<<<

, which is complemented by growth through acquisitions. We believe that our leading market positions give us an advantage in pursuing attractive acquisition opportunities, because providers of building services who may be contemplating selling

<<<

 their businesses are more likely to contact us rather than, or prior to, our smaller or lesser-known competitors. The Scandinavian Building Services Market is a highly fragmented market with more than 33,000 operators. We have market share

<<<

 of approximately 6% in Sweden, 3% in Norway and 3% in Denmark. The Scandinavian Building Services Market is composed of a large number of small companies, although approximately 89% of operators in the market had fewer than ten full-time employees

<<<

 on their payroll in 2010, which we believe presents attractive consolidation opportunities to complement our current offering. We believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this increasing consolidation in a fragmented market to grow

<<<

 our market share and presence. We have a strong track record of growth through acquisitions, having completed and integrated more than 28 acquisitions since 2007. We operate an organizational structure that encourages regional and local managers

<<<

 to identify and pursue accretive bolt-on acquisitions that lead to operational synergies, while maintaining group-level oversight over larger acquisitions. We follow a disciplined acquisition strategy focused on the retention of key personnel

<<<

 and the expansion of our geographic footprint and our technical capabilities, with a focus on attractively priced businesses that offer significant opportunities for margin improvements. We work to systematically improve our target companies

<<<

' performance by aligning their operations with our business model, minimizing non-core activities, increasing shares of recurring business, expanding customer bases and rationalizing low-profit, high-risk projects. We have also sought to improve

<<<

 the profitability and cash flow of the companies we acquire by realizing synergies, particularly in purchasing and rationalizing their cost structure and support functions such as human resources, procurement and administration, as well as

<<<

 improving their working capital management.
Experienced Management Team, Incentivized Employees and Shareholder Support
Our senior management team is led by our chief executive officer Staffan Påhlsson, who has extensive experience in managing

<<<

 installation and services businesses, integrating acquired companies and rationalizing operational costs. Mr. Påhlsson has been with us for more than 30 years in various capacities, having begun as an electrical installer in our organization

<<<

. Our senior management also includes a strong team of executive officers, including heads of our geographic divisions, who on average have over 20 years of industry experience. We believe that the incentives of our management are aligned with

<<<

 our long-term
7

goals, with over 125 key employees holding an equity stake in our group. We also benefit from the extensive market expertise, business relationships and ongoing strong support of our shareholder, Bain Capital.
Our Strategy

<<<


Continue to Grow Our Leading Market Positions by Focusing on Our Local Operations and Investing in Our Employees
We aim to be the largest or second-largest operator in at least one of our fields of technology in each of the localities in which

<<<

 we do business. We believe that we are well positioned to grow our leading market positions throughout Scandinavia and strong local market positions by continuing to provide high-quality services and support to our customers and employees,

<<<

 and by focusing on our local operations. We intend to continue to operate a large, decentralized organization, with local branch units operating as individual profit centers. Maintaining a well-established, local presence throughout Scandinavia

<<<

 also provides our customers with a large number of local access points. We intend to continue to leverage our strong customer relationships and local market knowledge to meet our customers' needs promptly and efficiently, in order to establish

<<<

 ourselves as the provider of choice in the markets in which we operate.
Our employees are key to maintaining and growing our leading-market positions. We also intend to utilize our reputation, brand awareness and scale to continue to recruit

<<<

 and retain the best talent in the industry and to position us as the employer of choice. We intend to improve the performance of our managers and technicians by continuing to develop professional and technical training programs and by assigning

<<<

 our engineers and technicians to a wide range of fields. We also intend to continue to incentivize our managers and technicians by maintaining a performance-based compensation structure.
Continue to Improve Profitability Through Operational

<<<

 Excellence and Economies of Scale
While we differentiate our offering by providing consistent, high-quality installation and technical services and offering a wide range of services to our customers, we believe we also are able to drive cost

<<<

 savings by standardizing, simplifying and sharing systems and best practices across our group. In order to continue to improve our margins and cash flow, we intend to pursue the following initiatives:
· Sales initiatives. We intend to focus

<<<

 our sales initiatives on cross-selling opportunities across the electrical, heating and plumbing, and HVAC fields and on increasing the total number of customers that utilize our installation and technical services offering.
· Cost-saving initiatives

<<<

. Our competitiveness and long-term profitability depend, to a significant degree, on our ability to control costs and maintain efficient operations. We believe that we are well positioned to leverage our scale to optimize our cost structure

<<<

. In particular, we intend to continue to reduce our costs by using our scale to negotiate volume discounts in supply chain sourcing and procurement, to focus on the disciplined management of our administrative costs and improve the efficiency

<<<

 of our workforce.
· Operational initiatives. We intend to focus our operational initiatives on developing local logistical capabilities in order to reduce onsite downtime, on effectively monitoring project costs and working capital requirements

<<<

 and on streamlining our operations across our network of branch offices. We recently completed an extensive diagnostic review of our operations and have identified several opportunities to improve operational excellence in these areas. We also

<<<

 plan to continue our strategy of rationalizing our operations that were loss-making.
Continue to Leverage Our Comprehensive, Integrated Offering
Many of our large customers are increasingly seeking providers who are able to operate in electrical

<<<

, heating and plumbing, and HVAC, due to the technical complexity of the systems and cost pressures. Many customers are also making their purchasing decisions at the group level rather than on a facility-by-facility basis. This has resulted

<<<

 in a growing number of multisite contracts that require experience with different fields of technology, as well as the scale to enable the efficient management of complex logistics that are a part of large, multi-site projects. Our multiple

<<<

 locations and broad local network allow us to remain responsive to customers' needs, and to optimize our response to demand for increasingly complex installations. We believe that we are well positioned to benefit from these market trends and

<<<

 that our wide range of expertise across various fields of technology, our technical and logistical expertise and our dense local network will continue to provide a "one-stop" installation and service offering.
Continue to Focus on Recurring

<<<

 Revenues
We believe that the diversity of our customers and our contract portfolio across our operating segments result in strong, recurring revenues, which help us withstand negative business cycles in any single aspect of our business. Under

<<<

 our business model, we avoid riskier, large one-off contracts, which we view as riskier than relatively small contracts for recurring services. We intend to increase our share of recurring projects with all of our customers by continuing to

<<<

 focus on small installation projects and maintenance service contracts. We intend to extend this strategy to the companies we acquire. We also plan to maintain a balance between our installation and services businesses and to continue to capitalize

<<<

 on our ability to provide add-on maintenance services following the completion of our installation projects.
8

Continue to Leverage "Green Economy" Initiatives
As energy prices rise and concerns over climate change increase, local, national

<<<

 and regional authorities, corporate customers and the public are increasingly demanding socially responsible energy consumption. We believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of growth in the "green economy." The energy consumption

<<<

 of a building is significantly influenced by the design of its electrical, heating and plumbing, and HVAC systems. As a leading Scandinavian installer and servicer of these systems, we are able to support customers seeking to optimize energy

<<<

 utilization in both new and existing buildings. We also offer energy efficiency solutions for several different types of power generation. We aim to increase our revenues attributable to the "green economy" by further developing innovative

Continue to Grow Our Market Presence Through Bolt-on Acquisitions and Continued Participation in Industry Consolidation The installation and technical services industry remains

<<<

 highly fragmented, presenting us with attractive acquisition
opportunities. We continually evaluate opportunities to acquire and integrate other installation and technical services providers in Scandinavia in order to strengthen our competitive

<<<

 position, broaden the range of our offering and increase our presence in our existing markets. We make acquisition decisions at the branch level or centrally, depending on the size of the target and pursue acquisition opportunities that meet

<<<

 our strategic goals on terms acceptable to us. We believe we have significant experience in identifying, executing and integrating acquisitions while remaining focused on our financial policies. We intend to continue to grow through strategic

<<<

 bolt-on acquisitions by pursuing a two-prong acquisition strategy. First, in our core geographic markets, we intend to continue to consolidate our leading position through bolt-on acquisitions. In these markets, we intend to focus on targets

<<<

 that provide access to technical capabilities or geographic coverage that complements our existing capabilities and address any gaps within our current offering, particularly in Sweden and Norway. We also plan to identify targets based on their

<<<

 potential to supplement our offering in our strategic geographic locations. Secondly, we intend to grow selectively within complementary geographic markets, where we believe we will be able to efficiently replicate our core business model.

<<<

 We aim to continue to realize the operational synergies offered by the companies we acquire and to improve their performance by aligning their operations with our business.

On the Issue Date, the Notes and the Note Guarantees, together with obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations, are secured by security interests granted

In addition, prior to June 15, 2015 the Issuer may redeem all or

<<<

 part of the SEK Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes by paying a "make-whole" premium described under "Description of the Senior Secured Notes-- Optional Redemption."
All payments in respect of the Notes or with respect to any Note Guarantee

<<<

 will be made without withholding or deduction for any taxes or other governmental charges, except to the extent required by law. If withholding or deduction is required by law, subject to certain exceptions, the Issuer, or the relevant Guarantor

<<<

, as applicable, will pay additional amounts so that the net amount you receive is no less than that which you would have received in the absence of such withholding or deduction. See "Description of the Senior Secured Notes-- Withholding Taxes

<<<

." The Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time, upon giving prior notice, if certain changes in tax law impose certain withholding taxes on amounts payable on the Notes and, as a result, the Issuer or a Guarantor is

<<<

 required to pay additional amounts with respect to such withholding taxes. If the Issuer decides to exercise such redemption right, it must pay you a price equal to the principal amount of the Notes plus interest and additional amounts, if

<<<

 any, to the date of redemption. See "Description of the Senior Secured Notes--Redemption for Taxation Reasons."
Upon certain events defined as constituting a change of control, the Issuer will be required to offer to repurchase the Notes at

<<<

 101% of their principal amount plus accrued interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of such repurchase. A change of control will not be deemed to have occurred if a specified consolidated leverage ratio is not exceeded immediately

<<<

 prior to and after giving pro forma effect to such event. See "Description of the Senior Secured Notes--Change of Control."
The Issuer has issued the Notes under the Indenture. The Indenture limits, among other things, the ability of the Issuer

<<<

 and its restricted subsidiaries to:
· incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock;
· pay dividends, redeem capital stock and make certain investments;
· make certain other restricted payments;
· create or permit

<<<

 to exist certain liens;

· enter into certain transactions

<<<

 with affiliates;
· merge or consolidate with other entities;

<<<

, which may include the financing of acquisitions from time to time. If we are unable to identify suitable acquisition opportunities, we may use all or part of the proceeds from the Issue retained as cash on balance sheet, together with other

<<<

 cash reserves, to fund distributions to our shareholders. See "Use of Proceeds."
The Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. The

<<<

 Notes are subject to restrictions on transfer and may only be offered or sold in transactions that are exempt from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act. See "Important information."
The Notes are new securities for which

SUMMARY CONSOLIDATED HISTORICAL AND RECALCULATED FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION
The following tables present certain summary consolidated historical and recalculated financial information and other financial

<<<

 information as of and for the dates indicated. The historical financial information of the Predecessor as of and for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012 presented below has been derived or extracted from the Predecessor's audited

<<<

 consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, which are incorporated through reference into this Prospectus.
The historical unaudited condensed consolidated financial information as of and

<<<

 for the three months ended March 31, 2012 has been derived or extracted from the Predecessor's unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2012, which are incorporated through

<<<

 reference into this Prospectus. The historical unaudited condensed consolidated financial information as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2013 has been derived or extracted from the Issuer's unaudited interim condensed consolidated

<<<

 financial statements as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2013, which are incorporated through reference into this Prospectus. Results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2013 are not necessarily indicative

<<<

 of results for a full fiscal year, or for any other periods.
We have also presented unaudited recalculated condensed consolidated financial information and other financial information for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and for the year

<<<

 ended December 31, 2012, which have been prepared on a Recalculation Basis. The unaudited recalculated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2012 give effect to the Acquisition Transactions as if they had occurred on January

<<<

 1, 2012.
The recalculation adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable. The summary unaudited recalculated consolidated financial and other data are for information purposes only and

<<<

 do not purport to represent what our results of operations or other financial information actually would have been if the Acquisition Transactions had occurred at any date, and such data do not purport to project the results of operations for

<<<

 any future period. In addition, due to the accounting impact of the Acquisition Transactions and the acquisition accounting-related adjustments that affect the results and other items of the Successor such as the increased interest expense

<<<

 resulting from the Acquisition Transactions, the recalculation results are not directly comparable to our Predecessor's results presented in this Prospectus.
We also present below as adjusted data which give effect to the issuance of the Notes

<<<

 and the application of the net proceeds therefrom, as set forth under the heading "Use of Proceeds." Such recalculated information as adjusted data has been provided for illustrative purposes only and do not purport to represent what our actual

<<<

 results would have been if the Issue had occurred on April 1, 2012, in the case of income statement data.
The unaudited recalculated financial information for the twelve months ended March 31, 2013 has been derived on a Recalculation Basis

<<<

 and by adding the unaudited financial information for three months ended March 31, 2013 to the unaudited recalculated financial information for the year ended December 31, 2012 and subtracting our unaudited recalculated financial information

<<<

 for the three months ended March 31, 2012. This information has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and is not prepared in the ordinary course of our financial reporting. Such compilation has not been audited or reviewed.
We also present

<<<

 certain key EBITDA Metrics and operating metrics, in addition to our IFRS measures, used by our management to evaluate, monitor and manage our business. None of these terms are measures of financial performance under IFRS, and so they should

<<<

 not be considered to be alternatives to our IFRS results. These terms may not be comparable to similar terms used by competitors or other companies. See "Presentation of Information--Non-IFRS Financial and Operating Information."
Prospective

<<<

 investors below should read the summary data presented below in conjunction with "Use of Proceeds," "Capitalization," "Unaudited Recalculated Condensed Consolidated Financial Information," "Selected Historical Consolidated Financial and Other

<<<

 Information," "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes which are incorporated through reference into this Prospectus.

RISK FACTORS
You should carefully consider the risks described below as well as the other information contained in this Prospectus before making an investment decision. Any of the following risks may have a material adverse effect on

<<<

 our business, financial condition or results of operations, and as a result you may lose all or part of your original investment. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known

<<<

 to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Risks Related to Our Business and Industry
Our business may be adversely affected by difficult

<<<

 economic conditions and other factors beyond our control.
Our results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the Scandinavian, European and global economies. The demand for our services tends to be cyclical and can be significantly

<<<

 lower in an economic environment characterized by lower household income and corporate earnings and lower levels of government and business spending. Demand for our services depends in particular on spending in residential and commercial construction

<<<

 in the Scandinavian region as well as renovation and maintenance in industrial and infrastructure markets in that region, and a prolonged period of slow growth or economic contraction may reduce demand for our services. The level of activity

<<<

 in these end-markets depends on a variety of factors that we cannot control, including:
· local, regional and general economic conditions, slowdowns and recessions;
· the policies of the countries in which we operate, including the policies

<<<

 of the central banks of Sweden, Norway and Denmark;
· the policies of transnational institutions, such as the European Central Bank and other institutions of the European Union, which influence the performance of national economies in countries

<<<

 in which we operate; and
· the level of demand in construction and in manufacturing and process industries, demographic trends, capital spending and consumer confidence.
Unfavorable developments with respect to any or all of these or other

<<<

 factors can have a significant impact on the demand for the services that we offer, both in terms of decreased volumes and price levels.
One of our main market drivers is activity in the new construction market, which is sensitive to general

<<<

 business and economic conditions both regionally and worldwide, including the availability of credit, interest rates, inflation, fluctuations in capital, the credit and mortgage markets, changes in tax laws affecting the real estate industry

<<<

, unemployment levels, and business and consumer confidence. The demand for some of our services is cyclical to the construction market.
We also provide our services to the renovation and maintenance and related services market, which has historically

<<<

 been more resilient to macroeconomic changes and tends to be countercyclical. However, high mortgage delinquency and foreclosure rates and limitations in the availability of home improvement financing may limit consumers' spending during economic

<<<

 downturns, particularly on discretionary items, and affect their confidence level, leading to continued reduced spending on home improvement projects. The impact of these economic factors specific to the renovation and maintenance market may

<<<

 be further exacerbated by unemployment levels.
There was a significant decline in global economic growth beginning in the second half of 2008 and continuing through 2009. In addition, volatility and disruption in the capital markets during

<<<

 that period reached unprecedented levels, with stock markets falling dramatically and credit becoming very expensive or unavailable to many companies. As a result of these developments, many lenders and institutional investors reduced, and

<<<

 in some cases ceased, to provide funding to borrowers. When the liquidity of our customers declines, their ability to purchase our services also declines.
Although industry conditions began to improve, with Sweden's GDP in particular growing

<<<

 to 6.6% in 2010 from a negative growth rate of 5.0% in 2009, weakening economic conditions in the Scandinavian countries beginning in the second half of 2012 had a negative impact on our revenues compared to the prior period. Adverse developments

<<<

 in global financial markets and general business and economic conditions, including economic recessions, downturns or negative developments or general weakness in the economies of the Scandinavian countries could have a material adverse effect

<<<

 on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
A key element of our growth strategy involves acquisitions, and we may experience difficulties identifying acquisition targets, integrating acquired businesses and

<<<

 achieving anticipated synergies.
Growth through acquisitions is one of our key growth strategies. We regularly identify and evaluate acquisition opportunities. Although we have not currently entered into binding agreements with respect to any

<<<

 potential acquisitions, we may in the future, including prior to the completion of the Offering, enter into binding agreements to acquire additional businesses that we expect to complement or augment our existing operations. There can be no

<<<

 assurance, however, that suitable acquisition targets will be identified in the future, or that we will be able to finance such acquisitions on favorable terms. Furthermore,
21

acquisitions we have already made or future acquisitions may

<<<

 not be integrated successfully into our operations and may not achieve desired financial objectives. Any acquisitions of businesses entail numerous operational and financial risks, including:
· higher than expected acquisition and integration

<<<

 costs;
· the possibility that we could pay more than the acquired company or its assets are worth;
· the possibility that we may not identify appropriate acquisition targets, complete future acquisitions on satisfactory terms or realize expected

<<<

 synergies or cost savings within expected timelines;
· unforeseen expenses, delays or conditions may be imposed upon the acquisition, including due to required regulatory approvals or consents;
· exposure to unknown liabilities;
· difficulty

<<<

 and cost in combining the operations and personnel of acquired businesses with our existing operations and personnel;
· diversion of management's attention from our day-to-day business;
· impairment of relationships with key suppliers or customers

<<<

 of acquired businesses due to changes in management and ownership and the restructuring of logistics and information technology systems;
· the inability to retain key employees of acquired businesses;
· difficulty avoiding labor disruptions

<<<

 in connection with any integration, particularly in connection with any headcount reduction; and
· the incurrence of substantial debt.
The occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial

<<<

 condition.
In addition, there can be no assurance that, following integration into our group, an acquired operation will be able to maintain its customer base consistent with expectations or generate the expected margins or cash flow. Although

<<<

 we analyze each acquisition target, our assessments are subject to a number of assumptions concerning profitability, growth, interest rates and company valuations. We may have difficulties in implementing our business model within an acquired

<<<

 company due to various factors, including conflicting corporate culture. There can be no assurance that our assessments of and assumptions regarding acquisition targets will prove to be correct and actual developments may differ significantly

<<<

 from our expectations.
In agreeing to acquire entities, we generally make certain assumptions and determinations on, among other things, future net sales and earnings, based on our investigation of the respective businesses and other information

<<<

 then available. We cannot assure you that our assumptions and determinations will prove to be correct or that liabilities, contingencies or other risks previously not known to us will not arise. In addition, we may be limited in our ability

<<<

 to acquire companies depending on the concentration of ownership in specific markets and our relative market position. Any such unanticipated risks, liabilities, contingencies, losses or issues, if realized, could have a material adverse effect

<<<

 on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Furthermore, acquisitions of companies expose us to the risk of unforeseen obligations with respect to employees, customers, suppliers and subcontractors of acquired businesses

<<<

, public authorities and other parties. We cannot ensure that there will not be unexpected risks or obligations. Such obligations, were they to materialize, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial

<<<

 condition.
We may not be able to successfully manage future growth.
Our ability to manage our growth and integrate operations, technologies, services and personnel depends on our administrative, financial and operational controls and our ability

<<<

 to create the infrastructure necessary to exploit market opportunities for our services, as well as our financial resources. In order to compete effectively and to grow our business profitably, we will need, on a timely basis, to maintain and

<<<

 improve our financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures, implement new systems as necessary, attract and retain adequate management personnel, and hire, retain and train a highly qualified workforce. Furthermore, we

<<<

 expect that as we continue to introduce new services and enter new markets, we will be required to manage an increasing number of relationships with various customers and other third parties. This would typically require us to attract, train

<<<

 and retain increasing numbers of highly skilled technical personnel and branch managers. The failure or delay of our management in responding to these challenges could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and

<<<

 result of operations.
22

We operate in highly competitive markets.
The market for installation and services is highly competitive. There are currently a large number of small, local companies and a smaller number of relatively large regional

<<<

, national and multinational companies operating in our markets. We also expect that new competitors may develop over time as smaller enterprises become more established and reliable and refine their service capabilities.
Competition varies

<<<

 depending on business area, customer classification and geographic area. The principal competitive factors in our business include the following:
· the availability and cost of materials and supplies;
· technical product knowledge and expertise

<<<

 as to application and usage;
· consulting and other service capabilities;
· the ability to build and maintain customer relationships;
· the effective use of technology to identify net sales and operational opportunities;
· same-day delivery

<<<

 capabilities for certain services; and
· the pricing of services and the provision of credit.
Some of our current or future competitors may have greater resources than we do, and may use this advantage to further increase their market share

<<<

. Competitors may also engage in aggressive pricing tactics, which may lead to us having to reduce our prices in order to compete with them. We may not be able to maintain our competitive position in the different markets in which we operate

<<<

. If we were to face such competition, our net sales, profitability and market shares may decline, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
In addition, the nature of the markets

<<<

 in which we compete may attract new entrants, particularly from countries with low-cost employment. Although we consider this risk to be relatively limited, competition with service providers that benefit from lower cost structures may challenge

<<<

 our competitive position. Furthermore, in recent years, new construction methods have led to the introduction of a range of new low-cost installation solutions. For example, as low-cost prefabricated housing construction becomes more common

<<<

, the demand for prefabricated building and housing components with pre-built low-cost installations may increase, which may have an adverse impact on the demand for our services. If we are unable to respond to these shifts in demand, our sales

<<<

 may decline, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
We also may expend significant time and resources in order to prepare a bid or participate in a bidding process, at the end of which we may

<<<

 not be retained. Even if we are awarded a contract, it may not yield the expected results. The timetable and/or cost structure of our projects can differ from bid estimates because both depend on a wide range of parameters, some of which are

<<<

 difficult to forecast at the beginning of a project, such as the accessibility of the work site, the availability of qualified personnel, adverse weather conditions and increases in the prices of petroleum or raw materials used in the materials

<<<

 we purchase for installation in our customers' sites (for example, copper with respect to cables) which we may not be able to pass on through re-invoicing to our customers. Our inability to accurately predict the actual cost of providing our

<<<

 services could result in a decrease in our margins, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
The Scandinavian Building Services Market has low barriers to entry at the local branch level and we may face a loss

<<<

 of market share or a decrease in margins from increased price competition in certain local markets.
The market for installation and services is highly fragmented, with low barriers to entry at the local level. Our local branches compete with

<<<

 a large number of relatively small local installers and service providers, some of whom benefit from operating efficiencies or lower overhead costs than us, which enables them to offer lower prices than we do. This has in the past and may continue

<<<

 to result in a high degree of competition at the local or regional level in the Scandinavian Building Services Market. Increased industry competition could result in increased price competition, lower profit margins, a decline in our market

<<<

 share and greater competition for qualified personnel. If we were to face such competition, our net sales, profitability and market shares may decline, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial

<<<

 condition.
Our competitors continue to consolidate, which could cause the markets in which we operate to become more competitive and could negatively impact our business.
There has been an increase in consolidation activity among our competitors

<<<

 in the markets in which we operate. This consolidation is being driven primarily by customer need and supplier capabilities, which could cause our markets to become more competitive as greater economies of scale are achieved by our competitors

<<<

. Customers are increasingly aware of the total costs of not having access to consistent sources of supply at multiple locations. We believe these customer needs could result in fewer numbers of competitors in the market as our remaining competitors

<<<

 become larger and capable of supplying their services on a more consistent and comprehensive basis.

We may fail to effectively participate in the industry consolidation for a variety of reasons, including antitrust restrictions, which

<<<

 may limit the degree to which a large market participant such as us can acquire additional competitors, as well as our substantial indebtedness. In addition, industry consolidation could make it more difficult for us to maintain operating margins

<<<

 and could also increase competition for our acquisition targets and result in higher purchase price multiples. We may also face increased difficulty in growing and maintaining our market share and increasing our growth prospects.
A majority

<<<

 of our balance sheet assets consist of intangible assets, which are subject to impairment testing and may affect future results of operations.
Our intangible assets are substantial and represented approximately SEK2,276 million as of December

<<<

 31, 2012. Our intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill.
We capitalize goodwill relating to acquisitions, which is calculated as the difference between the historical cost and fair value of an acquired business and the fair value of our

<<<

 share of the acquired business's identifiable net assets at the time of acquisition. Goodwill from the acquisition of operations is recognized as an intangible asset. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and stated at cost less accumulated

<<<

 impairment losses.
Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment testing at least annually. The identification and measurement of impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of reporting units. Accounting for impairment contains

<<<

 uncertainty because management must use judgment in determining appropriate assumptions to be used in the measurement of fair value. The estimates of fair value of reporting units are based on the best information available as of the date of

<<<

 the assessment and incorporate management assumptions about expected future cash flows and contemplate other valuation techniques. For more information see our financial statements included in this Prospectus. An adverse development in our

<<<

 business activities may require us to recognize impairment charges to write off all or a part of the carrying amount of our goodwill and other intangible assets. If an expense or impairment loss must be recognized, it could have a material

<<<

 adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our decentralized management structure requires us to maintain effective internal controls, and if we are not able to continue to do so our business could be adversely

<<<

 impacted.
We have a decentralized management structure, and our business strategy emphasizes local decision-making and responsibility in order to adapt to regional and local conditions. We have grown, in part, due to our acquisitions, which

<<<

 have required us to integrate service providers from a wide range of backgrounds who are accustomed to a range of different practices and policies. We cannot assure you that we will succeed in standardizing and enforcing best practices throughout

<<<

 our group. As a result of the depth and breadth of our operations in Scandinavia and the extent of autonomy that we grant to our local management, we cannot assure you that we will not face considerable challenges in implementing uniform and

<<<

 cohesive management practices in the future or before they negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our decentralized sales, limited legal and compliance structures, geographic breadth and acquisition strategy

<<<

 exposes us to challenges at local levels that we may fail to identify and address in a timely manner.
We operate through a network of approximately 200 local branch offices in 150 locations throughout Scandinavia and our sales processes are

<<<

 not centralized. Our branch offices operate with a high degree of autonomy and we do not control all of their day-to-day business operations. A branch office may procure contracts on unfavorable economic terms or in violation of applicable

<<<

 rules and regulations, such as applicable anti-competition, anti-cartel, anti-bribery and money laundering rules and regulations, for which we could potentially be held liable. In addition, we have historically grown through acquisitions, which

<<<

 have required us to integrate the acquired businesses with a wide range of practices and policies. We may not succeed in integrating the acquired businesses and standardizing and implementing our practices. Given our decentralized sales processes

<<<

, limited legal and compliance structures and the geographic breadth of our operations, substantial problems could arise in the future and we may fail to identify and address problems before they materially adversely affect our business, results

<<<

 of operations and financial condition.
We bear the risk of cost overruns in many of our projects and, as a result, we may experience reduced profits or, in some cases, losses under these projects if the cost increases are above our estimated

<<<

 amounts.
We base our prices for our fixed-price contracts largely upon estimates and assumptions of projected costs, including assumptions about future economic conditions, raw material prices, the availability of labor, equipment and materials

<<<

, and other factors outside of our control. If our estimates or assumptions prove to be inaccurate or if circumstances change in a way that renders our assumptions and estimates inaccurate, we may incur costs higher than those that we estimated

<<<

, cost overruns may occur and we could experience reduced profits or a loss for affected projects. We also are exposed to increases in energy prices and prices for raw materials that we may be unable to pass on to our customers. Additionally

<<<

, in certain circumstances, we guarantee project completion or the achievement of certain acceptance and performance testing levels by a scheduled date. Failure to meet schedule or performance requirements typically results in additional costs

<<<

 to us, and, in some cases, it may create liability for consequential and liquidated damages. Performance problems for existing and future projects could cause our actual results of operations to differ materially from those we anticipate and

<<<

 could damage our reputation within our industry and our customer base.
24

Based on economic and other conditions impacting the markets in which our facilities are located, as well as the overall performance of individual branch locations

<<<

, we may be required to close or dispose of under-performing branches.
We may have to close under-performing branches from time to time as warranted by general economic conditions and/or weakness in the local markets in which we operate. For

<<<

 example, during the global financial crisis beginning in 2008, we closed certain of our branches and terminated the employment of certain of our employees as part of our restructuring and rationalization efforts. In addition, we engage in periodic

<<<

 reviews of branch performance and may decide to close or dispose of branches based on under-performance, poor cash flow and other considerations. Our under-performing branches may not be successful in generating future profits. Future branch

<<<

 closures could result in our reduced presence in certain of our local markets, which could potentially have an adverse effect on our ability to provide our customers comprehensive services throughout Scandinavia, which could adversely impact

<<<

 our reputation and results of operations. In addition, branch closures may result in administrative and restructuring costs that could have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Our success

<<<

 is highly dependent on the ability to recruit and retain technical and other key personnel.
Our future success depends on our ability to continue to identify, attract, train, retain and motivate a sufficient number of highly skilled technical

<<<

 personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense. We may be unable to successfully attract, assimilate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel. Failure to do so could harm our business and growth, and ultimately our profitability. In

<<<

 particular, it may be difficult to find qualified personnel in regions that are experiencing a growth in demand for the services that we provide, such as in Stockholm, Oslo and Copenhagen. In addition, our continued success depends largely

<<<

 on our ability to retain our technical and key personnel. The departure of significant numbers of our highly skilled personnel could impair our ability to execute our business plan and growth strategy, cause a loss of customers, reduce revenues

<<<

 and adversely affect employee morale. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain or attract an adequately skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our business strategy or that labor expenses will not

<<<

 increase as a result of a shortage in the supply of these skilled personnel.
In addition, our activities require a wide range of continually evolving skills in order to keep up with changes in the sectors in which we operate. We may be unable

<<<

 to find qualified candidates, train staff in new methods, and recruit and train managers.
We may also incur significant costs in maintaining employee health and safety requirements and, as our operations expand, we may face increased work accidents

<<<

 and illness (both in frequency and severity). In addition, during periods of rapid economic growth, we may encounter problems in recruiting and retaining qualified employees. We may also experience increased staff costs during these periods

<<<

, or a decrease in the quality of the services we provide, all of which could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our business depends extensively on recruiting and retaining qualified branch managers

<<<

. If we are not able to attract a sufficient number of qualified branch managers, our future growth and financial performance may suffer.
We rely heavily on our branch managers for the success of a branch. Each branch manager has the responsibility

<<<

 for recruiting and retaining a quality workforce and cultivating customer loyalty. Each branch manager manages the operations of the branch, which include recruiting, dispatching and paying of employees, meeting the needs of our customers,

<<<

 maintaining customer satisfaction, selling our services to new customers, as well as controlling costs through accident prevention, and complying with applicable laws and regulations. Our future growth and financial performance depend on our

<<<

 ability to hire, train and retain qualified managers from a limited pool of qualified candidates. If we are unable to attract, retain and successfully train our technicians and branch managers, this could have a materially adverse effect on

<<<

 our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We may incur liabilities for the actions of our employees.
Our employees deliver services within buildings and at locations owned or operated by our customers. As a result, we may

<<<

 be subject to claims in connection with damage to property, business interruptions, unauthorized use of the customer's property or willful misconduct or other tortuous acts by our employees or people who have gained unauthorized access to premises

<<<

 through our business operations. Such claims may be substantial and may result in adverse publicity for our group. Accordingly, these claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition

<<<

.
We may not be able to attract and retain key officers and directors.
Despite our decentralized business model, we also depend upon the services of a small number of key executive officers and directors. There can be no assurance that these

<<<

 individuals will continue to make their services available to us in the future. The loss of or diminution in the services of one or more of our key executive officers or directors, or our inability to attract, retain and maintain new key executive

<<<

 officers or directors, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
25

Our use of the percentage of completion method of accounting could result in a reduction or reversal of previously

<<<

 recorded revenues or profits.
Our net sales from installation and services projects in progress is recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting, which results in our recognizing project revenues and earnings ratably over

<<<

 the project term (without regard to the timing of our receipt of cash payments), in the proportion that actual costs are incurred in relation to estimated total project costs. The earnings or losses recognized on individual projects are based

<<<

 on estimates of project revenue, costs and degree of completion. Project-related expenditures that have been incurred, but for which the goods or service are related to future stages of the project, are not considered when determining the degree

<<<

 of completion. Changes to the scope of the project, claims and incentive pay are included in project revenue to the extent that they have been agreed with the customer and can be reliably measured. Unanticipated delays and unexpected costs

<<<

 may arise in the course of completing a project, including as a result of shortage of skilled labor, the failure of subcontractors to perform as contracted and changes in project specifications. In particular, this may be the case in larger

<<<

, more complex installation projects and fixed price services agreements. We record the effect of revisions to estimated costs, and consequently revenues, once the amounts are known or can be reasonably estimated. These revisions can occur at

<<<

 any time and could be material. An inability by us to accurately estimate these costs may adversely affect our net sales and may require us to adjust the amount of net sales previously recognized. Given the uncertainties associated with these

<<<

 types of contracts, it is possible for actual costs to vary from estimated costs, which may result in the reduction or reversal of previously recorded profits.
As a result of the requirements of the percentage of completion method of accounting

<<<

, the possibility exists, for example, that we could have estimated and reported a profit on a project over several periods and later determined, usually near contract completion, that all or a portion of such previously estimated and reported

<<<

 profits were overstated. If this occurs, the full aggregate amount of the overstatement will be reported for the period in which such determination is made, thereby reducing profits from that project and resulting in an adjustment to earnings

<<<

 recorded for such period, which may lead to a loss being reported. As a result of the uncertainties associated with our projects, actual costs may vary from estimates previously made, which can result in reductions or reversals of previously

<<<

 recorded net sales and profits.
Our success depends on effective project and site management, which could be impaired by a certain number of factors.
For many of our projects, we provide a broad range of services with a high technical content

<<<

. For example, in our installation business, we install complex electrical infrastructure in hospitals and other commercial buildings and in our service business area, we provide maintenance and periodic repair of these installations, for which

<<<

 a high level of technical skill is required. In order to ensure that the projects we take on are effectively conducted and profitable, we need to have a high degree of project and site management expertise, especially in evaluating the costs

<<<

 of providing our services to the relevant customer and in maximizing efficiency in providing the contracted services throughout the term of the contract. Specific factors that can affect our performance and profitability include our ability

<<<

 to accurately determine the costs of providing the contracted services in the context of a particular project, our ability to measure the personnel and other resources that we need to deploy in order to fulfill our contractual obligations on

<<<

 an ongoing basis, our ability to control services provided by subcontractors or to influence the performance of such subcontractors or other service providers, and unforeseen technical difficulties that could cause project delays or unscheduled

<<<

 project downtime.
If, due to ineffective contract planning or management, we are unable to efficiently and profitably render our services, we could experience increased contract execution costs, difficulty in obtaining timely payment for our

<<<

 services or harm to our reputation, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Damage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of

<<<

 operations or prospects.
Our reputation is important to our ability to market our services and secure new customers. Our historical success is attributable, in large part, to our reputation as a leading and reliable provider of a broad range

<<<

 of services, particularly services requiring a certain level of technical expertise, and this reputation has strengthened our business and helped to facilitate our expansion. Although we closely monitor the quality of our services, we cannot

<<<

 guarantee that we will be able to protect our business against damage to our reputation vis-à-vis our customers, potential customers and, more generally, in the geographic regions and business sectors in which we operate. For example, we could

<<<

 be held responsible for an accident at, or a malfunction of, a customer's facilities due to poor performance of our services, or the erroneous perception that the accident or malfunction occurred as a result of our performance of services.

<<<

 Any such event or perception could damage our reputation or brand, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.
We are party to public sector contracts, which may be affected

<<<

 by political and administrative decisions, and we are subject to risks inherent in public contracts.
Public sector customers account for a significant portion of our net sales. For the year ended December 31, 2012, we generated 22% of our total

<<<

 net sales from our public sector customers and a majority of our net sales are attributable, directly or indirectly, to public infrastructure projects. The success and profitability of our public sector business may be influenced by political

<<<

 considerations. It may also be affected by political and administrative decisions concerning levels of public spending. In certain cases, due to applicable regulations, such as European Union tender rules, certain terms of public sector contracts

<<<

, such as pricing terms, contract period, the use of subcontractors and the ability to transfer receivables under contract, provide us with less
26

flexibility than comparable private sector contracts. Public sector contracts can, if entered

<<<

 into or prolonged in violation of applicable tender rules, be declared invalid by a court of law, or if questioned by a third party competitor, risk being terminated by the public sector customer. Certain of our public sector contracts may

<<<

 be subject to challenge on these grounds and could be declared invalid if they are found to be in violation of applicable public procurement law.
Moreover, decisions to decrease public spending may result in the termination or downscaling of

<<<

 public sector contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Historically, our performance has been linked, in part, to the ability and willingness of local, regional and

<<<

 national governments to allocate public funds to infrastructure and other publicly funded projects, as well as our ability to bid successfully for these contracts. Public sector spending, in turn, generally has been dependent on general macroeconomic

<<<

 conditions. A decrease in public sector spending as a result of a deterioration in Scandinavian, European or global economic conditions, changes in governmental policy or other reasons could have an adverse effect on our financial condition

<<<

 and results of operations. We cannot assure you that a fall in public sector spending in the countries in which we operate will not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operation.
Contracts in the public

<<<

 sector are also subject to review and monitoring by local authorities to ensure compliance with laws and regulations prohibiting anti-competitive practices. Although we believe that we comply with these laws and regulations, there can be no

<<<

 assurance that we will not be found in violation of any such laws or regulations, and we could be subject to fines, penalties and other sanctions, including exclusion from participation in tenders for public contracts. Any such event would

<<<

 have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.
Changes in the laws and regulations governing public procurement could have a material impact on our business.
As a government contractor

<<<

, we are subject to a number of procurement regulations, requirements and limitations relating to the conduct of business relationships and the formation of purchasing contracts, including prohibitions on certain business practices that could

<<<

 be construed as bribery, public corruption or unfair competitive practices. Although we maintain policies regarding compliance with these regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, subcontractors, agents and partners, or the

<<<

 public sector entities with whom they contract, will not act in violation of such policies and/or applicable laws and regulations. Furthermore, if a public sector entity were to violate applicable procurement laws or regulations in connection

<<<

 with contracts entered into with us or our marketing activities, the relevant authorities could seek enforcement action against us. Any such violation, even if prohibited by our policies, could result in civil or criminal penalties, the loss

<<<

 of business or harm to our reputation and, accordingly, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
In addition, awards under public procurement processes may be subject to challenge or rescission

<<<

 based on actual or alleged procedural deficiencies in the tender process, even after we have made significant expenditures associated with winning such an award. We (or a public sector customer) may face actions seeking to challenge prior awards

<<<

 and we may not be successful in securing a contract in any re-tendering process, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
A significant part of our net sales is attributable to

<<<

 contracts awarded through a competitive bidding process, which can result in substantial costs and loss of revenue if we fail to compete effectively.
A significant part of our net sales is attributable to contracts that are awarded through

<<<

 a competitive bidding process, in the private as well as public sectors. Competitive bidding results in substantial costs and presents a number of risks, including: substantial investments in terms of cost and managerial time required to prepare

<<<

 bids and proposals for contracts that may or may not be awarded to us; the need to estimate accurately the resources and costs that will be required to service any contracts we are awarded, often in advance of the final determination of their

<<<

 full scope; the expense and delay that may arise if our competitors protest or challenge awards made to us pursuant to a competitive bidding process, and the risk that such protest or challenge could result in the requirement to resubmit bids

<<<

 or in the termination, reduction or modification of the contracts that have been awarded; and the opportunity cost of not bidding on and winning other contracts we might otherwise pursued, all of which could have a material adverse effect on

<<<

 our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Changes in government monetary or fiscal policies may negatively impact our results of operations.
The demand for our products and services is impacted by monetary and other government

<<<

 policies in each of the countries in which we operate, including policies that have the effect of encouraging or discouraging construction, such as longterm interest rates, tax policies, policies encouraging or discouraging labor mobility and

<<<

 migration, the availability of financing or subsidies, the allocation of government funding for public infrastructure programs and safety regulations that encourage or discourage the use of certain materials and products. Interest rate changes

<<<

, for example, affect demand for residential and nonresidential structures, which in turn affects sales of our services that serve these activities. Interest rate changes also affect our customers' ability to finance purchases and can impact

<<<

 the ability of our suppliers to finance the production of parts and components necessary to deliver the services we sell. In addition to changing interest rates, central banks and other policy arms of many countries take actions to vary the

<<<

 amount of liquidity and credit available to such country. Changes in liquidity and credit policies, including the reduction or elimination of favorable tax or other stimulus programs, could adversely impact our customers, markets and suppliers

<<<

, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
27

Fluctuating commodity prices may adversely impact our results of operations.
The prices of petroleum, copper, steel, aluminum

<<<

 and other commodities used in the products we install can be volatile. We are not always able to quickly or effectively react to price increases by our suppliers or pass through increased costs to our customers. A majority of our contracts

<<<

 allow us to pass through cost increases to our customers. However, short-term changes in the costs of raw materials, some of which are subject to significant fluctuations, are not always passed on to our customers. Any delay in our ability

<<<

 to pass on material price increases to our customers could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
In addition, if prices decrease for commodities, we may have inventories purchased at prices

<<<

 higher than prevailing market prices. Prices and the availability of petroleum products are subject to political, economic and market factors that are outside our control. Political events in petroleum-producing regions as well as weather-related

<<<

 events may cause the price of fuel to increase. Any significant increases in fuel or energy prices or increased costs relating to emissions control requirements that have been or may be imposed in the future, particularly due to climate change

<<<

-related legislation, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Significant fluctuations in the cost of the commodities used in products we use as a part of the services that we deliver may

<<<

 adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
We currently do not enter into forward sales, commodity, derivatives or hedging arrangements with respect to our purchase of raw materials and, as a result, we may be exposed

<<<

 to the impact of any significant increase in the price such materials.
Our businesses may be affected by changes in the market prices of certain raw materials such as petroleum, copper, steel and aluminum. While we generally attempt to pass

<<<

 price increases of raw materials through to our customers, we do not currently enter into forward sales, commodity, derivative or hedging arrangements to establish a price in advance for the purchase of future raw materials. As a result, we

<<<

 may realize the benefit of any short-term decrease in raw material prices, but we are not protected against increases in the price of raw materials. If the prices for certain raw materials increase significantly, our profits may be materially

<<<

 adversely affected.
Any failure of our third-party subcontractors to satisfactorily perform their obligations may hurt our reputation, business and results of operations.
We offer certain of our services to our customers through various third

<<<

-party service providers engaged to perform these services on our behalf. However, we retain responsibility for the work performed by these subcontractors. Accordingly, we are exposed to risks relating to managing subcontractors and the risk

<<<

 that these subcontractors may fail to perform the agreedupon services satisfactorily and on a timely basis, which could affect our ability to perform our obligations or meet our customers' expectations and comply with applicable regulatory

<<<

 requirements. In extreme cases, performance or other deficiencies on the part of our subcontractors could result in a customer terminating our contract. A termination could expose us to financial liabilities, damage our reputation and impair

<<<

 our ability to compete for future contracts. In addition, in the event a subcontractor provides unsatisfactory services on our behalf, we could be required to make additional investments or provide additional services to ensure the adequate

<<<

 performance and delivery of the contracted services. In addition, we are exposed to the operational controls of our subcontractors, including with respect to the qualifications of their personnel and their compliance with labor and immigration

<<<

 laws. Our subcontractors may maintain inadequate insurance coverage or inadequate financial resources to honor claims resulting from damages or losses inflicted by such subcontractors on our customers.
We constantly manage and monitor the performance

<<<

 of our subcontractors. However, the failure of subcontractors to meet their contractual obligations or comply with applicable laws or regulations could harm our reputation, as well as result in customer losses and financial liabilities, any

<<<

 of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We rely on third-party suppliers, and if we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers

<<<

, or if there is a significant interruption in our supply chains or significant fluctuation in the prices of our product supply, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
Our ability to offer a wide variety of services to our customers

<<<

 is dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate product supply from manufacturers or other suppliers at attractive prices. For the year ended December 31, 2012, we estimate that our top ten suppliers accounted for 32% of our total supply costs

<<<

. We may not be able to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers that can satisfy our standards for quality and price and our need to access products and supplies in a timely and efficient manner. We may be required to replace

<<<

 a supplier if its products do not meet our quality, price or safety standards. Our results of operations and inventory levels could suffer if we are unable to promptly replace a supplier that is unwilling or unable to satisfy our requirements

<<<

 with a supplier providing similar products. The loss of, or substantial decrease in the availability of, products from our suppliers, or the loss of a key supplier, could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition

<<<

 and cash flows.
In addition, supply interruptions could arise from shortages of raw materials, labor disputes or weather conditions affecting products or shipments, transportation disruptions or other factors beyond our control. Short-term

<<<

 and long-term disruptions in our supply chain would result in a need to maintain higher inventory levels as we replace similar products, a higher cost of goods and ultimately a decrease in our net sales and profitability. A disruption in the

<<<

 timely availability of our goods by our key suppliers and the failure by our suppliers to continue to supply us with products on commercially reasonable terms, or at
28

all, may result in a decline of our operating margins and have a material

<<<

 adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.
The cost of our services have historically been volatile and subject to fluctuations arising from changes in supply and demand, economic conditions, labor

<<<

 costs, competition, market speculation, government regulation and trade policies, as well as from periodic delays in the delivery of our products. We have a limited ability to control the timing and amount of changes to prices that we will

<<<

 pay for our products. In addition, the supply of our products fluctuates based on available manufacturing capacity. A shortage of capacity, or excess capacity, in the industry can result in significant increases or decreases in market prices

<<<

 for those products, often within a short period of time. Even where we are able to increase our prices to our customers, we may be unable to increase our prices in sufficient time to absorb price increases by our suppliers. Such price fluctuations

<<<

 can adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
We are dependent on our relationships with strategic partners in the building and services industry, including NCC, Skanska and PEAB, the three largest

<<<

 construction companies in Scandinavia. The failure to maintain these relationships could result in the loss of business and, as a result, materially adverse effects on our operating performance.
Our business, particularly with respect to installation

<<<

 in new construction projects, is dependent in large part on our long-standing relationships with leading Scandinavian construction companies. Our opportunities to partner with these companies could be adversely affected if: we are unable to

<<<

 achieve the objectives under our arrangements in a timely manner, or at all; our partners become unable, unwilling or less willing to invest in new property development due to poor general market conditions, their financial condition or other

<<<

 circumstances, many of which are beyond our control; we disagree with a key partner regarding strategic direction, the economics of our relationship or other matters; we are unable to successfully manage multiple simultaneous projects with

<<<

 such partners; our strategic partners breach or terminate their contract with us; our partners become competitors of ours or enter into agreements with our competitors; applicable laws and regulations, domestic or foreign, impede our ability

<<<

 to enter into strategic arrangements; or as we enter into additional or consolidation in the construction markets limits the number of potential industry partners. In particular, we are a subcontractor to Skanska in connection with a turn-key

<<<

 electrical and plumbing supply contract relating to the construction of Statoil's new facilities in Bergen, Norway. Under the contract we, along with all of the other subcontractors, have agreed to accept joint and several liability for the

<<<

 performance of Skanska's obligations under the supply contract. Pursuant to an agreement among the subcontractors, we bear responsibility for and potential liability in respect of ventilation works and electrical installations. To the extent

<<<

 Skanska encounters financial difficulties or otherwise becomes unable to perform its obligations under the construction contract, we may incur substantial liabilities, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations

<<<

 and financial condition. If any of these events occur, or if we fail to maintain our agreements with our strategic partners and collaborators, we may not be able to commercialize our existing and future products, further develop our business

<<<

 or generate sufficient revenues to support our operations. Additionally, our business could be negatively impacted if any of our industry partners undergo a change of control, assign the rights or obligations under any of our agreements or

<<<

 cease to be a going concern.
We may be exposed to the credit risk of certain of our customers and, in addition, our liability to customers under guarantee provisions may materially and adversely affect our earnings.
We sell installation and

<<<

 services solutions to our customers through contracts that are not secured by collateral or other security and therefore bear the risk that our customers will be unable to pay amounts due to us. Our products are sold to customers in industries

<<<

 that may experience fluctuations in demand based on economic conditions, energy prices, seasonality, consumer demand and other factors beyond our control. These industries include the construction industry. We may not be able to limit our potential

<<<

 loss of revenues if a significant number of customers are unable to pay amounts due to us on a timely basis, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
At the same time, we generally

<<<

 provide guarantees for completed projects as to the proper operation and conformance to specifications of our installations and services. The failure of our installations to operate properly or to meet specifications may increase our costs

<<<

 by requiring additional engineering resources and services, the replacement of parts and equipment or monetary reimbursement to a customer. We have in the past received guarantee claims, are subject to guarantee claims and we expect to continue

<<<

 to receive them in the future. To the extent that we incur substantial guarantee claims in any period, our reputation, our ability to obtain future business and our earnings could be adversely affected.
In 2009, as part of our acquisition of

<<<

 Siemens' installation business in Norway, we acceded to a contract with Kolo Veidekke relating to installation and ongoing maintenance of electrical systems as part of the construction of a new highway. Under the terms of the original contract

<<<

, Siemens accepted liability for any errors or defects in the electrical system that may occur during the 26 years following the execution of the contract. Contractual liability under the guarantee is limited to NOK57 million (approximately

<<<

 8 million). Negligence and tort claims are subject to a higher limitation of NOK250 million (approximately 33 million). To the extent claims are brought against us under the guarantee, we could incur substantial liability and harm to our reputation

<<<

, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our competitive position could be adversely affected by changes in technology and industry standards.
Our business requires a high level

<<<

 of technical expertise for a wide variety of services. We need to constantly adapt our expertise in response to technological innovations, as well as industry standards, product instructions and customer requirements.
29

New technology or

<<<

 changes in industry and customer requirements may render some of our services obsolete, excessively costly or otherwise unmarketable.
As a result, we must continuously enhance our expertise and the efficiency and reliability of our services

<<<

 in order to remain at the forefront of industry standards and customer requirements. If we are unable to adapt to ever-changing technologies and customer requirements in a timely and cost-effective manner, our competitive position will suffer

<<<

 and our prospects for growth will be impaired, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations.
A change in supplier rebates due to the loss of our leading market position or other market conditions or a deterioration in

<<<

 our commercial relationship with one or more key suppliers could adversely affect our income and gross margins.
The terms on which we purchase products from many of our suppliers enable us to receive a rebate based on the volume of our purchases

<<<

. These rebates effectively reduce our costs. Our ability to earn and negotiate rebates is critical to the success of our business. If market conditions change or if we lose our leading market position, suppliers may respond by changing the

<<<

 terms of some or all of these purchasing programs to our detriment. Any such changes could lower our gross margins or revenues. Furthermore, a loss of market share could result in a decreased demand for our services, which could cause our volume

<<<

 requirements for certain products to decline. If we are unable to meet specified volume thresholds for certain suppliers, we may not receive favorable rebates, which could increase our costs and decrease our gross margins.
In addition, some

<<<

 of our suppliers are not obligated under long-term supply agreements to continue to sell to us. We have relatively few sources of supply for some of the products that we purchase, particularly, with respect to lighting installations, and in

<<<

 some cases we rely on a small group of suppliers for certain key products. In addition, the lead time involved in the manufacturing of some of these components can be lengthy. If certain of our key suppliers become unwilling or unable to supply

<<<

 us with components meeting our requirements, we may not be able to organize additional or replacement suppliers in a timely manner, or at all. Moreover, we maintain low levels of inventory and our suppliers deliver directly to our work sites

<<<

, which prevents us from being able to provide replacement supplies on our own should one or more or our suppliers fail to meet our supply requirements. The inability or unwillingness of our suppliers to provide timely delivery of products necessary

<<<

 for our installations and services projects could cause our services to be disrupted and our results of operations to decline.
Our operations could be adversely affected if a significant number of our customers terminate their services contracts

<<<

 prior to the end of the contractual term or select another provider following the expiration of their contracts.
We perform the majority of our work for customers under contracts with a stated term and, in some cases, with termination clauses

<<<

 permitting the customer to cancel the contract at the customer's discretion following the expiration of an agreed notice period. There can be no assurance that our customers will not exercise their rights to terminate their contracts prior

<<<

 to expiration or that we will be successful in negotiating new contracts with customers as such contracts expire. We generally execute our business through numerous small contracts (including multiple contracts for the same customers) and,

<<<

 therefore, any cancellation of a contract or a number of contracts would not ordinarily have an adverse effect on our results of operations. However, contract cancellations or dissatisfaction with our services may damage our reputation and

<<<

 make it more difficult for us to obtain similar contracts with other customers, in which case our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.
Amounts included in our estimated order backlog may not result in actual revenue

<<<

 or translate into profits, and our estimated order backlog is subject to cancellation and unexpected adjustments and is therefore an uncertain indicator of future results of operations.
As of December 31, 2012, our order backlog was SEK4,8

<<<

09 million, which represented 82% of our installation net sales for the year ended December 31, 2012, and as of March 31, 2013, our order backlog was SEK4,914 million, which included net sales likely to occur beyond 2013 and represented 85%

<<<

 of our installation net sales for the twelve months ended March 31, 2013. These order backlog amounts are based on our estimates and therefore may not result in an actual recognition of revenue within the period initially anticipated, if at

<<<

 all. In addition, certain contracts included in our estimated order backlog may not be profitable. We may experience variances in the realization of our estimated order backlog because of project delays or cancellations resulting from weather

<<<

 conditions, project deferrals or delays, scope adjustments, external market factors and economic factors beyond our control. If our estimated order backlog fails to materialize as we anticipated, our business, financial condition or results

<<<

 of operations would be materially and adversely affected. Accordingly, our estimated order backlog as of any particular date is an uncertain indicator of future revenue or earnings.
We may incur liabilities that are not covered by insurance

<<<

.
We carry insurance of various types, including workers' compensation, employment practices, pension-related and general liability coverage. While we seek to maintain appropriate levels of insurance, not all claims are insurable and there can

<<<

 be no assurance that we will not experience major incidents that are not covered by our insurance. Furthermore, the occurrence of several events resulting in substantial claims for damages within a calendar year may have a material adverse

<<<

 effect on our business. In addition, our insurance costs may increase over time in response to any negative development in our claims history or due to material price increases in the insurance market in general. There can be no assurance that

<<<

 we will be able to maintain our current insurance coverage or do so at a reasonable cost.
30

We may not be able to successfully defend against claims made against us by customers or other third parties, or we may fail to adequately recover

<<<

 on our claims against customers or third parties.
We may encounter difficulties in meeting contractual performance obligations, which may result in the incurrence of penalties for non-performance or a delay in the performance of our contractual

<<<

 obligations. In addition, we rely on third-party partners, equipment manufacturers and subcontractors to complete some of our contracts. As such, claims involving customers, suppliers and subcontractors may be brought against us, and by us

<<<

, in connection with our contracts or with customers' internal procedures. Claims brought against us could include back charges for alleged defective or incomplete work, breaches of warranty and/or late completion of the project and claims for

<<<

 cancelled projects. The claims and back charges can involve actual damages, as well as contractually agreed-upon liquidated sums. These claims, as well as claims we may make against customers or other third parties, if not resolved through

<<<

 negotiation, could result in lengthy and expensive litigation or arbitration proceedings.
We occasionally bring claims against project owners for additional costs that exceed the contract price or for amounts not included in the original contract

<<<

 price, including change orders. These types of claims occur due to matters such as ownercaused delays, increased unit prices or changes from the initial project scope that result, both directly and indirectly, in additional costs. Often, these

<<<

 claims can be the subject of lengthy arbitration, litigation or third-party expert proceedings, and it can be difficult to accurately predict when these claims will be fully resolved. When these types of events occur and unresolved claims are

<<<

 pending, we may invest significant working capital in projects to cover cost overruns pending the resolution of the relevant claims. Charges associated with claims, or our failure to recover sufficient damages and/or liquidated sums in connection

<<<

 with claims we bring against third parties, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
If we fail to ensure safe work environments for our employees, we could be exposed to significant financial

<<<

 losses, as well as civil and criminal liabilities.
Our operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to the maintenance of safe conditions in the workplace. The industry in which we operate involves a certain degree of operational

<<<

 risk, such as working with high voltages, heat and at heights, which cannot be fully eliminated by procedures implemented to address them. These hazards can cause personal injury or death, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment

<<<

 and other consequential damages and could lead to the suspension of operations and large damage claims and, in extreme cases, criminal liability.
In December 2011, for example, Bravida Danmark A/S received a notice from the Danish Working Environment

<<<

 Service (Arbejdstilsynet), in connection with its visit to a construction site where we are conducting operations, informing us that asbestos had been found on the site. In addition, in November 2011, the Danish Working Environment Service

<<<

 served another notice to Bravida Danmark A/S with respect to a separate site warning of a risk of building collapse on the site. Although no further action was taken by the Danish Working Environment Service in either of these instances, if

<<<

 we were to fail to implement any safety or other procedures with respect to these or other sites, or if the procedures we implement were deemed to be ineffective, our employees or others may suffer injury and we could incur significant financial

<<<

 losses. In addition, we could be found liable for failing to comply with government regulation dealing with occupational health and safety. Occurrence of any of these events could cause a materially adverse effect on our operations and profitability

<<<

.
Our failure, or the failure of one of our subcontractors, to comply with applicable regulations or to maintain a safe work environment could result in substantial fines, claims relating to violations of social and working environment legislation

<<<

 or the revocation of licenses. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to claims relating to employees' working conditions. Any such claims, or increased costs resulting from such claims or regulatory changes, could have a material

<<<

 adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
New technology and the implementation of new work processes, services, tools and machinery may have unforeseen effects on the working conditions of our employees

<<<

. In addition, our employees may be exposed to materials that, although not currently considered harmful, could in the future be deemed health hazards, as was the case with asbestos. Unsafe work sites also have the potential to increase project

<<<

 costs for our customers and raise our operating costs. Any of the foregoing could result in financial losses, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Compliance with existing

<<<

 laws and regulations or changes in any such laws and regulations could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We are subject to numerous international, EU, national and local laws, regulations and ordinances and

<<<

 must observe a large number of different regulatory systems across a number of jurisdictions that change frequently, continuously evolve and become more stringent. Such regulations include those relating to occupational health and safety and

<<<

 the services we deliver. For example, our services must comply with the various building codes and regulations in the countries in which we operate and must satisfy certain quality and safety requirements resulting from national and international

<<<

 standards, including EU directives, and regulations and standards adopted by international organizations. We are also subject to laws and regulations, and must hold permits, relating to the storage, handling and disposal of potentially hazardous

<<<

 wastes and materials, including asbestos, refrigerants, adhesives, oil and other petroleum-based products, and electrical and electronic equipment waste and storage, handling and disposal problems may occur. Moreover, under certain of our leases

<<<

, we are responsible for remediation of any environmental contamination, irrespective of whether we caused the contamination.
31

Failure to adopt appropriate internal compliance policies or to ensure compliance with our policies and the law

<<<

 may result in fines or enforcement actions against us. Compliance with existing and additional or more stringent laws, regulations, ordinances or permit requirements, as well as more vigorous enforcement policies of regulatory agencies or stricter

<<<

 or different interpretations, may require us to make additional expenditures or investments, which may be material, and could also otherwise affect our business in a way that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition

<<<

 and results of operations.
Our operations and future growth may be affected by competition regulations.
We are subject to competition laws and regulations at the national and supranational level. In jurisdictions where we have a leading market

<<<

 position, these laws and regulations may reduce our operational flexibility and limit our ability to make additional acquisitions and implement our strategy.
In general, these laws are designed to preserve free and open competition in the marketplace

<<<

 in order to enhance competitiveness and economic efficiency. From time to time in the past, we have been, and in the future we may become, subject to investigations and proceedings by national and supranational competition and antitrust authorities

<<<

, as well as claims from private third parties, for alleged infringements of competition or antitrust laws. This may result in judgments, fines or other forms of liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business

<<<

, financial condition and results of operations.
Although we have issued internal guidelines concerning compliance with competition laws and regulations, individual local managers may act against our instructions and either inadvertently or

<<<

 deliberately violate applicable competition laws and regulations by engaging in prohibited activities such as price fixing or colluding with competitors regarding markets or customers. Such actions may harm our reputation and, if we are held

<<<

 responsible, the resulting fines and other sanctions could be substantial. Therefore, the occurrence of any such incidents may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Failure to comply

<<<

 with transfer pricing regulations may result in the payment of additional tax or penalties by us.
The markets in which we operate have transfer pricing regulations that require transactions involving associated companies to be at arm's length

<<<

. Arrangements between members of our group, such as intra-group transactions involving management services, royalties, information technology service fees, cash-pool arrangements, intra-group loans and consultancy fees, are typically carried

<<<

 out on an arm's-length basis. However, if the tax authorities in any relevant jurisdiction do not regard such arrangements as being made on an arm's-length basis and successfully challenge those arrangements, the amount of tax payable by the

<<<

 relevant member or members of our group, in respect of both current and previous years, may increase materially and penalties or interest may be payable. Furthermore, any failure to file transfer pricing documentation evidencing the outcome

<<<

 of applied pricing principles, should they be requested by the relevant tax authorities, may result in penalties.
We are exposed to risks in connection with derivative instruments and hedging transactions.
We use derivative financial instruments

<<<

 (primarily currency and interest rate swaps and interest rate ceilings) to help limit and control foreign exchange and interest rate risks. Such transactions involve risks, particularly, if the interest or exchange rate development differs

<<<

 from expectations. The projections and assumptions made by our risk management team at the time when such transactions were entered into could prove to be incorrect and the transactions could fail to limit the risks as intended or increase

<<<

 our costs. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2012, we did not recognize any accruals or contingent losses in our financial statements

<<<

 relating to our derivative instruments.
In addition, we intend to hedge some or all of our interest rate and currency risk under the Notes. Such hedges are senior obligations of the Issuer and rank pari passu in right of payment with the Notes

<<<

 and obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, and together with the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility are secured by first-priority security interests over the Collateral; provided, however, that, under the terms of the Intercreditor

<<<

 Agreement, the Notes will not receive the Collateral; provided, however, that, under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, certain hedges are "super senior" in terms of the receipt of the proceeds of enforcement of Collateral until such

<<<

 super senior hedges and obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility have been repaid in full. See "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements--Intercreditor Agreement." If we were to default in making payments under the Notes, or if

<<<

 certain other credit events were to occur in relation to us and a credit-linked hedge of interest rate or currency risk in respect of such Notes were to terminate or be closed out as a result, then, in relation to the mark-tomarket ("MTM")

<<<

 value which would normally be payable by one party to the other on a termination or close-out of an equivalent hedge that was not credit-linked, either (a) we will be limited, where such MTM value would otherwise be payable to us, in claiming

<<<

 against our hedge counterparty in respect of such termination or close-out to an amount equal to the product of (i) such MTM value and (ii) the credit recovery rate for holders of the Notes, such credit recovery rate being determined within

<<<

 a reasonable period after such termination or close-out by reference to a market auction process or market quotations for such notes, or (b) no MTM payment in respect of such termination or close-out will be due from either party, depending

<<<

 on the particular type of credit-linked hedge into which we enter.
32

We are exposed to translation risk of currency fluctuations.
Our business operations are characterized by a relatively low level of transactional currency risk since our

<<<

 purchases and sales are made in the same local currency with minimal exposure to imported components. From an accounting perspective, we are exposed to risks relating to translation into Swedish kronor of income statements and balance sheets

<<<

 of foreign subsidiaries with local reporting denominated in Danish kroner and Norwegian kroner. In order to prepare our consolidated financial statements, we must translate foreign currency assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses into Swedish

<<<

 kronor. For balance sheet items, foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates applicable on the transaction date. For income statement items, foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency

<<<

 at the average exchange rate applicable to the period. Consequently, increases and decreases in the value of the Swedish krona against other currencies affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their

<<<

 value has not changed in their original currency. A 10% strengthening of the Norwegian krone as of December 31, 2012 would have had a positive translation effect on equity of SEK39 million and the same increase in value of the Danish krone

<<<

 would have had a positive translation effect on equity of SEK17 million. The translation differences from the translation of foreign operations for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012 had a negative impact of SEK54.0 million (

<<<

5.7 million), SEK5.0 million (0.6 million) and SEK12.0 million (1.4 million), respectively, on our total earnings.
The trend toward greater outsourcing of services and maintenance by public institutions and private companies may slow or reverse

<<<

, which could adversely affect our business, including our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.
Growth in demand for technical services is also influenced by trends other than macroeconomic trends, including

<<<

 outsourcing. Over the past several years, our business has benefited from increased levels of the outsourcing of installation and services activities by public institutions and private companies. The development of outsourced services may be

<<<

 affected by political decisions, public opinion, positive and negative experiences with outsourcing, and demand by public institutions and private users. These factors may negatively impact growth, cause contracts to be discontinued or reduce

<<<

 our ability to achieve satisfactory growth rates in the future, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
The residential, non-residential and infrastructure

<<<

 construction markets are seasonal and our business operations may be affected by adverse weather conditions.
We experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for certain of our services, due primarily to weather and holiday seasons. Although

<<<

 weather patterns affect our results of operations throughout the year, cold and wet weather during the winter months has historically reduced construction activity primarily in the first quarter in our markets. In contrast, our highest volume

<<<

 of net sales historically has occurred in September through November. Generally, during the winter months, new construction activity declines due to inclement weather and to the holiday season. Public holidays and vacation, particularly in

<<<

 the months of June and July, also have seasonality effects, because building projects or industrial production processes may slow or temporarily cease. As a result, our results of operations may vary significantly from period to period. We

<<<

 anticipate that fluctuations from period to period will continue in the future.
In addition, adverse weather conditions, particularly during the winter season, could affect the ability of our employees to perform efficient work outdoors in

<<<

 certain regions of Sweden, Denmark and Norway. For example, cold weather is less favorable for construction projects and delays installation work because it hinders site accessibility. We may experience reduced cash flow if unseasonal weather

<<<

 conditions persist, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
We have exposure to customers in the mining and energy industries.
For the year ended December 31, 2012, we derived

<<<

 approximately 1.1% of our net sales from our customers who operate in the mining industry and 0.5% from our customers who operate in the oil and gas industry. These industries have in the past, and may in the future, be negatively impacted

<<<

 by adverse macroeconomic conditions. If a significant downturn in the mining or oil and gas industry were to occur, the cash flows of our customers in this industry would be adversely impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on

<<<

 the demand for our services and consequently our results of operations.
Despite the beginning of an economic recovery in the countries in which we operate, certain regions, particularly Denmark, continue to suffer from economic weakness, which

<<<

 may in turn place pressure on our customers, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
The pace of recovery from the global economic downturn has been slow in some of the regions

<<<

 in which we operate, and the economy of Denmark, in particular, which is one of our principal markets, continues to be affected by low consumer confidence, low home values, prolonged foreclosure activity, a weak housing market, high levels

<<<

 of unemployment and reduced access to consumer credit. In addition, repercussions from the ongoing European debt crisis could further damage the Danish economy as well as the economy of other Scandinavian countries. While these factors are

<<<

 outside of our control, they directly affect our business. The slow pace of recovery in Denmark, or a new cycle of economic downturn, could cause our current and potential customers in Denmark to delay their purchases or affect their ability

<<<

 to pay, which could reduce our future net sales, results of operations and cash flows.
33

The eurozone debt crisis and related market perceptions concerning the instability of the euro, the potential re-introduction of individual currencies

<<<

 within the eurozone, or the potential dissolution of the euro entirely, could adversely affect our business and our financial performance.
Recent developments in the eurozone have exacerbated the ongoing global economic crisis. Financial markets

<<<

 and the supply of credit may continue to be negatively impacted by ongoing fears surrounding the sovereign debts and/or fiscal deficits of several countries in Europe (primarily Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Cyprus and Spain), the possibility

<<<

 of further downgrading, or defaults on, sovereign debt, concerns about a slowdown in growth in certain economies and uncertainties regarding the overall stability of the euro and the sustainability of the euro as a single currency given the

<<<

 diverse economic and political circumstances in individual Member States. Governments and regulators have implemented austerity programs and other remedial measures to respond to the eurozone debt crisis and stabilize the financial system,

<<<

 but the actual impact of such programs and measures are difficult to predict.
If the eurozone debt crisis is not resolved, it is possible that one or more countries may default on their debt obligations and/or cease using the euro and re-establish

<<<

 their own national currency, or that the eurozone may collapse. If such an event were to occur, it is possible that there would be significant, extended and generalized market dislocation, which may have a material adverse effect on our business

<<<

, results of operations and financial condition, especially because our operations are primarily in Europe. In addition, the departure of one or more countries from the eurozone may lead to the imposition of, among other things, exchange rate

<<<

 control laws. Should the euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of eurodenominated obligations and for parties subject to other contractual provisions referencing the euro would be determined by laws in effect

<<<

 at such time. These potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could adversely affect our trading environment and/or the value of the Notes, could have adverse consequences for us with respect to our

<<<

 outstanding debt obligations that are euro-denominated and, because we have a substantial amount of debt denominated in euro, our financial condition may be materially affected.
We are subject to risks associated with operations in multiple

<<<

 countries and our international business operations expose us to a number of difficulties in dealing with multiple regulatory environments.
We have substantial operations, property, plant and equipment in multiple countries. As a result, we

<<<

 are subject to risks associated with conducting our operations in multiple countries, including:
· difficulties in coordinating projects across multiple regions, and staffing and managing foreign operations;
· protectionist laws and business

<<<

 practices that favor local competitors;
· the imposition of or increases in customs duties and other tariffs;
· increased costs of providing customer support for our projects in multiple languages;
· the imposition of or increases in investment

<<<

 or trade restrictions or trade sanctions;
· the interruption of transportation flow for delivery of products to us and services by us to our end-market consumers;
· currency devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates;
· the inability

<<<

 to definitively determine or satisfy local, regional and national legal requirements, the inability to effectively enforce contract or legal rights and the inability to obtain complete financial or other information under local legal, judicial

<<<

, regulatory, disclosure and other systems; and
· the nationalization or expropriation of assets, and other risks which could result from a change in government or government policy, or from other political, social or economic instability.
We

<<<

 cannot assure you that such risks will not have a material adverse effect on us or that we would be able to mitigate such material adverse effects in the future. In addition to the factors noted above, our results of operations and financial

<<<

 condition are affected by inflation, deflation and stagflation in each country in which we have facilities. We cannot assure you that future increases in our costs will not exceed the rate of inflation or the amounts, if any, by which we may

<<<

 be able to increase prices for our products.
Changes in tax laws or challenges to our tax position could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
We are subject to complex tax laws in each of the jurisdictions in

<<<

 which we operate. Changes in tax laws could adversely affect our tax position, including our effective tax rate or tax payments. In addition, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian and European and other international tax laws and regulations are extremely

<<<

 complex and are subject to varying interpretations. We often rely on generally available interpretations of tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We cannot be certain that the relevant tax authorities are in agreement

<<<

 with our interpretation of these laws. If our tax positions are challenged by relevant tax authorities, the imposition of additional taxes could require us to pay taxes that we currently do not collect or pay
34

or increase the costs of our

<<<

 services to track and collect such taxes, which could increase our costs of operations and have a negative effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
We occupy most of our facilities under short- and medium

<<<

-term leases. We may be unable to renew leases at the end of their terms. If we close a facility, we remain obligated under the applicable lease.
Most of our facilities are located in leased premises. Most of our leases are non-cancellable and

<<<

 short- or medium-term. We believe that leases we enter into in the future will likely be on similar terms as our current leases. We may be unable to renew our leases at the end of their terms, or the terms of such renewal may be less favorable

<<<

 to us than those under the current leases. If we close a facility, we generally remain committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease, which includes the payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term. Over the

<<<

 course of the last few years, we closed a number of facilities for which we remain liable on the lease obligations. Our obligation to continue making rent payments in respect of leases for closed facilities could have a material adverse effect

<<<

 on our business and results of operations.
Our operating lease commitments could restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions.
Our annual leasing costs for the year ended December 31, 2012 was approximately

<<<

 SEK191.3 million. In the event we experience a significant decline in activity, our operating lease payment obligations may adversely affect operations and limit our growth. Our level of operating lease payments may negatively impact our operations

<<<

 by increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions and impairing our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes

<<<

. These restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows, and the ability to satisfy the obligations under the Notes.
A failure to maintain and continuously improve our

<<<

 information technology and operational systems to support the anticipated growth and improvements in our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.
In order to manage our growth and improve our performance

<<<

, we must maintain and continuously upgrade and improve our operational systems and processes. Our current information technology system is highly customized, and upgrades and improvements may be costly and disruptive to our business. We may

<<<

 not be able to develop and implement, on a timely basis, projects, systems, procedures and controls required to support the growth and development of our operations. If we are unable to manage our growth and improve our performance, our business

<<<

, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.
We rely on information technology systems that allow us to track and bill our services, communicate with our customers, manage our employees and gather information

<<<

 upon which our management makes decisions regarding our business. The administration of our business is increasingly dependent on the use of these systems. As a result, system failures or disruptions resulting from disasters, computer viruses

<<<

, hackers or other causes could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, pursuant to contracts with third-party vendors, we outsource the operation and maintenance of certain of our information technology systems to seek

<<<

 to ensure effective management of our information technology resources, as well as to improve the cost efficiency of our information technology infrastructure, systems and applications. We rely on the ability of our outsourcing partners to

<<<

 deliver agreed services. Their failure to perform satisfactorily could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We may be required to make further contributions to our pension schemes if

<<<

 the value of pension fund assets is not sufficient to cover potential obligations.
Our white-collar employees in Sweden are covered by a defined benefit pension plan, which is accounted for in accordance with IAS 19, under which we are required

<<<

 to provide agreed benefits to current and former employees. In Norway, employees of Siemens Installation AS, which we acquired in 2009, were previously covered by a defined benefit pension plan. In 2010, these employees were transferred to

<<<

 the same defined contribution pension plan as our other employees in Norway. However, the legacy defined benefit pension plan still applies to a small number of employees.
"Pensions risk" is the risk that the assets of our various defined benefit

<<<

 pension schemes, which are long-term in nature, will not fully match the timing and amount of the schemes' liabilities, as a result of which we would be required or choose to make additional contributions to the schemes. Pension scheme liabilities

<<<

 vary with changes to long-term interest rates, inflation, pensionable salaries and the longevity of scheme members. Changes to local legislation and regulations relating to defined benefit plan funding requirements may also result in significant

<<<

 deviations in the timing and size of the expected cash contributions under such plans. For the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded a net benefit cost of SEK21.8 million to our income statement and paid cash contributions of SEK5 million

<<<

 in respect of our defined benefit pension arrangements. As of December 31, 2012, the value of our unfunded pension plan obligations was SEK25 million.
In addition, subject to European Union endorsement, for accounting periods beginning on or

<<<

 after January 1, 2013, there will be a number of changes to IAS 19, the IFRS pensions accounting standard. These changes result in higher pension costs which would have an adverse effect on our operating profit.
35

Work stoppages or strikes

<<<

 could adversely affect our business.
The majority of our employees are members of unions, and most of our employees who work in our warehouses are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We may encounter strikes or other disturbances,

<<<

 or threats of strikes or disturbances occasioned by our unionized labor force and, upon the expiration of existing collective bargaining agreements, we may be unable to reach new collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms or without

<<<

 work stoppages, strikes or similar industrial actions. Our inability to negotiate satisfactory terms for new agreements would likely cause our labor costs to increase, which would negatively affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass

<<<

 the additional costs on to our customers. When we acquire companies and integrate them into our existing operations, we frequently enter into negotiations to restructure or reduce the workforce at the acquired company. We may experience lengthier

<<<

 consultations or even strikes, work stoppages or other industrial actions in the future, particularly when we are engaged in restructuring and reducing our workforce. Any industrial action or threat thereof could disrupt our operations, possibly

<<<

 for a significant period of time, and result in increased wages and benefits or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Risks Related to Our Structure
The Issuer and certain of

<<<

 the Guarantors are holding companies with no revenue-generating operations of their own and are dependent upon cash flow from subsidiaries to meet their obligations on the Notes and the Note Guarantees, respectively.
The Issuer, Bravida Installation

<<<

 och Service AB, Scandinavian Installation Refi AB and Scandinavian Installation Acquisition AB are each holding companies with no independent business operations or significant operating assets other than investments in their subsidiaries.

<<<

 Each of these holding companies depends upon the receipt of sufficient funds from its subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including the Notes. If our operating subsidiaries do not provide funds to the Issuer to make scheduled payments on

<<<

 the Notes, we do not expect the Issuer to have any other source of funds that would allow it to make payments to the holders of the Notes.
Various agreements governing our debt may restrict and, in some cases may actually prohibit, the ability

<<<

 of these subsidiaries to move cash within their restricted group. Applicable tax laws may also subject such payments to further taxation. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted under applicable law to, make distributions

<<<

 or advance upstream loans to the Issuer or the Guarantors.
The inability to transfer cash among entities within their respective consolidated groups may mean that even though the entities, in aggregate, may have sufficient resources to meet

<<<

 their obligations, they may not be permitted to make the necessary transfers from one entity in their restricted group to another entity in their restricted group in order to make payments to the entity owing the obligations.
The Notes and

<<<

 each of the Note Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to present and future liabilities of our nonGuarantor subsidiaries.
Not all of our subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. Generally, claims of creditors of a non-Guarantor subsidiary

<<<

, including trade creditors and claims of preference shareholders (if any) of the subsidiary, will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiary over the claims of creditors of its parent entity, including claims by

<<<

 holders of the Notes under the Notes or the Note Guarantees. Accordingly, in the event of any foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, administration, reorganization or other insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding of any of our non-Guarantor

<<<

 subsidiaries, holders of their indebtedness and their trade creditors will generally be entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of those subsidiaries before any assets are made available for distribution to its parent entity. As

<<<

 such, the Notes and each Note Guarantee will each be structurally subordinated to the creditors (including trade creditors) and preference shareholders (if any) of our, the Issuer's or the applicable Guarantor's non-Guarantor subsidiaries.

For the twelve months ended March 31, 2013 on a Recalculation Basis, the Guarantors represented 93.0% of our consolidated net sales and 90.7% of our consolidated EBITDA and as of March 31, 2013 represented 91.4% of our consolidated total tangible

<<<

 assets. As of March 31, 2013, after giving effect to the Issue, the Issuer's subsidiaries that are not guaranteeing the Notes would have had no oustanding long-term financial indebtedness. Any of the debt that our non-Guarantor subsidiaries

<<<

 incur in the future in accordance with the Indenture will rank structurally senior to the Notes and the Note Guarantees.
The Note Guarantees and security interests on the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and

<<<

 may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability.
The Indenture provides that certain Note Guarantees will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the relevant

<<<

 Guarantor without rendering the relevant Note Guarantee voidable or otherwise ineffective under applicable law and enforcement of each Note Guarantee would be subject to certain generally available defenses. These laws and defenses include

<<<

 those that relate to corporate benefit, fraudulent transfer or conveyance, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally

<<<

. Additionally, in accordance with local laws, the Security Agent may not be able to represent the holders of the Notes in a court process without a specific power of attorney.
36

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general

<<<

, under fraudulent conveyance and other laws, a court could subordinate or void the Note Guarantees or the security interests in the Collateral granted by the relevant Security Documents and, if payment had already been made under a Note Guarantee

<<<

 or upon enforcement of the Collateral, require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant Guarantor, if the court found that:
· the relevant Note Guarantee or security interest under the Security Documents was incurred with actual

<<<

 intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or security provider or, in certain jurisdictions, even when the recipient was simply aware that the Guarantor or security provider was insolvent when it granted

<<<

 the relevant Note Guarantee or security;
· the Guarantor or security provider did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for the relevant Note Guarantee or security interest under a Security Document and the Guarantor

<<<

 or security provider was: (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant Note Guarantee or security interest; (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant Note Guarantee or security interest; or (iii

<<<

) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity;
· the relevant Note Guarantees or Security Documents were held to exceed the corporate objective of the Guarantor or security provider

<<<

 or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor or security provider; or
· the amount paid or payable under the relevant Note Guarantee or the enforcement proceeds under the relevant Security Documents was in

<<<

 excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law.
The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon applicable governing law. Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time

<<<

 it incurred indebtedness:
· the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, is greater than the fair value of all its assets;
· the present fair salable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay the probable liability

<<<

 on its existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they become due; or
· it cannot pay its debts as they become due.
If a court were to find that the issuance of the Notes or a Note Guarantee was a fraudulent conveyance

<<<

 or held it unenforceable for any other reason, the court could hold that the payment obligations under the Notes or such Guarantee are ineffective, or require the holders of the Notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the Notes

<<<

 or such Note Guarantee. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent conveyance occurred, you may cease to have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and, if applicable, of the other Guarantors

<<<

 under any Note Guarantees that have not been declared void.
Additionally, any future pledge of Collateral in favor of the Security Agent, including pursuant to Security Documents delivered after the date of the Indenture, might be avoidable

<<<

 by the security provider (as debtor-in-possession) or by its trustee in bankruptcy (or similar officer) if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if the security provider is insolvent at the time of the pledge

<<<

, the pledge permits the holders of the Notes to receive a greater recovery than if the pledge had not been given and a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the security provider is commenced within three months following the pledge, or in certain

<<<

 circumstances, a longer period.
In order to receive the benefit of a security interest, the secured creditors must hold secured claims (i.e., the secured party and the creditor have to be the same person).
In addition, under the terms of the

<<<

 Indenture, we will be permitted in the future to incur additional indebtedness and other obligations that may share in the liens on the Collateral securing the Notes and the liens on the collateral securing our other secured debt. The granting

<<<

 of new security interests may require the releasing and retaking of security or otherwise create new hardening periods in certain jurisdictions. The applicable hardening period for these new security interests will run from the moment each

<<<

 new security interest has been granted or perfected. At each time, if the security interest granted or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void

<<<

 or ineffective and it may not be possible to enforce it.
Enforcing your rights as a holder of Notes or under the Note Guarantees or security across multiple jurisdictions may prove difficult.
The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of Sweden

<<<

 and the Guarantors are incorporated or organized under the laws of Sweden, Norway and Denmark. The Collateral includes the shares of certain of our subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of these jurisdictions. In the event of a bankruptcy

<<<

, insolvency or similar event, proceedings could be initiated in Sweden, Norway and Denmark. Such multijurisdictional proceedings are likely to be complex and costly for creditors and otherwise may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding

<<<

 the enforcement of your rights. Your rights under the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to the insolvency and administrative laws of several jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that you
37

will be able

<<<

 to effectively enforce your rights in such complex, multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings. The multijurisdictional nature of enforcement over the Collateral may limit the realizable value of the Collateral.
Moreover, in certain

<<<

 jurisdictions, it is unclear whether all security interests in the Collateral give the Security Agent a right to prevent other creditors from foreclosing on and realizing the Collateral or whether certain security interests only give the Security

<<<

 Agent priority in the distribution of any proceeds of such realization. Accordingly, the Security Agent and holders of the Notes may not be able to avoid foreclosure by other creditors (including unsecured creditors) on the Collateral.
Risks

<<<

 Related to Our Financial Profile
Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations may make it difficult for us to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and operate our business.
Upon the consummation of the Issue, we had a substantial

<<<

 amount of outstanding indebtedness with significant debt service requirements. On a Recalculation Basis after giving effect to the Issue, our total indebtedness (including the Notes) would have been SEK2,628 million (314 million) as of March

<<<

 31, 2013.
Our significant leverage could have important consequences for holders of the Notes, including, but not limited to:
· making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes and our other debt and liabilities

<<<

;
· requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our debt instead of operations, thus reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund internal growth through working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions

<<<

, joint ventures, product research and development, and other general corporate purposes;
· increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, a downturn in our business, or generally adverse economic or industry conditions

<<<

;
· placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged as us;
· limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the competitive environment and industry

<<<

;
· restricting us from pursuing strategic acquisitions or exploiting certain business opportunities;
· limiting, among other things, our and our subsidiaries' ability to borrow additional funds or raise equity capital in the future and increasing

<<<

 the costs of such additional financings;
· exposing us to risks that are inherent in interest rate fluctuations because certain of our indebtedness (including the Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes) bears variable rates of interest; and
· subjecting

<<<

 us to restrictive covenants, including, in the case of our Revolving Credit Facility, financial covenants, the non-compliance with which could result in an event of default under, or acceleration of, our indebtedness.
We primarily expect to

<<<

 use cash flow from operations and borrowings under our new Revolving Credit Facility to finance our operations, service our indebtedness and fund capital expenditures. Our ability to make these payments depends on our future performance, which

<<<

 will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors, many of which we cannot control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, which could result in us being unable to service

<<<

 or repay indebtedness or fund other liquidity needs. If we cannot service our indebtedness and meet our other obligations and commitments, we might be required to refinance our debt or dispose of assets to obtain funds for such purpose. We

<<<

 cannot assure you that such refinancings or asset disposals could be effected on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all, or would be permitted by the terms of our debt instruments.
Despite our high level of indebtedness and restrictive

<<<

 covenants, we and our subsidiaries are still able to incur significant additional amounts of debt or make certain restricted payments, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage.
We and our subsidiaries

<<<

 may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness, including additional secured indebtedness, in the future. Although the Indenture and the agreement governing our new Revolving Credit Facility contain restrictions on the incurrence

<<<

 of additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and, under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness (including secured indebtedness) that could be incurred in compliance with

<<<

 these restrictions could be substantial. Following the Issue, we have SEK550 million immediately available for borrowing under our new Revolving Credit Facility. Under the Indenture, in addition to specified permitted debt, we are able to incur

<<<

 additional indebtedness so long as on a pro forma basis our fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Indenture) is at least 2.0 to 1.0 and additional indebtedness sharing in the Collateral securing the Notes so long as on a pro forma

<<<

 basis our consolidated senior secured leverage ratio (as defined in the Indenture) is no greater than 5.0 to 1.0. In addition, neither the Indenture nor the agreement governing our new Revolving Credit Facility prevents us from incurring obligations

<<<

 that do not
38

constitute indebtedness under those agreements. Moreover, some of the debt we may incur in the future could be effectively and structurally senior to the Notes and may be secured by collateral that does not secure the Notes

<<<

. The incurrence of additional debt would increase the leverage-related risks described in this Prospectus. If we are able to designate some of our restricted subsidiaries under the Indenture as unrestricted subsidiaries, those unrestricted

<<<

 subsidiaries would be permitted to borrow beyond the limitations specified in the Indenture and engage in other activities in which restricted subsidiaries may not engage. We are also permitted to invest in joint ventures and acquisitions,

<<<

 which may increase our indebtedness. Moreover, although the Indenture and the agreement governing our new Revolving Credit Facility contain restrictions on our ability to make restricted payments, including the declaration and payment of dividends

<<<

, we are able to make substantial restricted payments under certain circumstances. Under the Indenture, for example, we are able to make dividends, distributions, loans or other payments to any Parent (as defined therein) within 18 months of

<<<

 the Issue Date in an aggregate amount not to exceed SEK500 million so long as on a pro forma basis our consolidated senior secured leverage ratio does not exceed 4.5 to 1.0 on a net basis. Adding new debt to our and our subsidiaries' existing

<<<

 debt levels or making restricted payments could exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage described above, including our possible inability to service our debt.
We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our

<<<

 indebtedness, including due to factors outside our control, and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.
Our ability to service our indebtedness will depend on our

<<<

 future performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors. Some of these factors are beyond our control. In addition, our ability to borrow funds in the future to make

<<<

 payments on our debt will depend on the satisfaction of the covenants in our debt agreements, including the Indenture, and other agreements we may enter into in the future. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash

<<<

 flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make interest and principal payments on our debt, including the Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs.
If our cash flows from

<<<

 operations and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital, forego opportunities, or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness

<<<

, including the Notes. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not be sufficient to enable us to meet our scheduled debt obligations. In the absence of such cash flows and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems

<<<

 and could be required to sell material assets to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those asset sales to raise capital or sell assets at prices and on terms that we believe are fair, and

<<<

 any proceeds that we receive may not be adequate to meet any debt obligations then due. If we cannot meet our debt obligations, the holders of our debt may accelerate our debt and, to the extent such debt is secured, foreclose on our assets

<<<

 securing such debt. In such an event, we may not have sufficient assets to repay all of our debt.
In addition, any failure to make payments of interest or principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a

<<<

 reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. For a discussion of our cash flows and liquidity, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Results

<<<

 of Operations--Liquidity and Capital Resources".
We are subject to restrictive debt covenants limit our flexibility in operating our business and our ability to raise additional funds.
The Indenture and the agreement governing our new Revolving

<<<

 Credit Facility contain covenants that significantly restrict our ability to:
· incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock;
· incur or permit to exist certain liens;
· make certain payments, including dividends

<<<

 or other distributions, with respect to capital stock;
· prepay or redeem subordinated debt or capital stock;
· make certain loans or other investments;
· create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions

<<<

, loans or advances to, and on the transfer of assets to the Issuer or any of its restricted subsidiaries;
· sell, lease or transfer certain assets, including capital stock of restricted subsidiaries;
· engage in certain transactions with affiliates

<<<

;
· issue or sell the share capital of certain subsidiaries;
· consummate a change of control;
· consolidate or merge with other entities or sell substantially all of our assets; and
39

· impair the security interests for the benefit of the

<<<

 holders of the Notes.
Each of the covenants is subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications. See "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements--Revolving Credit Facility" and "Description of the Senior Secured Notes--Certain

<<<

 Covenants." Despite these exceptions and qualifications, the covenants contained in the Indenture and the agreement governing our new Revolving Credit Facility could materially affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability

<<<

 to react to market conditions, raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns, take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise or grow in accordance with our strategy. For

<<<

 example, such restrictions could adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, make strategic acquisitions, investments or alliances, restructure our organization or finance our capital needs.
Additionally, our Revolving Credit Facility

<<<

 Agreement requires us to maintain a super senior leverage ratio, which must not exceed 2.5 to 1.0, tested quarterly, and our ability to meet that financial ratio can be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial

<<<

 and industry conditions. A breach of any of those covenants or restrictions could result in an event of default under the agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, and the relevant lenders, subject to applicable cure periods and other

<<<

 limitations on acceleration or enforcement, could cancel the availability of the Revolving Credit Facility and elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable. In addition, a

<<<

 default under the agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility could lead to an event of default and acceleration under other debt instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions, including the Indenture. If our

<<<

 creditors, including the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, accelerate the payment of those amounts, we cannot assure you that our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay in full those amounts, and to

<<<

 satisfy all other liabilities of our subsidiaries which would be due and payable and to make payments to enable us to repay the Notes, in full or in part. In addition, if we are unable to repay those amounts, our creditors could proceed against

<<<

 any collateral granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts.
The Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes and revolving commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a floating rate that could rise significantly, increasing

<<<

 our interest cost and debt and reducing our cash flow.
The Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes and Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a floating rate. These interest rates could rise significantly in the future, increasing our interest

<<<

 expense. Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, we are not required to do so and there can be no assurance that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable

<<<

 terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. To the extent interest rates were to rise significantly our interest expense associated

<<<

 with the Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes and any drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility would correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow.
Risks Related to the Notes
Creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, any credit facility

<<<

 that refinances or replaces the Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations are entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of the Collateral sold in any enforcement sale in priority to the Notes. Holders of the Notes will not control

<<<

 decisions regarding the Collateral in certain circumstances.
The Notes and the Note Guarantees are secured initially on a first-ranking basis by the same Collateral securing the obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging

<<<

 liabilities. In addition, under the terms of the Indenture, we are permitted to incur significant additional indebtedness and other obligations that may be secured by the same Collateral on a pari passu or on a super-priority basis, including

<<<

 other future credit facilities and certain hedging liabilities.
Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain future credit facilities (subject to the incurrence of additional indebtedness permitted

<<<

 by the Indenture) and certain hedging liabilities are entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of the Collateral sold in any enforcement sale in priority to the Notes. As such, in the event of a foreclosure on the Collateral, you may not be

<<<

 able to recover amounts owed to you if the then outstanding claims under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain future credit facilities and such hedging obligations are greater than the proceeds realized. Any proceeds from an enforcement sale

<<<

 of the Collateral by any creditor will, after all obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, future credit facilities benefitting from such ranking and such hedging obligations have been discharged from such recoveries, be applied pro

<<<

 rata in repayment of the Notes and any other obligations secured by the Collateral which are permitted to rank pari passu with the Notes.
The lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain future credit facilities and creditors in respect

<<<

 of certain hedging obligations may have interests that are different from the interests of holders of the Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue their remedies under the Security Documents at

<<<

 a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so.
In addition, if the Security Agent sells Collateral comprising the shares of any of our subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the

<<<

 Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Note Guarantees and the liens over any assets of such entities securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees may be released. See "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements--Intercreditor Agreement

<<<

" and "Description of the Senior Secured Notes--Security--Release of Liens."
40

The rights of holders of the Notes to enforce remedies with respect to the Collateral are subject to collateral sharing arrangements.
The security interest in

<<<

 our assets serving as Collateral for the Notes and the Note Guarantees thereof are also granted as collateral in favor of the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging counterparties. The Intercreditor Agreement and the

<<<

 Indenture also permit a security interest in such Collateral to be granted to lenders of additional debt and to hedging counterparties under certain of our hedging obligations. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that a common Security Agent

<<<

, who will also serve as the Security Agent for the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedge counterparties and any additional secured debt, acts only as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement. In general, the lenders

<<<

 and the agent under the Revolving Credit Facility and the representatives of our hedging counterparties and any agent with respect to any future secured debt will have, subject to prior notification of and consultation with the Trustee, the

<<<

 right to instruct the Security Agent to enforce the shared collateral. In addition, holders of the Notes will not be able to force a sale of the Collateral or otherwise independently pursue the remedies of a secured creditor under the Security

<<<

 Documents without consulting the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedge counterparties and any such other secured debt for so long as any amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations or such other

<<<

 secured debt remain outstanding or as specified in the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the enforcement sale of any Collateral will be subject to, as a condition to the release of any claims of any other debt

<<<

 secured by such Collateral under the Intercreditor Agreement, certain protections intended to maximize the secured creditors' recovery from an enforcement sale. Prior to enforcement of the Collateral by another class of creditors, the Trustee

<<<

 will be provided with notice and the right to consult. Neither the Trustee, the Issuer nor the holders of the Notes will have the ability to prevent or delay enforcement after the relevant consultation periods have expired.
The Intercreditor

<<<

 Agreement further provides that in the event that the classes of creditors entitled to provide enforcement instructions to the Security Agent provide conflicting instructions, such creditors must, subject to certain exceptions, consult with

<<<

 each other for a period of not less than 30 days following the earlier of (i) the date of such conflicting instructions and (ii) the date falling ten business days after the first enforcement instructions were delivered in accordance with the

<<<

 provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, before any enforcement action may be taken. Although enforcement instructions given by the holders of the Notes will prevail after such consultation period (other than in the case that an insolvency

<<<

 event has occurred), if the liabilities under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations have not been fully discharged within six months of the date the first such enforcement instruction was issued or if no steps have been

<<<

 taken in relation to the commencement of enforcement of the Collateral from the date that is three months after the date of such enforcement instruction (including any instruction not to take enforcement steps) then enforcement instructions

<<<

 by the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and creditors under certain hedging liabilities will prevail. These arrangements could be disadvantageous to the holders of the Notes in a number of respects and may permit the lenders under

<<<

 the Revolving Credit Facility and creditors under certain hedging liabilities to control enforcement in circumstances in which their interests are different from those of the holders of the Notes. See "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements

<<<

--Intercreditor Agreement." The lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedge counterparties or any other future class of debt secured by the Collateral may have interests that are different from the interests of holders of the

<<<

 Notes and they may elect to pursue their remedies under the Security Documents at a time when it would not be advantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so.
The rights of the holders of the Notes to take enforcement action, including with

<<<

 respect to the liens securing the Notes, are limited.
The Intercreditor Agreement provides that a common security agent, who will also serve as the security agent for the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, our hedging obligations

<<<

 and any additional debt secured by the Collateral permitted to be incurred by the Indenture, will act only as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement regulates the ability of the trustee or holders of the Notes

<<<

 to instruct the security agent to take enforcement action. The security agent will not be required to take enforcement action unless instructed to do so by an instructing group that comprises (i) creditors holding more than 66 2/3% of the indebtedness

<<<

 and commitments under any "super priority" credit facility, including the Revolving Credit Facility and the priority hedging obligations when entered into (the "Majority Super Senior Creditors") or (ii) the holders of the required principal

<<<

 amount of the then outstanding Notes as set out in the Indenture (or if the required amount is not specified, the holders holding at least the majority of the principal amount of the then outstanding Notes), the non-priority hedging obligations

<<<

 when entered into and the holders of the required principal amount of the then outstanding indebtedness ranking pari passu with the Notes as set out in the relevant documents governing such debt ranking pari passu with the Notes (or if the

<<<

 required amount is not specified, the holders holding at least the majority of the principal amount of the then outstanding amount of such indebtedness) whose principal amount outstanding under the Notes and such indebtedness ranking pari passu

<<<

 with the Notes (the "Senior Secured Credit Participations") at that time aggregate more than 50% of the total Senior Secured Credit Participations at that time (the "Majority Senior Secured Creditors") (in each case acting through their respective

<<<

 creditor representative). If, however, before the super-senior discharge date, the security agent has received conflicting enforcement instructions from the creditor representatives then, to the extent the instructions from the Majority Senior

<<<

 Secured Creditors comply with the initial consultation requirements and the security enforcement principles, the security agent will comply with the instructions from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, provided that if the super-senior

<<<

 liabilities have not been fully discharged within six months of the date on which the first such enforcement instructions were issued, or no enforcement has occurred within three months of the date on which the first such enforcement instructions

<<<

 were first issued, then the instructions of the Majority Super Senior Creditors will prevail. If, prior to the later of the super senior discharge date and the senior secured discharge date the Senior Secured Instructing Group has instructed

<<<

 the security agent not to enforce or to cease enforcing the Transaction Security or the Senior Secured Instructing Group has not issued instructions, and the Senior Secured Instructing Group has not required any Debtor to
41

make a Distressed

<<<

 Disposal, the Security Agent shall give effect to any instructions to enforce the Transaction Security which the Second Lien Notes Trustee or the Additional Second Lien Debt Representative (acting on the instructions of the Second Lien Notes

<<<

/Additional Second Lien Required Holders) are then entitled to give to the Security Agent under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. To the extent we incur additional indebtedness that is secured on a pari passu basis with the Notes, your

<<<

 voting interest in an instructing group comprised of Senior Secured Creditors will be diluted commensurate with the amount of indebtedness we incur.
Our failure to comply with the covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement or the

<<<

 Indenture, including as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the

<<<

 Indenture require us to comply with various covenants, including financial covenants in the Revolving Credit Facility requiring us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy specified financial tests.
The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement

<<<

 requires us to maintain a leverage ratios and a minimum cash balance. See "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements--Revolving Credit Facility." Our ability to meet these financial ratios and tests could be affected by a deterioration

<<<

 in our results of operations, as well as by events beyond our control, including decreases in tariffs and unfavorable economic conditions, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet those ratios and tests. Moreover, the Revolving

<<<

 Credit Facility Agreement includes certain events of default (such as breach of representations and warranties and cross-payment defaults) that are in addition to the events of default set forth in the Indenture. If an event of default occurs

<<<

 under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement or any other of our debt instruments and is not cured or waived, the holders of the defaulted debt could terminate their commitments and declare all amounts borrowed, together with accrued and unpaid

<<<

 interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. Borrowings under other debt instruments, including the Notes, that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions also may be accelerated or become payable on demand. In these

<<<

 circumstances, our assets and cash flows may not be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness and our other indebtedness, including the Notes then outstanding, which could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation, and we might not be able

<<<

 to repay our obligations under the Notes in such an event.
The value of the Collateral securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Notes, and there may be limitations on your ability

<<<

 to foreclose on the Collateral.
The Notes and the Note Guarantees are secured by security interests in the Collateral described in this Prospectus, which Collateral also secures the obligations under any "super priority" credit facility, including

<<<

 the Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations. The Revolving Credit Facility contains a mechanism under which commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility may be increased from SEK550 million to up to SEK910 million and any

<<<

 such increase will also benefit from firstranking security interests in the Collateral. Upon a refinancing of the Revolving Credit Facility, or if the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility consent to an increase under the Revolving Credit

<<<

 Facility, the amount that will benefit from firstranking security interest in the Collateral may be increased up to the amount provided under the Indenture. The Collateral may also secure additional debt ranking pari passu with the Notes to

<<<

 the extent permitted by the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. Your rights to the Collateral may therefore be diluted by any increase in the first-priority debt secured by the Collateral.
The Collateral securing the Notes

<<<

 are subject to any and all exceptions, defects, imperfections, encumbrances and other liens permitted under the Indenture. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, imperfections, encumbrances and other liens could adversely affect the

<<<

 value of the Collateral securing the Notes as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on that Collateral. Furthermore, the first-priority ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including

<<<

, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or recharacterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions. The security interests of the security agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated

<<<

 with the realization of security interests in Collateral. For example, the Security Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any

<<<

 such consents. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets

<<<

 and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease.
The value of the Collateral and the amount to be received upon a sale of such Collateral will depend upon many factors, including, among others, the ability to sell the Collateral

<<<

 in an orderly sale, the condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability of buyers. The book value of the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. All or a portion of

<<<

 the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Likewise, we cannot assure you that there will be a market for the sale of the Collateral, or, if such a market exists, that there will not be a substantial

<<<

 delay in its liquidation. In addition, the share pledges of an entity may be of no value if that entity is subject to an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding. Consequently, liquidating the Collateral may not result in proceeds in an amount sufficient

<<<

 to pay any amounts due under the Notes after satisfying the obligations to pay any creditors with prior liens. If the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, holders of the Notes (to

<<<

 the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only an unsecured, unsubordinated claim against the Issuer's and the Guarantors' remaining assets, which may not be sufficient to repay our obligations under

<<<

 the Notes.
42

Your rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the Collateral.
Under applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can be properly perfected

<<<

, and its priority retained, only through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor of the security. The liens in the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we fail

<<<

 or are unable to take the actions we are required to take to perfect or maintain the perfection of any of these liens. In addition, applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest

<<<

, such as real property, equipment subject to a certificate and certain proceeds, can only be perfected at or promptly following the time such property and rights are acquired and identified.
The Trustee and the Security Agent for the Notes

<<<

 are under no obligation to monitor, and we may not comply with our obligations to inform the Trustee or Security Agent of, any future acquisition of property and rights by us, and the necessary action may not be taken to properly perfect the

<<<

 security interest in such after-acquired property or rights. Such failure may result in the invalidity of the security interest in the Collateral or adversely affect the priority of the security interest in favor of the Notes against third

<<<

 parties. Neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent for the Notes has any obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights by us or the perfection of any security interest.
It is uncertain under Danish law whether obligations

<<<

 owing to beneficial owners of the Notes that are not identified as registered holders of security rights in shares issued by the Danish subsidiaries of the Issuer will be validly secured. If any challenge to the validity of those security interests

<<<

 were successful, the holders of the Notes may not be able to recover any amounts under the share pledges granted over subsidiaries incorporated in Denmark.
The security over the Collateral will not be granted directly to the holders of the

<<<

 Notes, and the holders of the Notes will have limited rights to enforce remedies under the Security Documents.
The security interests in the Collateral that secure our obligations under the Notes and the obligations of the Guarantors under

<<<

 the Note Guarantees are not granted directly to the holders of the Notes, but will be granted only in favor of the Security Agent. The Trustee has entered into the Intercreditor Agreement with, among others, the Security Agent and representatives

<<<

 of the other indebtedness secured by the Collateral, including our new Revolving Credit Facility. Other creditors may become parties to the Intercreditor Agreement in the future. Among other things, the Intercreditor Agreement governs the enforcement

<<<

 of the Security Documents, the sharing in any recoveries from such enforcement and the release of the Collateral by the Security Agent. As a consequence, holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled

<<<

 to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Security Agent, who will follow instructions as set forth under "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements--Intercreditor Agreement."
While Danish

<<<

 courts will recognize a duly appointed agent's right to enforce security interests in court on behalf of named secured creditors, there is a risk that the Security Agent's right to enforce security interests in its own name on behalf of secured

<<<

 creditors from time to time may be successfully contested.
The Issuer and the Guarantors have control over the Collateral securing the Notes, and the operation of the business or sale of particular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing

<<<

 the Notes.
The Security Documents allow the Issuer and the Guarantors to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income from the Collateral securing the Notes. So long as

<<<

 no default or event of default under the Indenture would result therefrom, the Issuer and the Guarantors may, among other things, subject to certain limitations with respect to Security Documents governed by Swedish law, Norwegian law or Danish

<<<

 law, without any release or consent by the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the Collateral, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of Collateral and making ordinary course cash payments

<<<

, including repayments of indebtedness. Any of these activities could reduce the value of the Collateral, which could reduce the amounts payable to you from the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral in the case of an enforcement of the liens

<<<

 on the Notes. To the extent that additional indebtedness and obligations are secured by the Collateral, our control over the Collateral may be diminished. To the extent these activities are allowed with regard to certain security interests

<<<

, under Swedish law and Danish law, such security interests could be considered not validly perfected.
The granting of the security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes, or the incurrence of permitted debt in the future, may

<<<

 create or restart hardening periods, i.e., the periods of time following the granting of security interests during which such security interests may be challenged in accordance with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions.
The granting

<<<

 of security interests to secure the Notes and the Note Guarantees may create hardening periods for such security interests in certain jurisdictions. The granting of shared security interests to secure future indebtedness permitted to be secured

<<<

 on the Collateral may restart or reopen such hardening periods in particular, because the Indenture permits the release and retaking of security granted in favor of the Notes in certain circumstances, including in connection with the incurrence

<<<

 of future indebtedness. The applicable hardening period for these new security interests can run from the moment each new security interest has been granted or perfected. At each time, if the security interest granted or recreated were to be

<<<

 enforced before the end of the respective hardening period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective and/or it may not be possible to enforce it.
43

The same considerations also apply following the issuance of

<<<

 the Notes in connection with the accession of further subsidiaries as additional Guarantors and the granting of security interest over their relevant assets and equity interests for the benefit of holders of the Notes.
There are circumstances

<<<

 other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be released automatically and under which the Note Guarantees will be released automatically, without your consent or

<<<

 the consent of the relevant Trustee.
Under various circumstances, the Collateral securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be released automatically, including:
· upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on

<<<

 the Notes;
· upon release of the Note Guarantee (with respect to the liens securing such Note Guarantee granted by such Guarantor);
· in connection with a disposition of Collateral to any person other than the Issuer or any of its restricted

<<<

 subsidiaries if the sale or other disposition does not violate the requirements of the provisions set forth under "Description of the Senior Secured Notes--Certain Covenants--Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock" or is otherwise

<<<

 permitted in accordance with the Indenture;
· if the Issuer designates any Guarantor to be an unrestricted subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and capital stock,

<<<

 of such unrestricted subsidiary;
· in connection with certain enforcement actions taken by the creditors pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement; and
· in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture.
Even though holders of the Notes share

<<<

 in the Collateral securing the Notes ratably with the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, under certain circumstances, the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and certain of our hedging arrangements will control enforcement

<<<

 actions with respect to the Collateral through the Security Agent, whether or not holders of the Notes agree or disagree with those actions. See "Description of the Senior Secured Notes--Security-- Enforcement of Security Interest."
Under various

<<<

 circumstances, the Note Guarantees will be released automatically, including:
· upon a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of that Guarantor (including by way of merger or consolidation) or the share capital

<<<

 of that Guarantor to a person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Issuer or a restricted subsidiary of the Issuer, if the sale or other disposition is otherwise permitted by the provisions set forth under

<<<

 "Description of the Senior Secured Notes--Certain Covenants-- Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock";
· if the Issuer designates any restricted subsidiary that is a Guarantor to be an unrestricted subsidiary in accordance with

<<<

 the applicable provisions of the Indenture;
· upon the defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as provided under "Description of the Senior Secured Notes--Defeasance" or "Description of the Senior Secured Notes--Satisfaction

<<<

 and Discharge," as applicable;
· pursuant to a transaction permitted by the covenant described under "Description of the Senior Secured Notes-- Certain Covenants--Merger and Consolidation";
· with respect to a Guarantor that is an Immaterial

<<<

 Subsidiary (as defined under "Description of the Senior Secured Notes--Certain Definitions"), so long as no event of default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture, to the extent that such Guarantor is unconditionally released and

<<<

 discharged from all liabilities as a guarantor, if any, with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility and any other indebtedness; and
· in accordance with the other provisions of the Indenture.
In addition, the Note Guarantees and security

<<<

 interests will be subject to release as contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement. Unless consented to, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent shall not, in an enforcement scenario, exercise its rights to release

<<<

 the Note Guarantees or security interests in the Collateral securing the Notes unless the relevant sale or disposal is made:
· for consideration, all or substantially all of which is in the form of cash;
44

· concurrently with the unconditional

<<<

 discharge or release of the indebtedness of the disposed entities to certain other creditors, including the creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility; and
· pursuant to a competitive process, or (if not by way of public auction) following

<<<

 the issuance of a fairness opinion with respect to the amount received in connection with such sale from an independent investment bank or internationally recognized accounting firm selected by the Security Agent.
See "Description of Certain

<<<

 Financing Arrangements--Intercreditor Agreement."
The Collateral is subject to casualty risks.
We intend to maintain insurance or otherwise insure against hazards in a manner appropriate and customary for our business. There are, however, certain

<<<

 losses that may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable, in whole or in part. Insurance proceeds may not compensate us fully for our losses. If there is a complete or partial loss of any of the Collateral, the insurance proceeds

<<<

 may not be sufficient to satisfy all of the secured obligations, including the Notes and the Note Guarantees.
In the event of a total or partial loss to any of our facilities, certain items of equipment and inventory may not be easily replaced

<<<

, if at all. Accordingly, even though there may be insurance coverage, the extended period needed to manufacture replacement units or inventory could cause significant delays and any such delay could further decrease the value of the other Collateral

<<<

.
We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control as required by the Indenture.
Upon the occurrence of certain events

<<<

 constituting a "change of control" as defined in the Indenture, the Issuer is required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof on the date of purchase plus accrued

<<<

 and unpaid interest to the date of purchase. If a change of control were to occur, our ability to make such purchase may be limited by our then existing financial resources and we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available

<<<

 at such time to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in the Revolving Credit Facility, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or our other then existing contractual obligations would allow us to make

<<<

 such required repurchases. A change of control may result in an event of default under, or acceleration of, the Revolving Credit Facility and other indebtedness. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under

<<<

 such indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from its subsidiaries to allow them to pay cash to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a change of control may be limited

<<<

 by our then existing financial resources. In addition, under the terms of the agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility, under certain circumstances, if we repay more than 60% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes offered hereby

<<<

, we are required to repay and cancel commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility in the same proportion until the total commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility are reduced to SEK250 million (or its equivalent in other currencies

<<<

). Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting a change of control occurs at a time when we are prohibited from providing funds to any of the Issuer for the purpose of repurchasing

<<<

 the Notes, we may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such a consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the

<<<

 Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we expect that we would require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. We cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain

<<<

 such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility and certain other

<<<

 indebtedness. See "Description of the Senior Secured Notes--Change of Control."
The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including

<<<

 a reorganization, restructuring, merger or other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute

<<<

 a "change of control" as defined in the Indenture. Except as described under "Description of the Senior Secured Notes--Change of Control," the Indenture will not contain provisions that would require the Issuer to offer to repurchase or redeem

<<<

 the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction.
The definition of "change of control" contained in the Indenture will include (with certain exceptions) a disposition of all or substantially

<<<

 all the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase "all or substantially all," there is no precisely established definition of

<<<

 the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of "all or substantially all" of the Issuer's assets and its restricted

<<<

 subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.
Furthermore, the occurrence of certain events that might

<<<

 otherwise constitute a change of control under the Indenture will not be deemed to be a change of control if at the time our consolidated leverage ratio is less than certain specified levels. See "Description of the Senior Secured Notes--Certain

<<<

 Definitions--Specified Change of Control Event."
45

Certain covenants may fall away upon the occurrence of a change in our ratings.
The Indenture provides that, if at any time following the date of the Indenture, the Notes receive a rating

<<<

 of Baa3 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and a rating of BBB­ or better from Standard & Poor's Investors Ratings Services and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing, then beginning that day and continuing

<<<

 until such time as the Notes cease to have investment-grade ratings from both Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor's Investors Ratings Services, certain covenants will cease to be applicable to the Notes. See "Description of the

<<<

 Senior Secured Notes--Certain Covenants--Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status."
If these covenants were to be suspended, we would be able to incur additional indebtedness or make payments, including dividends or

<<<

 investments, which may conflict with the interests of holders of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve an investment-grade rating or that any such rating will be maintained.
There is no established trading market

<<<

 for the Notes. If a market for the Notes does not develop, your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.
The Notes are new issues of securities for which there is currently no established trading market. Accordingly, we cannot assure you as

<<<

 to:
· the liquidity of any market in the Notes;
· your ability to sell your Notes; or
· the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.
Although the Issuer intends to use commercially reasonable efforts to list the SEK Senior Secured

<<<

 Floating Rate Notes on NASDAQ OMX Stockholm, there can be no assurance that such application will be accepted for listing or that the SEK Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes will be so admitted. The Initial Purchasers of the Notes have advised

<<<

 us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any market-making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion

<<<

 of the Initial Purchasers without notice.
The liquidity of the trading market in the Notes and the market price quoted for the Notes may be adversely affected by many factors, including, among other things, changes in the overall market for

<<<

 similar securities, interest rates, our financial performance or prospects or in the prospects for companies in our industry generally. Historically, the market for non-investmentgrade debt has been subject to substantial volatility, which

<<<

 could adversely affect the price at which you may sell your Notes. In addition, subsequent to their initial issue, the Notes may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for

<<<

 similar notes, our operating performance and other factors. As a result, an active trading market for the Notes may not develop or, if developed, may not continue, and you may be unable to sell your Notes.
Furthermore, it is possible that the

<<<

 market for the Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of the Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance. As a result, there is no assurance that there will

<<<

 be an active trading market for the Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your holding of the Notes at a fair value, if at all. In addition, the Indenture will allow the Issuer to issue additional Notes

<<<

 in the future which could adversely impact the liquidity of the Notes offered hereby.
The Notes are initially held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely on the procedures of the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and

<<<

 remedies.
The Notes are initially only issued in global form and held by, or on behalf of, a common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.
Interests in the global notes trade in book-entry form only, and the Notes in definitive

<<<

 registered form ("definitive registered notes"), will be issued in exchange for book-entry interests only in very limited circumstances. Owners of book-entry interests are not considered owners of the Notes. The common depositary, or its nominee

<<<

, for Euroclear and Clearstream is the sole registered holder of the global notes representing the Notes. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the global notes representing the Notes are made to Deutsche

<<<

 Bank AG, London Branch, as principal Paying Agent, which makes payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, these payments are credited to participants' accounts that hold book-entry interests in the global notes representing the Notes

<<<

 and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, we have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of

<<<

 book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest, you must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and if you are not a participant in Euroclear or Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant through which

<<<

 you own your interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the Notes under the Indenture.
Unlike the registered holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests do not have the direct right to act upon our solicitations

<<<

 for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes. Instead, if you own a bookentry interest, you are permitted to act only to the extent you have received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear or
46

Clearstream

<<<

. The procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies may not be sufficient to enable you to vote on a timely basis.
Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until definitive registered Notes

<<<

 are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if you own a book-entry interest, you are restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures to be implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream may not be adequate to ensure

<<<

 the timely exercise of rights under the Notes. See "Book-Entry, Delivery and Form." The transfer of the Notes is restricted, which may affect the value of the Notes.
The Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been registered under the U.S.

<<<

 Securities Act or the securities laws of any jurisdiction and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act

<<<

 and any other applicable laws. We have not undertaken any registration rights in respect of the Notes. It is your obligation to ensure that your offers and sales of Notes comply with applicable law. Credit ratings may not reflect all risks

<<<

, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time.
One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The ratings may not reflect the

<<<

 potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed above and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may

<<<

 be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely

<<<

 by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely

<<<

 affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely affect the value and trading of the Notes. Risks Related to Our Ownership The interests of our principal shareholders may conflict with your interests as a holder

<<<

 of the Notes.
The interests of our controlling shareholders may conflict with yours as a holder of the Notes, particularly if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when due. The controlling shareholders have (directly

<<<

 or indirectly) the power to, among other things, affect our legal and capital structure and our day-to-day operations and may have an incentive to increase the value of their investments or cause us to distribute funds at the expense of our

<<<

 financial condition, which could impact our ability to make payments on the Notes. In addition, the controlling shareholders have the power to elect a majority of our board of directors and appoint new officers and management and, therefore

<<<

, effectively control many other major decisions regarding our operations. We cannot assure you that the interests of the controlling shareholders will not conflict with your interests as a holder of the Notes. See "Principal Shareholder" and

<<<

 "Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions."

PRESENTATION OF INFORMATION
IFRS Financial Information
The Issuer, Bravida Holding AB (publ), was incorporated on April 10, 2012 in connection with the Acquisition Transactions (as

<<<

 defined herein). No financial statements of the Issuer are available prior to the date of its incorporation. Accordingly, as of and for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012 and the three months ended March 31, 2012, this Prospectus

<<<

 presents the historical financial information for Bravida AB, the Issuer's predecessor, and its consolidated subsidiaries. This Prospectus presents the historical financial information of the Issuer and its consolidated subsidiaries as of and

<<<

 for the three months ended March 31, 2013. In addition thereto, the Issuer's audited financial statements as of and for the period April 25, 2012 ­ December 31, 2012, prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in Sweden

<<<

 as in effect from time to time ("Swedish GAAP") and the Issuer's unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements as of and for the nine months ended 30 September 2013 prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standards

<<<

 34, Interim Financial Reporting ("IAS 34") are incorporated into this Prospectus through reference, due to requirements stipulated by the SFSA pursuant to the Trading Act but are not presented below in conjunction with "Selected Historical

<<<

 Consolidated Financial and Other Information," "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" or elsewhere in this Prospectus.
We refer to the periods for which financial information is presented for

<<<

 Bravida AB and its consolidated subsidiaries in this Prospectus as the "Predecessor periods" and the periods for which historical financial information is presented for the Issuer and its consolidated subsidiaries as the "Successor periods

<<<

." Due to the accounting impact of the Acquisition Transactions and other factors, such as increased interest expense resulting from the Acquisition Transactions, financial information in respect of the Successor periods is not directly comparable

<<<

 to that in respect of the Predecessor periods. See "--Impact of the Acquisition Transactions on Our Historical Financial Information."
In order to provide a meaningful comparison of our results for the Successor periods to those for the Predecessor

<<<

 periods, we also present in this Prospectus unaudited recalculated condensed consolidated financial information for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and for the year ended December 31, 2012. The unaudited recalculated condensed consolidated

<<<

 financial information represents the historical audited financial information for the Predecessor, as adjusted to give recalculation effect to historical income and expenses recorded by Bravida AB's intermediate holding companies (Bravida Installation

<<<

 och Service AB (formerly Bravissima Acquisition AB), Scandinavian Installation Refi AB and Scandinavian Installation Acquisition AB (collectively, the "Intermediate Holding Companies")), and by Bravissima AS and the Issuer, as well as the Acquisition

<<<

 Transactions, as if such transactions had occurred on January 1, 2012. The recalculation adjustments are based on available information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable. The unaudited recalculated condensed consolidated

<<<

 financial information should be read in conjunction with "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and the historical financial statements which are incorporated through reference into this Prospectus

<<<

. The unaudited recalculated condensed consolidated financial information is presented for information purposes only and is not intended to represent or be indicative of the results of operations or financial condition that we would have reported

<<<

 had the Acquisition Transactions actually occurred on January 1, 2012, and they do not purport to project our results of operations or financial condition for any future period. In addition, the unaudited recalculated condensed consolidated

<<<

 financial information presented in this Prospectus has not been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union ("IFRS"), and neither the recalculation adjustments to the historical financial

<<<

 information nor the resulting unaudited recalculated condensed consolidated financial information has been audited or reviewed in accordance with applicable auditing standards. Due to the accounting impact of the Acquisition Transactions, particularly

<<<

 the adjustments related to acquisition accounting, and other factors, such as the increased interest expense resulting from the Acquisition Transactions, the unaudited recalculated condensed consolidated financial information is not directly

<<<

 comparable to the Predecessor's historical financial information presented in this Prospectus. Although we present a comparison of the Successor's unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the three months ended March

<<<

 31, 2013 to the Successor's unaudited recalculated condensed consolidated financial information for the three months ended March 31, 2012, these results are not directly comparable. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

<<<

 and Results of Operations."
The following financial statements and financial information are included in this Prospectus, either directly or incorporated through reference:
· audited consolidated financial statements of Bravida AB and its consolidated

<<<

 subsidiaries as of and for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, prepared in accordance with IFRS;
· unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of Bravida AB and its consolidated subsidiaries as of and for the

<<<

 three months ended March 31, 2012, prepared in accordance with IAS 34);
· audited financial statements of the Issuer as of and for the period April 25, 2012 ­ December 31, 2012, prepared in accordance with Swedish GAAP;
· unaudited condensed

<<<

 consolidated interim financial statements of the Issuer and its consolidated subsidiaries as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2013, prepared in accordance with IAS 34;
48

· unaudited recalculated condensed consolidated financial

<<<

 information for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and for the year ended December 31, 2012;
· unaudited recalculated condensed consolidated financial information for the twelve months ended March 31, 2013; and
· unaudited condensed consolidated

<<<

 interim financial statements of the Issuer and its consolidated subsidiaries as of and for the nine months ended 30 September 2013, prepared in accordance with IAS 34.
The historical audited financial information included in this Prospectus

<<<

, including the audited financial information discussed in "Summary--Summary Consolidated Historical and Recalculated Financial and Other Information," "Selected Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Information" and "Management's Discussion

<<<

 and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," for each of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012 has been derived or extracted from Bravida AB's audited consolidated financial statements which have been audited

<<<

 by Bravida AB's independent auditors, KPMG AB. The historical unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Prospectus for the three months ended March 31, 2012 have been derived or extracted from Bravida AB's unaudited

<<<

 interim condensed consolidated financial statements. The historical unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Prospectus for the three months ended March 31, 2013 have been derived or extracted from the Issuer's

<<<

 unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements. These financial statements are incorporated through reference into this Prospectus.
Various numbers and percentages set forth in this Prospectus have been rounded and accordingly

<<<

 may not present exact totals.
In "Summary--Summary Consolidated Historical and Recalculated Financial and Other Information" we also present other recalculated information adjusted to give effect to the issuance of the Notes and the application

<<<

 of the proceeds therefrom as set forth under "Use of Proceeds."
Unless otherwise indicated in this Prospectus, we have, solely for your convenience, translated Swedish krona amounts into euro (i) in respect of income statement data for the

<<<

 year ended December 31, 2012 and the twelve months ended March 31, 2013, at a rate of exchange of SEK8.7064 to 1.00 and SEK8.6185 to 1.00, respectively, representing the average rate of exchange for the respective periods as published by Bloomberg

<<<

 (London Composite Rate) and (ii) in respect of balance sheet data as of December 31, 2012 and March 31, 2013, at a rate of exchange of SEK8.5828 to 1.00 and SEK8.3679 to 1.00, respectively, representing the rate of exchange as of the respective

<<<

 dates as published by Bloomberg (London Composite Rate). For all other convenience translations we have used the average rate of exchange applicable for the date or period, as the case may be, presented in this Prospectus under the heading

<<<

 "Exchange Rate Information." The translation of income statement and balance sheet transactions expressed in Swedish krona using such rates may result in the presentation of euro amounts that differ from the euro amounts that would have been

<<<

 obtained by translating Swedish krona into euro at the exchange rate prevailing when such transactions were recorded.
Impact of the Acquisition Transactions on Our Historical Financial Information
We accounted for the Acquisition Transactions

<<<

 using the acquisition method of accounting, which involves measuring the cost of the acquisition and allocating it to identifiable assets acquired and identifiable liabilities assumed, measured at their fair values as of the date of completion

<<<

 of the Acquisition Transactions. The revenues and expenses directly attributable to the operations of the Predecessor were included in the Issuer's financial statements from the same date. The excess of the purchase price over these allocations

<<<

 has been assigned to goodwill, which is not amortized for accounting purposes but is subject to testing for impairment at least annually. In addition, we will incur a substantial amount of indebtedness as a result of the Refinancing (as defined

<<<

 herein), and our interest expense will increase in future periods.
In addition to changes to our financial statements resulting from the application of the acquisition method of accounting, due to the effects of the increased borrowings to

<<<

 finance the Acquisition Transactions, our interest expense has increased significantly following the Acquisition Transactions. As a result, the financial information for periods beginning on or after December 31, 2012 for the Successor may

<<<

 not be comparable to the financial information of the Predecessor for periods prior to this date.
The Issuer will be our continuing reporting entity going forward but the impact of the Acquisition Transactions and the Refinancing on our financial

<<<

 statements will affect the comparability of our future financial information with the historical financial information of our Predecessor. Acquisition Transactions-related costs were recognized for the Issuer in profit or loss as incurred.

<<<


Non-IFRS Financial and Operating Information
Certain financial measures and ratios related thereto in this Prospectus, including EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (collectively, the "EBITDA Metrics"), are not specifically defined under IFRS or any

<<<

 other generally accepted accounting principles. These measures are presented in this Prospectus because we believe that they are among the measures used by management to evaluate the cash available to us to fund ongoing, long-term obligations

<<<

 and they are frequently used by securities analysts, high yield investors and other interested parties for valuation purposes or as a common measure of the ability of issuers to incur and meet debt service obligations. These measures may not

<<<

 be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other
49

companies and are not measurements under IFRS or other generally accepted accounting principles, and you should not consider such items as alternatives to net income (loss), operating

<<<

 income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS, and they may be different from similarly titled measures used by other companies. Our management believes this information, along with comparable IFRS measures, is useful

<<<

 to investors because it provides a basis for measuring the operating performance in the periods presented. These measures are used in the internal management of our business, along with the most directly comparable IFRS financial measures,

<<<

 in evaluating the operating performance.
The EBITDA Metrics have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results or any performance measures under IFRS as set forth

<<<

 in our financial statements. Some of these limitations are:
· they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures;
· they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

<<<


· they do not reflect the interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt;
· they do not reflect any cash income taxes that we may be required to pay;
· they are not adjusted for all non

<<<

-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our consolidated income statement;
· they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations;
· assets

<<<

 are depreciated or amortized over differing estimated useful lives and often have to be replaced in the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and
· other companies in our industry may calculate

<<<

 these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.
Because of these limitations the EBITDA Metrics should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of

<<<

 our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our IFRS results and using these non-IFRS measures only supplementally to evaluate

<<<

 our performance. You are encouraged to evaluate each of the adjustments reflected in our presentation of the EBITDA Metrics and whether you consider each to be appropriate. See "Summary--Summary Consolidated Historical and Recalculated Financial

<<<

 and Other Information," "Selected Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Information," "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes

<<<

 which are incorporated through reference into this Prospectus.
For a description of how our EBITDA Metrics are calculated from our consolidated result from operations and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to our results for the period presented

<<<

 in this Prospectus and a calculation of our other EBITDA Metrics, see "Summary--Summary Consolidated Historical and Recalculated Financial and Other Information."
Free cash flow is a supplemental measure of our liquidity and cash flow that

<<<

 is not required by or presented in accordance with IFRS or other generally accepted accounting principles. We present free cash flow in this Prospectus because we believe that free cash flow provides useful information to investors about our

<<<

 business and our liquidity and cash flow. Free cash flow is not a measurement of our liquidity or results of operations under IFRS or other generally accepted accounting principles and has limitations as an analytical tool. This measure may

<<<

 not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and is not a measurement under IFRS or other generally accepted accounting principles, and you should not consider such items as alternatives to cash flow from operating

<<<

 activities, profit/(loss) for the period or any other performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our IFRS results and using this non-IFRS measure only supplementally

<<<

 to evaluate our performance. You are encouraged to evaluate the methodology used to calculate free cash flow and whether you consider it to be appropriate.
Financial Information for the Twelve Months Ended March 31, 2013
The unaudited recalculated

<<<

 condensed consolidated financial information for the twelve months ended March 31, 2013 set forth in this Prospectus was derived by adding the unaudited recalculated condensed consolidated financial information of Bravida AB for the fiscal

<<<

 year ended December 31, 2012 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial information of the Issuer for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and subtracting the unaudited recalculated condensed consolidated financial data of Bravida AB

<<<

 for the three months ended March 31, 2012. The summary unaudited consolidated financial data for the twelve months ended March 31, 2013 is not required by or presented in accordance with IFRS or generally accepted accounting principles, and

<<<

 has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily representative of our results of operations for any future period or our financial condition at any future date.

Presentation of Segment Information Segment information

<<<

 presented in this Prospectus representing net sales from our installation and services businesses
are based on our classification of our profit centers. Each of our local branches is divided into one or more profit centers that predominantly

<<<

 engage in either our installation business or our services business. For purposes of our segment reporting, we classify net sales generated from profit centers that predominantly provide installation solutions as net sales from our installation

<<<

 business and the net sales generated from profit centers that predominantly provide service solutions as net sales from our services business. To the extent that a profit center operates in both of our business areas and provides installation

<<<

 as well as service solutions, for purposes of our segment reporting, we allocate all of the net sales generated by such profit center to either one of our business area segments, based on the operations predominantly conducted by that profit

<<<

 center. For example, if a profit center predominantly conducts our installation business, we record the total net sales generated by that profit center as net sales from installation. The presentation of segment information by business area

<<<

 in this Prospectus is therefore based on our own classification. We review the classification of our profit centers on a regular basis and they may be reclassified from time to time. Market and Industry Information
In this Prospectus, we rely

<<<

 on and refer to information regarding our business and the markets in which we operate and compete. Certain market data and economic and industry data and forecasts used in this Prospectus were obtained from publicly available information,

<<<

 independent industry publications and reports prepared by industry consultants. Where available, we have presented market and industry information derived from third-party sources such as industry publications and research, as well as data

<<<

 reports, surveys and studies prepared by professional third-party organizations. In particular, we present in this Prospectus certain information prepared by Eurostat and Euroconstruct. In considering the industry and market data included in

<<<

 this Prospectus, prospective investors should note that this information may be subject to significant uncertainty due to differing definitions of the relevant markets and market segments described. In many cases, there is no readily available

<<<

 external information (whether from trade associations, government bodies or other organizations) to validate market-related analyses and estimates, thus requiring us to rely on internally developed data. Consequently, we have made our estimates

<<<

 largely based on internal surveys and studies.
In addition to the foregoing, certain information regarding markets, market size, market share, market position, growth rates and other industry data pertaining to our business contained in this

<<<

 Prospectus was estimated or derived from assumptions we deem reasonable and from our own research, surveys, studies and experience. In light of the absence of publicly available information on a significant proportion of participants in the

<<<

 industry, the data on market sizes and projected growth rates should be viewed with caution. Our internal estimates have not been verified by any independent sources and neither we nor the Initial Purchasers can assure you as to their accuracy

<<<

 or the accuracy of the underlying assumptions used to estimate such data.
All estimates involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors. The projections and forward-looking statements in this section are not

<<<

 guarantees of future performance, and actual events and circumstances could differ materially from current expectations. Numerous factors could cause or contribute to such differences. See "Risk Factors," "Industry" and "Business" for further

<<<

 discussion.
The tables below set forth, for the periods and dates indicated, the period end, average, high and low exchange rates published by Bloomberg (London Composite Rate). The below rates may differ from the actual rates used in the preparation

<<<

 of our consolidated financial statements and the other financial information appearing in this Prospectus. Our inclusion of these exchange rates is not meant to suggest that the Swedish krona amounts actually represent such euro amounts, or

<<<

 that such amounts would have converted at a particular rate, if at all.

UNAUDITED RECALCULATED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED

 FINANCIAL INFORMATION

The following recalculated financial information contains unaudited recalculated condensed consolidated income statements of the Issuer for the year ended December 31, 2012 and the three months ended March 31, 2012. The

<<<

 unaudited recalculated consolidated income statements of the Issuer for the year ended December 31, 2012 and the three months ended March 31, 2012 represent the historical unaudited financial information for Bravida AB, as adjusted to give

<<<

 effect to historical income and expenses recorded by Bravida AB's intermediate holding companies (Bravida Installation och Service AB (formerly Bravissima Acquisition AB), Scandinavian Installation Refi AB and Scandinavian Installation Acquisition

<<<

 AB (collectively, the "Intermediate Holding Companies")) and by Bravissima AS and the Issuer (formerly Bravissima AB) during the relevant periods and as further adjusted to give recalculation effect to the Acquisition Transactions as if such

<<<

 transactions had occurred on January 1, 2012. The unaudited recalculation adjustments give effect to:

· the acquisition on July 31, 2012 of all the issued and outstanding capital stock of Scandinavian Installation Refi AB and its subsidiaries

<<<

 by investment funds advised by Bain Capital. The Acquisition Transactions were accounted for under IFRS 3 (2008 Revised), Business Combinations ("IFRS 3"), using the acquisition method of accounting. The Successor recognized SEK4,471 million

<<<

 of goodwill as a result of the Acquisition Transactions; and

· the incurrence of indebtedness under the Existing Credit Facilities Agreement, which was used to finance a portion of the purchase price for the Acquisition Transactions.

The

<<<

 unaudited recalculation adjustments do not reflect any other transactions since January 1, 2012, including the Issue.

The unaudited recalculated consolidated financial information is presented for informational purposes only. The unaudited

<<<

 recalculation adjustments are based on currently available information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable under circumstances and supportable. The unaudited recalculated consolidated financial information does not purport

<<<

 to represent what our results of operations would have been had the Acquisition Transactions actually occurred on January 1, 2012, and they do not purport to project our results of operations or financial condition for any future period. The

<<<

 unaudited recalculated consolidated income statements should be read in conjunction with the information contained in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition" and the consolidated financial statements

<<<

 and related notes thereto which are incorporated through reference into this Prospectus.

The Acquisition Transactions

We have accounted for the Acquisition Transactions as a business combination in accordance with accounting guidance for

<<<

 business combinations under IFRS 3, and, accordingly, have recognized, assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value as of the acquisition date. The Successor recognized goodwill as a result of the Acquisition Transactions, which completed

<<<

 on July 31, 2012. Our unaudited recalculated consolidated income statements reflect adjustments related to pension liabilities pursuant to IAS 19. The effects of the financing incurred in conjunction with the Acquisition Transactions have been

<<<

 reflected in the recalculated income statements as an adjustment to finance costs. The aforementioned adjustments have been offset by the related tax effects, as applicable.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis is based on, and should be read in conjunction

<<<

 with, the audited consolidated financial statements of Bravida AB and its subsidiaries as of and for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, prepared in accordance with IFRS; the unaudited recalculated condensed consolidated financial

<<<

 data of Bravida AB and its subsidiaries for the three months ended March 31, 2012; and the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Issuer and its subsidiaries as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2013

<<<

, prepared in accordance with IAS 34.
Certain information in the discussion and analysis set forth below and elsewhere in this Prospectus includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See "Forward-Looking Statements

<<<

" and "Risk Factors" for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in the forward looking statements contained in this Prospectus.
This discussion and analysis should be

<<<

 read in conjunction with the financial statements described above and incorporated through reference into this Prospectus, including the notes thereto, "Summary--Summary Consolidated Historical and Recalculated Financial and Other Information

<<<

," "Unaudited Recalculated Condensed Consolidated Financial Information" and "Selected Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Information."
Overview
We are a leading provider of electrical, heating and plumbing, HVAC and other installation

<<<

 and services solutions in Scandinavia, in terms of revenues. We operate in the Scandinavian Building Services Market, which has historically demonstrated stability and resilience, having grown at a rate of approximately 4.5% per annum on average

<<<

 between 2006 and 2011. In 2011, we were the leading provider of installation and services solutions in Sweden and the number two and number three provider of such services in Norway and Denmark, respectively, in each case in terms of revenue

<<<

. With over 200 branches across 150 locations, we are one of the few companies that provide installation and services solutions throughout Scandinavia. In the twelve months ended March 31, 2013 on a Recalculation Basis, we recorded total net

<<<

 sales of SEK11,213 million (1,301.0 million) and generated Adjusted EBITDA of SEK632 million (73.3 million).
We provide installation and services solutions for new construction as well as for renovation and maintenance projects. Our installation

<<<

 business and our services business accounted for 48% and 52%, respectively, of our total net sales on a Recalculation Basis for the twelve months ended March 31, 2013. Our strong presence in both the installation and services markets enables

<<<

 us to cross-sell our offering to our customers in each of these business areas. Our installation business consists of the new installation or the redevelopment of, and adaptations to, technical systems in buildings, plants and infrastructure

<<<

. Our services business consists of the operation, maintenance, repair, replacement, reconfiguration and monitoring of installations in buildings, plants and infrastructure.
We operate our installation and services businesses in three principal

<<<

 fields of technology: electrical; heating and plumbing; and HVAC.
· Electrical. Our electrical installation and services solutions include integrated, energy-efficient solutions for the supply of lighting, heating and energy, including the

<<<

 installation and servicing of electrical infrastructure in buildings and industrial facilities. This field of technology accounted for 53% of our total net sales on a Recalculation Basis for the twelve months ended March 31, 2013.
· Heating

<<<

 and plumbing. Our heating and plumbing installation and services solutions include waterborne heating, cooling, sanitation and sprinkler systems. This field of technology accounted for 27% of our total net sales on a Recalculation Basis for

<<<

 the twelve months ended March 31, 2013.
· HVAC. Our HVAC installation and services solutions include ventilation systems for air handling, air conditioning and climate control. This field of technology accounted for 16% of our total net sales

<<<

 on a Recalculation Basis for the twelve months ended March 31, 2013.
We also operate our installation and services businesses in a number of specialist areas, such as fire and safety, technology consulting and technical services management

<<<

. Our other specialty installation and service solutions accounted for 4% of our total net sales on a Recalculation Basis for the twelve months ended March 31, 2013.
Our broad range of installation and services solutions for electrical, heating

<<<

 and plumbing and HVAC enables us to execute projects for a variety of infrastructure and buildings, creating a "one-stop shop" for our customers. Our ability to provide fully integrated, comprehensive installation and services solutions ensures

<<<

 that all elements of the solutions that we deliver to our customers work well together, and we are able to assume responsibility for all stages of our installation and services projects, from inception to completion. We are one of only a small

<<<

 number of service providers in the market able to compete effectively for both large, complex projects and smaller projects, owing to our range of expertise, ability to deliver comprehensive solutions and our long-standing local relationships

<<<

.
We have built a strong and diversified customer base across Scandinavia of over 50,000 customers, ranging from small and medium-sized enterprises that generate annual revenues of 50 million or less, to large corporations and public entities

<<<

 that
60

typically generate much higher revenues. We serve a wide range of end-markets across Scandinavia, including the construction, real estate, industrial and the public sector end markets. With a workforce of 7,868 employees, consisting

<<<

 of over 6,000 installers spread across Scandinavia, we have the ability to carry out a variety of projects ranging from small-scale, local projects to largescale, complex projects across multiple sites.
Our Segments
We classify our profit centers

<<<

 based on whether they are predominately engaged in either our installation business or our services business. For purposes of our segment reporting, we classify revenues generated from profit centers that predominantly provide installation

<<<

 solutions as net sales from our installation business and the revenues generated from profit centers that predominantly provide service solutions as net sales from our services business. To the extent that a profit center operates in both of

<<<

 our business areas and provides installation as well as service solutions, for purposes of our segment reporting, we allocate all of the revenues generated by such profit center to either one of our business areas, based on the operations predominantly

<<<

 conducted by that profit center.
Our results of operations are controlled and reviewed on a geographic basis and we organize our operations into divisions, which correspond to the geographic markets where we operate. Our geographic divisions

<<<

 comprise (i) the Stockholm division; (ii) the Sweden­North division; (iii) the Sweden­South division; (iv) the Norway division; and (v) the Denmark division.
Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations
General Economic Conditions
Macroeconomic

<<<

 factors in the geographic markets in which we operate affect customer demand and, in turn, our results of operations. These factors include GDP fluctuations in Sweden, Norway and Denmark, the three main countries in which we operate. During

<<<

 periods of strong GDP growth, our activity is fueled by industrial investments, public sector infrastructure projects and commercial construction. During recessionary periods, our installation business typically experiences a decline in net

<<<

 sales which correlates to reduced levels of capital investments by our customers. This includes reduced spending by national and local authorities, as well as industrial and utility companies, although public sector expenditure tends to decrease

<<<

 less relative to private sector spending. We observed certain industries reducing their activity levels beginning in 2009. Accordingly, we experienced decreases in demand in our installation business in 2010 and continuing in 2011, particularly

<<<

 in Denmark, which is our market that was most affected by the economic downturn and the monetary crisis in the European Union. In particular, we experienced reduced demand from manufacturing companies and building developers. However, during

<<<

 recessionary periods, when customers significantly reduce their capital expenditures, demand in our services business, which is mainly driven by renovation and maintenance expenditures, has been generally resilient to macroeconomic changes

<<<

 and tends to be countercyclical, providing a more stable source of income. When macroeconomic conditions improve, we generally experience increases in revenues in both our installation business and our services business.
Flexible Cost Structure

<<<


We have a flexible cost structure, which helps to preserve margins during economic downturns. Variable and semivariable costs (including subcontracting costs, temporary and fixed-term employees and installation materials and consumables used

<<<

) constitute the majority of our operating expenses. We maintain low levels of inventory and our suppliers deliver directly to our work sites, which helps reduce our fixed costs and allows us to adjust our cost structure in response to market

<<<

 demand. We also have flexibility to improve our cost structure through personnel relocations and reductions. For example, in March 2013, we relocated a team of installers from our Sweden­South division to Norway, where we were experiencing

<<<

 higher demand for our services but had limited numbers of skilled personnel available to address the requirements of our customers. Approximately 25% of our labor costs are attributable to sub-contractors, allowing us to quickly adjust personnel

<<<

 levels and costs by increasing or decreasing sub-contracted personnel as needed. Additionally, as a result of the employment laws in the countries where we operate, we believe that we have the ability to actively manage the size of our workforce

<<<

 by implementing personnel reductions, typically within three and twelve months.
Seasonality
Our revenues and costs are subject to seasonal variation, limiting the overall comparability of interim financial periods. We account for revenue in

<<<

 accordance with the degree of completion of the project. Therefore, when a public holiday falls in a given interim period, there are fewer working days and as a result we recognize less revenue from our ongoing projects. For example, for the

<<<

 three months ended March 31, 2013, our net sales and costs of production decreased as a result of the Easter holiday falling in March.
Our working capital needs are seasonal, although they are generally negative due to our customer contracts

<<<

 and focus on invoice collection. We invoice our customers monthly, in the case of ongoing and completed installation projects, and daily, in the case of completed service projects. The month immediately following the end of a quarter generally

<<<

 has our strongest cash flow, and December is also typically high in connection with year-end payments. Cash flow tends to be generally the strongest in the fourth quarter, with public and private sector customers seeking to meet their maintenance

<<<

 and operating expenses budgets. Cash flow in August and September tends to be weak because of lower business activity in the month of July, which is the main annual holiday period in our markets.
61

Foreign Currency Exchange Rates
Our reported

<<<

 results of operations and financial condition are affected by exchange rate fluctuations due to both transactional and translation risk.
Transactional risk: Transactional risk arises when our subsidiaries execute transactions in a currency

<<<

 other than their functional currency. We operate primarily in Sweden, Norway and Denmark. As a result, we generate a portion of our sales and generate a portion of our costs in currencies other than Swedish kronor. Where we are unable to match

<<<

 sales received in foreign currencies with costs paid in the same currency, our results of operations are impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations. We generally benefit from a natural hedge against currency fluctuations in the three countries

<<<

 in which we operate because we incur costs and receive revenues in the applicable local currency. However, we purchase equipment from suppliers who generally operate in euro, and these suppliers may change their Swedish kronor prices to reflect

<<<

 fluctuations in the Swedish kronor to euro exchange rate.
Translation risk: We present our consolidated financial statements in Swedish kronor. Accordingly, we are exposed to translation risk when we translate assets, liabilities, income and

<<<

 expenses of our Norwegian and Danish operations into Swedish kronor at then-applicable exchange rates when preparing our consolidated financial statements. For our income statement items, this translation is made using the average year to date

<<<

 exchange rates over the relevant period. For balance sheet items, we make this translation using exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. The translation differences from the translation of foreign operations for the years ended December

<<<

 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012 had a negative impact of SEK54.0 million (5.7 million), SEK5.0 million (0.6 million) and SEK12.0 million (1.4 million), respectively, on our total earnings.
Although we have relatively low exposure to the transaction

<<<

 risk, fluctuations in currency rates against Swedish kronor have a translation impact on the Swedish kronor value of our income, costs and other financial results. We did not experience significant gains or losses as a result of fluctuations

<<<

 of Norwegian kroner and Danish kroner against Swedish kronor during the periods under review.
Equipment and Materials Used
We purchase equipment (machinery, technical equipment and installation equipment) and installation materials in the ordinary

<<<

 course of our business. Our expenses for this equipment and these materials are subject to fluctuations based on our activity levels and the prices of the equipment and materials we purchase. During periods of strong economic growth, our expenditures

<<<

 on equipment and other materials are higher, due to the fact that our installation business, which requires more purchases of materials, makes up a larger share of our total sales than is the case during recessionary periods. When our demand

<<<

 for equipment and materials increases, we seek to consolidate our purchases to achieve volume-based discounts from our suppliers. During economic downturns, when our services business makes up a larger share of our total sales than our installation

<<<

 business, our expenditures on equipment and other materials are lower, due to the fact that maintenance services require the use of less equipment and materials. The prices of the equipment we purchase are subject to variation based on the

<<<

 fluctuations in the prices of raw materials (primarily aluminum, copper and steel) used to produce that equipment.
Acquisitions and Dispositions
In recent years, external growth has contributed to the overall growth of our business, and we

<<<

 intend to continue to pursue acquisitions in order to increase our market presence, our service offering and our service capacity. In 2010, we made three small "bolt-on" acquisitions in Sweden, Norway and Denmark. In 2011, we made ten small

<<<

 "bolt-on" acquisitions in Sweden and Norway, and as a result, our net sales increased by SEK142.8 million. In 2012, we completed seven small "bolt-on" acquisitions in Sweden, Norway and Denmark, as a result of which our net sales increased

<<<

 by SEK179.2 million. We did not complete any acquisitions in the first quarter of 2013.
Active Portfolio Management
We generally seek to maintain balanced and sustained revenue flows by prioritizing smaller, shorter-term, high-margin contracts

<<<

 and maintaining a balance between installation and services contracts with a diverse range of customers operating in various end-markets. When one of our end-markets, such as industrial manufacturing, is experiencing lower expenditure, we can

<<<

 benefit from increased spending in another sector, such as mining. We also actively reallocate resources from less profitable regions to more profitable regions in response to demand in those regions. We also actively manage our installation

<<<

 business order book, which we track with two metrics we call order intake and order backlog. Order intake represents the value of installation projects we commit to during any relevant period, plus changes to existing projects made during that

<<<

 period. Order backlog represents the value of remaining (not yet accrued) project revenues from orders on hand at the end of any relevant period. These two metrics provide us with visibility on near-term revenues. In 2011, 2012 and the first

<<<

 quarter of 2013, our order intake increased for larger projects that only few providers, like us, have the size and scale to complete.
The Acquisition Transactions
We completed the Acquisition Transactions on July 31, 2012. The Acquisition

<<<

 Transactions and the payment of related transaction expenses were financed with borrowings under our Existing Credit Facilities Agreement and equity contributions from our shareholders. As of July 31, 2012, we had total debt of SEK2,804 million

<<<

 and cash and cash equivalents of SEK220 million.
62

Substantially all of such cash and cash equivalents were used shortly thereafter to pay costs associated with the Acquisition Transactions, and had been earmarked for this purpose.
The Acquisition

<<<

 Transactions had a significant effect on our results of operations, in particular:
· we incurred significant indebtedness and thereby increased our total liabilities. As of March 31, 2013, we had SEK2,788 million of financial indebtedness,

<<<

 all of which was outstanding under our Existing Credit Facilities Agreement. The proceeds from the Issue were used to repay in full all amounts outstanding under our Existing Credit Facilities Agreement on the Issue Date and to pay fees and

<<<

 expenses in connection with the Issue (see "Use of Proceeds");
· our results of operations, and particularly our financial expense, have been, and will remain, significantly affected by our increased indebtedness. The increase in our financial

<<<

 expense had, and will continue to have, a significant negative impact on our cash; and
· the Acquisition Transactions were accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. As a result, we allocated the aggregate acquisition consideration

<<<

 to the intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values estimated as of the completion date of the Acquisition Transactions, which resulted in an increase in our intangible assets, particularly goodwill

<<<

.
Description of Key Line Items
Income Statement Data
Set forth below is a brief description of our key income statement line items.
Net sales consists of the total revenues from our installation and services businesses over the relevant periods

<<<

. In our installation business, net sales are recognized in accordance with the percentage of completion method, which calculates net sales in proportion to the degree of completion of our installation projects. In our services business, net

<<<

 sales are also recognized in accordance with the percentage of completion method. For a description of our revenue recognition policy, please see "--Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates--Critical Accounting Policies--Revenue."
Costs of

<<<

 production primarily consist of (i) personnel expenses, including wages, bonuses and social security costs, (ii) the purchase and consumption of equipment and materials, (iii) subcontracting costs and (iv) other miscellaneous costs (including

<<<

 vehicle costs). Personnel expenses represent approximately 44% of our costs of production and equipment and materials expenses each represent approximately 46% of our costs of production.
Administrative and selling expenses primarily consists

<<<

 of personnel expenses in connection with the general management of our business, including wages, bonuses, and social security costs, rental costs for premises, vehicle costs and overhead costs.
Other operating expenses primarily consists of

<<<

 restructuring costs, acquisition costs and other non-recurring items.
Net financial expense primarily consists of cash and non-cash interest expenses on debt, including expenses relating to the Acquisition Transactions, the Existing Credit

<<<

 Facilities Agreement, as well as other financial items, net of interest on deposits.
Tax on profit consists of corporate tax in each country in which we operate, as well as deferred taxes.

Three Months Ended March 31, 2013 Compared with Recalculated Three Months Ended March 31, 2012
In this section, we compare our unaudited interim income statement for the three months ended

<<<

 March 31, 2013 with our unaudited recalculated income statement for three months ended March 31, 2012. Our unaudited recalculated income statement for the three months ended March 31, 2012 gives recalculation effect to the Acquisition Transactions

<<<

 as if they had occurred on January 1, 2012. Due to the effects of the increased borrowings to finance the Acquisition Transactions, our interest expense has increased significantly in periods following the Acquisition Transactions. Our selling

<<<

 and administrative expenses have also increased due to the annual management and consulting fees incurred in connection with the Acquisition Transaction and related transactions. As a result, the Issuer's results of operations on a Recalculation

<<<

 Basis for the three months ended March 31, 2013 are not directly comparable to the results of operations of the Predecessor for the corresponding period in 2012. The unaudited recalculated consolidated financial and other data for the three

<<<

 months ended March 31, 2012 has been prepared to give effect to the Acquisition Transactions in the manner described under "Unaudited Recalculated Condensed Consolidated Financial Information" and the notes thereto as if they had occurred on

<<<

 January 1, 2012. The recalculation adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable. The summary unaudited recalculated consolidated financial information and other data are for informational

<<<

 purposes only and do not purport to represent what our results of operations or other financial information actually would have been if the Acquisition Transactions had occurred at any date, and such data do not purport to project the results

<<<

 of operations for any future period.
Net sales
Net sales decreased by SEK187 million, or 6.4%, from SEK2,916 million for the Recalculation Basis Three Months Ended March 31, 2012 to SEK2,729 million for the three months ended March 31, 201

<<<

3. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net sales in both our installation and services businesses, primarily due to a lower number of working days in the first quarter of 2013 because the Easter holiday occurred in March, particularly

<<<

 affecting our services business in Norway.
Net sales by business areas
Net sales in our services business decreased by SEK107 million, or 7.4%, from SEK1,444 million for the Recalculation Basis Three Months Ended March 31, 2012 to SEK1,337

<<<

 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013.
Net sales in our installation business decreased by SEK80 million, or 5.4%, from SEK1,472 million for the Recalculation Basis Three Months Ended March 31, 2012 to SEK1,392 million for the three

<<<

 months ended March 31, 2013.

Net sales by geographic divisions
Net sales in our Sweden­North division were stable at SEK501 million for both the Recalculation Basis Three Months Ended March 31, 2012 and the three months ended March 31, 20

<<<

13.
Net sales in our Stockholm division increased by SEK24 million, or 4.4%, from SEK541 million for the Recalculation Basis Three Months Ended March 31, 2012 to SEK565 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013. This increase was primarily

<<<

 due to a bolt-on acquisition made in December 31, 2012, and was partly offset by the impact of the Easter holiday.

64

Net sales in our Sweden­South division decreased by SEK82 million, or 9.5%, from SEK863 million for the Recalculation Basis

<<<

 Three Months Ended March 31, 2012 to SEK781 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013. This decrease was primarily due to weaker demand from the manufacturing industry in the region.
Net sales in our Norway division decreased by SEK

<<<

70 million, or 10.6%, from SEK663 million for the Recalculation Basis Three Months Ended March 31, 2012 to SEK593 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013. This decrease was largely due to the Easter holiday, which is longer in Norway

<<<

 than in our other markets.
Net sales in our Denmark division decreased by SEK60 million, or 16.0%, from SEK375 million for the Recalculation Basis Three Months Ended March 31, 2012 to SEK315 million for the three months ended March 31, 201

<<<

3. This decrease was primarily due to reduced demand resulting from the ongoing slowdown of the Danish economy.
Costs of production
Costs of production decreased by SEK177 million, or 7.5%, from SEK2,358 million for the Recalculation Basis Three

<<<

 Months Ended March 31, 2012 to SEK2,181 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in activity, with net sales decreasing by 6.4% over the period, as well as to an increase in efficiency

<<<

.
Administrative and selling expenses
Administrative and selling expenses decreased by SEK58 million, or 12.7%, from SEK458 million for the Recalculation Basis Three Months Ended March 31, 2012 to SEK400 million for the three months ended March

<<<

 31, 2013. This decrease was primarily due to one-off recalculation adjustments relating to the Acquisition Transactions and to the implementation of cost saving initiatives throughout our business.
Operating profit
Operating profit increased

<<<

 by SEK48 million, or 48.0%, from SEK100 million for the Recalculation Basis Three Months Ended March 31, 2012 to SEK148 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013. This increase was primarily due to our focus on contracts with higher

<<<

 margins, our avoidance of high risk contracts, and our focus on controlling our costs of production and reducing our administrative and selling expenses, which resulted in improved margins.
Net financial expense
Net financial expense decreased

<<<

 by SEK277 million, or 81.2%, from SEK341 million for the Recalculation Basis Three Months Ended March 31, 2012 to SEK64 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013. This decrease was primarily due to the one-off impact of costs relating

<<<

 to the Acquisition Transactions.
Tax on profit for the period
Tax on profit for the three months ended March 31, 2013 decreased by SEK67 million from a tax benefit recognised of SEK48 million for the Recalculation Basis Three Months Ended March

<<<

 31, 2012 to a tax expense of SEK19 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013. The tax income of SEK48 million was primarily due to higher financial expenses, which were generally deductible for corporate income tax purposes, as well

<<<

 as a reduction in the corporation income tax rate in Sweden, from 26.3% to 22.0%. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2013 was 22.6%.
Profit/loss for the period
Profit/loss for the period increased by SEK258 million

<<<

, from a loss of SEK193 million for the Recalculation Basis Three Months Ended March 31, 2012 to a profit of SEK65 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013. This increase was primarily due to the one-off impact of the Acquisition Transactions

.
Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2011
In this section, we compare the income statement of Bravida AB for the year ended December 31, 2012 with the income statement of Bravida AB for the year ended December

<<<

 31, 2011. Due to the effects of increased borrowings to finance the Acquisition Transactions, our interest expense increased significantly in periods following the Acquisition Transactions. Our selling and administrative expenses also increased

<<<

 due to the annual management and consulting fees incurred in connection with the Acquisition Transactions and related transactions. As a result, the Issuer's results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2012 differ from the results

<<<

 of operation of Bravida AB. For a presentation of the Issuer's recalculated income statement for the year ended December 31, 2012, see "Unaudited Recalculated Condensed Consolidated Financial Information."
Net sales
Net sales increased by SEK

<<<

632 million, or 5.9%, from SEK10,768 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 to SEK11,400 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase was primarily due to increased net sales in our installation business resulting from a

<<<

 larger order intake at the beginning of 2012 and the end of 2011, which resulted in increased net sales in early 2012.
65

Net sales by business areas
Net sales in our services business was generally stable at SEK5,514 million for the year

<<<

 ended December 31, 2012, compared to SEK5,489 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.
Net sales in our installation business increased by SEK607 million, or 11.5%, from SEK5,279 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 to SEK5,88

<<<

6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase was primarily due to stronger demand in our Norway, Stockholm, and Sweden­North divisions, driven by public-sector investment in schools, sports facilities, hospitals and infrastructure

<<<

. Demand for large project orders increased, while demand for renovation projects remained stable.
Net sales by geographic divisions
Net sales in our Sweden­North division increased by SEK19 million, or 1.0%, from SEK1,970 million for the year

<<<

 ended December 31, 2011 to SEK1,989 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. This slight increase was primarily due to strong continuing demand in northern Norrland, particularly in the mining industry.
Net sales in our Stockholm division

<<<

 increased by SEK272 million, or 14.5%, from SEK1,880 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 to SEK2,152 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase was primarily due to strong demand (particularly from the public sector

<<<

) in the Stockholm region, where activity remained higher than in other more industryintensive regions of Sweden. A large portion of this increase was due to revenue from our contract with Facebook, pursuant to which we participated in the construction

<<<

 of Facebook's largest server hall outside of the United States.
Net sales in our Sweden­South division increased by SEK129 million, or 4.1%, from SEK3,138 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 to SEK3,267 million for the year ended December

<<<

 31, 2012. This increase was primarily due to certain major projects, such as the Clarion Hotel Post in Gothenburg and the Emporia shopping mall near Malmö, despite a weaker demand in certain industrial regions.
Net sales in our Norway division

<<<

 increased by SEK368 million, or 15.8%, from SEK2,328 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 to SEK2,696 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase was primarily due to stronger demand, both in installation and services

<<<

, partly offset by some price pressure. Demand was positively impacted by the growing oil and gas industry, as well as general growth of the Norwegian economy, which was impacted less by the global economic downturn than was the European Union

<<<

. Expressed in local currency, our net sales increased by 15% from period to period.
Net sales in our Denmark division decreased by SEK116 million, or 7.6%, from SEK1,522 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 to SEK1,406 million for the

<<<

 year ended December 31, 2012. This decrease was primarily due to weaker demand, particularly in the second half of 2012, which was impacted by the downturn affecting Denmark. Prices were also negatively impacted by that downturn. Expressed

<<<

 in local currency, our net sales declined by 4% from period to period.
Costs of production
Costs of production increased by SEK592 million, or 6.9%, from SEK8,573 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 to SEK9,165 million for the year

<<<

 ended December 31, 2012. This increase was primarily due to increased activity, as well as the lag between cost increases and the time when we were able to pass through costs to our customers.
Administrative and selling expenses
Administrative

<<<

 and selling expenses increased by SEK102 million, or 6.7%, from SEK1,531 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 to SEK1,633 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase was primarily due to an increased number of employees

<<<

 during the year.
Other operating expenses
Other operating expenses were SEK33 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to nil for the year ended December 31, 2011, as a result of the recognition of a non-cash loss on the sale of

<<<

 Aug Larsen AS, one of our Norwegian subsidiaries.
Net financial expense
Net financial expense decreased by SEK17 million, or 35.4%, from SEK48 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 to SEK31 million for the year ended December 31, 20

<<<

12 as a result of lower interest payments.
Tax on profit for the year
Tax on profit for the year increased by SEK39 million, or 36.8%, from SEK106 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 to a tax credit of SEK145 million for the year ended

<<<

 December 31, 2012. This increase was primarily due to higher taxable income.

Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2010
Net sales
Net sales increased by SEK423 million, or 4.1%, from SEK10,345 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 to SEK1

<<<

0,768 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. This increase was primarily due to a 10.9% increase in net sales from our services business, partly offset by a 2.1% decrease in net sales from our installation business. For the first time

<<<

 in our history, our net sales from our services business exceeded our net sales from our installation business.
Net sales by business areas
Net sales in our services business increased by SEK537 million, or 10.8%, from SEK4,952 million for

<<<

 the year ended December 31, 2010 to SEK5,489 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. We believe this increase resulted from our focus on our services business, which we intended to grow to a level equal to or greater than our installation

<<<

 business and ultimately achieved this level.
Net sales in our installation business decreased by SEK114 million, or 2.1%, from SEK5,393 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 to SEK5,279 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. This

<<<

 decrease was primarily due to a general slowdown in the markets in which we operate, particularly in Denmark.
Net sales by geographic divisions
Net sales in our Sweden­North division increased by SEK140 million, or 7.7%, from SEK1,830 million

<<<

 for the year ended December 31, 2010 to SEK1,970 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. This increase was primarily due to stronger demand from our manufacturing industry customers in the northern Norrland, and public sector investments

<<<

 and housing projects in southern Norrland.
Net sales in our Stockholm division increased by SEK40 million, or 2.2%, from SEK1,840 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 to SEK1,880 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. This increase

<<<

 was primarily due to strong demand from housing projects and public sector investments, particularly in the first half of 2011.
Net sales in our Sweden­South division increased by SEK207 million, or 7.1%, from SEK2,931 million for the year

<<<

 ended December 31, 2010 to SEK3,138 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. This increase was primarily due to higher demand, driven by infrastructure and housing projects and, to a lesser extent, offices and retail projects, partly offset

<<<

 by lower performance in the Jönköping region.
Net sales in our Norway division increased by SEK37 million, or 1.6%, from SEK2,291 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 to SEK2,328 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. This increase

<<<

 was primarily due to increased demand from manufacturing and housing projects. Expressed in local currency, net sales increased by 4% from period to period.
Net sales in our Denmark division was generally stable at SEK1,522 million for the

<<<

 year ended December 31, 2011, compared to SEK1,519 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Net sales were negatively impacted by the weakening of the Danish kroner against the Swedish kronor, but offset by improved performance as the

<<<

 Danish market began to recover from the recession. Expressed in local currency, net sales increased by 6% from period to period.
Costs of production
Costs of production increased by SEK368 million, or 4.5%, from SEK8,205 million for the year

<<<

 ended December 31, 2010 to SEK8,573 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. This increase was primarily due to increased activity in both our installation and services businesses. Costs of production increased slightly more than net sales

<<<

 over the year, primarily due to the lag between the occurrence of costs increases and the time when we are able to pass through such costs to our customers.
Administrative and selling expenses
Administrative and selling expenses increased by

<<<

 SEK12 million, or 0.8%, from SEK1,519 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 to SEK1,531 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. This increase was primarily due to increased activity in both our installation and services businesses

<<<

. Our "Good Process" cost saving initiative helped to limit the increase of administrative and selling expenses to a significantly lower percentage than the increase in net sales over the same period.
Net financial expense
Net financial expense

 remained stable at SEK48 million for both the year ended December 31, 2010 and the year ended December 31, 2011.

<<<

 ended December 31, 2010 to SEK106 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. This decrease was primarily due to the use of tax losses carried-forward in our Norwegian division.
Profit for the year
Profit for the year increased by SEK98 million

, or 23.8%, from SEK412 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 to SEK510 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.
Order Intake and Order Backlog for Installation Projects
We monitor our installation business through two metrics we

<<<

 refer to as order intake and order backlog. These measures provide visibility on our upcoming projects and operations, as well as an indication of our expected near-term performance.
Order intake increased by SEK249 million, or 2.2%, from SEK

<<<

11,315 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 to SEK11,564 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily due to major installation contracts and strong performance in Norway. As of December 31, 2012, order backlog amounted to

<<<

 SEK4,809 million, compared to SEK4,590 million as of December 31, 2011.
Order intake increased by SEK714 million, or 6.7%, from SEK10,601 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 to SEK11,315 million for the year ended December 31, 201

<<<

1, primarily due to strong performance in Sweden and Norway, partly offset by weaker performance in Denmark. As of December 31, 2011, order backlog amounted to SEK4,590 million, compared to SEK3,840 million as of December 31, 2010, primarily

<<<

 due to a number of large contracts attributed to us in 2011, for example our installation contract with Facebook.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
"Liquidity" describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flow to meet the cash

<<<

 requirements of its business operations, including but not limited to working capital needs, capital expenditures, debt service obligations, contractual obligations and acquisitions. Our primary sources of liquidity are provided by cash generated

<<<

 from our operating activities and our third-party financings. Our primary uses of liquidity are to meet our debt service obligations, to fund acquisitions and to fund capital expenditures.
Following the Issue and the application of the proceeds

<<<

 therefrom, our debt service obligations consist primarily of interest payments on the Notes and principal and interest payments on amounts drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility. We expect to fund acquisitions in the future primarily through

<<<

 drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility and with cash generated by our operations. We expect to fund capital expenditures primarily with cash generated by our operations. Although we believe that our expected cash flow from operating activities

<<<

, together with available borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, will be adequate to meet our expected liquidity needs, including our debt service obligations, we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow

<<<

 from operations to meet these needs or that future debt or equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, including making payments on the Notes or on our other debt when due. If our cash flow

<<<

 from operating activities is lower than expected, we may be required to seek additional financing, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Our ability to arrange financing generally and our cost of capital depend

<<<

 on numerous factors, including general economic conditions, the availability of credit from banks, other financial institutions and capital markets, restrictions in the instruments governing our debt and our general financial performance. See

<<<

 "Risk Factors-- Risks Related to Our Financial Profile--Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations may make it difficult for us to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and operate our business" and "Risk Factors--Risks Related

<<<

 to Our Financial Profile--We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness, including due to factors outside our control, and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness

<<<

, which may not be successful."

 from operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2013 increased by SEK14 million, or 5.8%, from SEK240 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012 to SEK254 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013, primarily as

<<<

 a result of a decrease in operating liabilities, partly offset by lower earnings before tax. Financial expenses were higher in the three months ended March 31, 2013 than in the three months ended March 31, 2012.
Cash inflow from operating activities

 for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased by SEK135 million, or 24.2%, from an inflow of SEK559 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 to an inflow of SEK424 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily as a result of

<<<

 lower earnings before tax and a SEK140 million increase in operating assets resulting from increased invoices at the end of 2012 that were not paid until 2013 and decreased trade payables, which were paid when due.
Cash inflow from operating

<<<

 activities for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased by SEK161 million, or 40.5%, from an inflow of SEK398 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 to an inflow of SEK559 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily as a

<<<

 result of accelerated invoicing as well as strong invoice payment by our customers.
Cash Flow from Investing Activities
Cash inflow from investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2013 decreased by SEK32 million, from an outflow

<<<

 of SEK7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012 to an outflow of SEK39 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013, primarily as a result of the acquisition of a subsidiary on December 31, 2012, for which the purchase price

<<<

 of SEK34 million was paid in January 2013.
Cash outflow from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased by SEK29 million, from an outflow of SEK66 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 to an outflow of SEK37

<<<

 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily due to a lower amount of cash spent on acquisitions.

Cash outflow from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased by SEK85 million, from an inflow of SEK19 million

<<<

 for the year ended December 31, 2010 to an outflow of SEK66 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily due to the acquisition of seven companies and businesses in the year ended December 31, 2011, the cash impact of which was SEK

<<<

52 million, compared to SEK2 million for the previous year.
Cash Flow from Financing Activities
Cash outflow from financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2013 was SEK50 million, primarily due to the repayment of an overdraft

<<<

 facility.
Cash outflow from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2012 was SEK408 million, primarily due to SEK624 million in dividends paid to our shareholders and SEK200 million repaid under our Existing Credit Facilities,

 partly offset by a SEK412 million contribution from our shareholders.
Cash outflow from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2011 was SEK453 million, primarily due to a SEK267 million repayment under credit facilities and a

<<<

 SEK150 million dividend paid to our shareholders.
Cash outflow from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 was SEK1,244 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily due to a SEK700 million dividend paid to our

Capital Expenditures
Capital expenditures for the year ended December

<<<

 31, 2012 amounted to SEK11 million, compared to SEK7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 and SEK4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Our business is characterized by low capital expenditures, which represented less than

 0.1% of net sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012. We expect to make capital expenditures of approximately SEK10 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. We plan to fund our future capital expenditures with

 to paying costs related thereto. These prepayment arrangements, along with personnel-related costs (primarily vacation salary), result in our negative working capital position.
Working capital requirements as a percentage of net sales was

(3.7)%, (4.3)% and (3.5)% for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively.

Hedging Obligations
The Issuer is (or will be) party to certain interest rate and cross currency

<<<

 hedging arrangements on or around the Issue Date to mitigate against its interest rate exposure under its Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes and cross currency exposures under its EUR Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes.
The Issuer currently

<<<

 intends to hedge at least 66% of the notional amount of its Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes for interest rate exposure and 75% of the notional amount of its EUR Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes for cross-currency exposure, in each case

<<<

, for a period of at least three years from the Issue Date.
Risk Management
We are exposed to various types of risks, both operational and financial. Operational risks are associated with day-today operations relating to economic activity, tendering

<<<

, capacity utilization, price risks and revenue recognition. Financial risks arise from the amount of capital tied up and our capital requirements. We believe we are exposed to greater operational risks than financial risks.
Financial Risk Management

<<<


In our installation business risks are asymmetric. In any given project, the chances of exceeding the expected outcome during the term of the project are limited while there is a risk of incurring significant losses in relation to the size

<<<

 of the project. The management of operational risks is a continuous process covering a large number of ongoing projects and service assignments. We have designed standardized methods to ensure that operational risks remain under control. We

<<<

 believe our systematic work on quality and environmental issues as well as occupational health and safety issues are key building blocks that underpin our management system. Our financial risks are managed centrally for the purpose of minimizing

<<<

 and controlling our risk exposure while credit risks are managed locally at each of our profit centers.
Operational Risks
Economic Activity
Fluctuations in the economy affect the building services sector, which is sensitive to market fluctuations

<<<

 and political decisions that can have an impact on demand for residential and commercial new builds and investments in industry and the public sector. Demand for service and maintenance work is less sensitive to fluctuations in the economy

<<<

.
Tendering
A building services company is exposed to commercial and production-related risks, which need to be identified and managed during the tendering process. To ensure that this is done, we have implemented process descriptions and checklists

<<<

 that are aimed at identifying and pricing the risks in our cost estimates and tenders.
Capacity Utilization
Capacity utilization is heavily dependent on demand in our geographic markets. An unforeseen decline in capacity utilization generally

<<<

 results in a loss of revenue, which in the short term cannot be offset by a corresponding cost reduction. We seek to mitigate these risks through continuous resource planning and by employing subcontractors during periods of peak production

<<<

.
Price Risks
Unforeseen variations in input prices and prices charged by subcontractors constitute a risk. We seek to offset the risk of rising prices through the use of contract forms that are appropriate for the project, indexation for fixed

<<<

-price agreements and efficient purchasing procedures.
Insurance
We believe we have adequate insurance coverage for our operations, comprising liability, contract and property insurance.
Internal Controls
Our Board of Directors acts as the ultimate

<<<

 source of internal controls. Our Board of Directors has delegated to senior management the establishment and implementation of a system of internal controls appropriate to our business. These controls include the safeguarding of assets; the

<<<

 maintenance of proper accounting records; the reliability of financial information; and compliance with appropriate legislation, regulation and best practice.
Our operations are decentralized. Management and administration are performed at

<<<

 the branch level by our branch-level managers at over 200 of our local branch offices in 150 locations throughout Scandinavia. Our branch-level managers report to each of our five geographic divisions comprising multiple regions. Each of our

<<<

 branches consists of, and is responsible for, one or
71

more profit centers. We characterize our profit centers as either installation profit centers or services profit centers, based on the predominant operations conducted by the applicable

<<<

 profit center. Branch managers report to our marketing managers at each of the five divisions and seek to maintain working relationships with local branches of construction companies, municipal authorities and local industries. Contracts with

<<<

 a value exceeding SEK50 million require approval of our chief executive officer. For a description of our corporate governance model, see "Business--Our Governance Model."
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Revenue
Revenue is recognized in the income statement when it is possible to reliably measure the revenue and it is probable that the economic benefits will accrue to the Group. Our revenue consists of revenues partly from installation contracts

<<<

 and partly from service contracts. Revenue is recognized in accordance with the percentage of completion method. This method is described below under "--Installation contracts." Interest income is recognized over the term of the loan by applying

<<<

 the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognized when the right to receive payment has been established.
Installation Contracts
We apply the percentage of completion method to our installation contracts. Under this method, earnings

<<<

 are recognized in accordance with the degree of completion of the project.
Determining the earnings accrued at any given time requires information about the following components:
· Project revenue--the value of all revenues attributable to

<<<

 the contract.
· Project cost--all costs corresponding to the project revenues that are attributable to the project.
· Degree of completion--recognized costs in relation to estimated total project costs.
Expenditure that has been incurred during

<<<

 the year but that relates to future work is not included in project costs paid at the time of determining the degree of completion.
These are reported as materials and inventories, advances or other assets depending on their character. Changes

<<<

 to the scope of the project, claims and incentive pay are included in project revenue to the extent that they have been agreed upon with the customer and can be reliably measured. A fundamental condition for application of the percentage of

<<<

 completion method is that project revenues and project costs can be reliably measured and that the degree of completion is determined in a way that is relevant with respect to the reliability requirement.
For projects for which revenues and

<<<

 costs cannot be reliably measured at the closing date the zero profit method is applied. This means that revenue equal to the incurred costs is recognized for the project, i.e. the profit is zero until such time as it is possible to determine

<<<

 the earnings. As soon as this is possible the percentage of completion method is applied. Provisions are made for expected losses, i.e. when the project costs are expected to exceed the total project revenues, and these amounts are charged

<<<

 to earnings for the year.
We recognize assets receivables (balance sheet item "Accrued but not invoiced income") from buyers of installation projects for which the project costs and recognized profits (after deducting recognized losses) exceed

<<<

 the invoiced amount. Partially invoiced amounts that have not yet been paid by the customer and amounts withheld by the buyer are included in the item Trade receivables. We recognize as liabilities (balance sheet item "Invoiced but not accrued

<<<

 income") any liabilities to buyers of installation contracts for projects in progress for which the invoiced amount exceeds the project costs and recognized profits (after deducting recognized losses).
Inventories
Inventories are measured at

<<<

 the lower of cost and net realizable value. This also takes into account the risk of obsolescence. Cost is determined using the first-in/first-out method (FIFO) method. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in our operating activities

<<<

 less any applicable variable selling expenses. The cost of our semi-finished and finished goods consists of direct costs of production plus a reasonable portion of indirect costs of production. Normal capacity utilization is also taken into

<<<

 account in the valuation.
Warranty Provision
A provision is recognized when the underlying product or service has been sold. Upon completion of the installation work a warranty period of 24 months normally applies. The warranty provision is

<<<

 calculated on the basis of previous years' warranty expenditure and an assessment of future warranty risks.
72

Translation of Foreign Currencies
Functional Currency and Reporting Currency
Items included in the financial statements for our

<<<

 various units are valued in the currency used in the economic environment in which each company primarily operates (functional currency). The Swedish krona, the functional and reporting currency of our Parent, is used in the consolidated financial

<<<

 statements.
Transactions and Balance Sheet Items
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates applying at the transaction date. Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from such transactions

<<<

 and upon translation of monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies at closing rates are recognized in the income statement. Foreign exchange differences on borrowing are recognized under financial items while other foreign exchange

<<<

 differences are included in operating profit/loss.
Financial Statements of Foreign Operations
Results and financial position for all foreign operations included in the consolidated financial statements that have a different functional currency

<<<

 than our reporting currency are translated into our reporting currency as follows: assets and liabilities for each of the balance sheets are translated at the closing rate income and expenses for each of the income statements are translated

<<<

 at the average rate all resulting foreign exchange differences are recognized through other comprehensive income as a separate part of equity (translation reserve).
Upon consolidation, foreign exchange differences arising from the translation

<<<

 of net investments in foreign operations are transferred to equity through other comprehensive income. Upon divestment, wholly or partially, of a foreign operation the foreign exchange differences recognized in equity through other comprehensive

<<<

 income are transferred to profit/loss for the year. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising from the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities in this operation and translated at the closing rate.
Employee

<<<

 Benefits
Post-Employment Benefits
In Denmark all employees are covered by defined contribution plans. In Sweden most employees are covered by a defined contribution plan, but a significant number are covered by a defined benefit plan. In Norway

<<<

 virtually all employees are covered by a defined contribution pension plan.
In a defined contribution plan, we make fixed contributions to a separate legal entity and have no obligation to make any further contributions. Costs are charged to

<<<

 the consolidated income statement when the benefits are earned.
Net liability relating to defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the future compensation earned by the employees through their employment in

<<<

 the current and previous periods. We bear the risk for ensuring that the plan provides the promised compensation.
The defined benefit pension plans are both funded and unfunded. In a funded plan the assets have been segregated, mainly in pension

<<<

 funds. These plan assets can only be used to make payments in accordance with the terms of the pension agreements.
The estimated present value of the obligations less fair value of the plan assets is recognized in the balance sheet as a provision

<<<

 or a non-current financial asset, as appropriate.
The pension cost and the retirement benefit obligation for defined benefit pension plans are calculated annually by independent actuaries. The obligation is defined as the present value of expected

<<<

 future payments to beneficiaries. The discount rate used is the yield on high-quality mortgage bonds with maturities equivalent to the average maturity of the obligations and the currency.
Actuarial gains and losses may arise when defining

<<<

 the present value of the retirement benefit obligation and the fair value of the plan assets. These arise either because fair value differs from the previous assumption or because the assumptions have changed. That part of the accumulated actuarial

<<<

 gains and losses at the end of the previous year that exceeds 10% of the higher of the present value of the obligations and fair value of the plan assets is recognized in the income statement over the estimated remaining period of service for

<<<

 employees covered by the plan.
The accounting policy described above is applied for the consolidated financial statements. Our Parent and subsidiaries report defined benefit pension plans in accordance with local rules and regulations in the

<<<

 country concerned.
A provision (or receivable) is recognized for special payroll tax when the pension cost defined in accordance with IAS 19 is higher (or lower) than the pension cost defined in the legal entity. The provision (or receivable

<<<

) is based on the difference between these amounts. The provision (or receivable) is not discounted to present value.
73

Termination Benefits A provision is recognized in connection with the termination of staff only when we are demonstrably

<<<

 obliged to
terminate the employment before the normal date or when compensation is paid as the result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. In the event of involuntary retirement we will draw up a detailed plan specifying, as

<<<

 a minimum, the workplace, positions and approximate number of individuals affected as well as the benefits for each category of employee or position and the date on which the plan will be implemented. Critical Accounting Estimates
The following

<<<

 is a description of certain significant accounting estimates and assessments that have been made in applying our accounting policies. Percentage of Completion Accounting
Reported earnings for installation projects in progress is accounted for

<<<

 in accordance with the percentage of completion method based on the degree of completion of the project. Use of this method requires that project income and project expenses can be reliably measured, which in turn requires a well-functioning

<<<

 system for cost estimates, forecasting procedures and project review. Forecasts relating to the final outcome for the project is a critical assessment that is material to the reporting of earnings during the course of the project. There is

<<<

 a risk that the final earnings for the project may differ from earnings as reported in accordance with the percentage of completion method.
Impairment Tests of Goodwill In estimating recoverable amounts for cash-generating units for the purpose

<<<

 of testing for impairment of goodwill,
several assumptions about future circumstances and estimates of parameters have been made. Changes in 2012 in the bases for these assumptions and estimates could have a significant impact on the value

<<<

 of goodwill. Pension assumptions
Management has assumed that the return on plan assets will exceed the discount rate by one percentage point, because this is the average return achieved over the last three years. To the extent that the actual

<<<

 return in 2012 deviates significantly from the expected long-term return, actuarial gains or losses could have a significant impact on the reported liability for defined benefit pensions. Similarly, deviations and changes to assumptions in

<<<

 respect of the calculation of the pension liability could have significant effects on the reported value of the net liability. Leasing
We lease a significant number of vehicles, mainly commercial vehicles. These have been accounted for in accordance

<<<

 with the rules for operating leases. Amendments to the accounting policies could affect the presentation of our income statement and balance sheet. Disputes
Actual outcomes for disputed amounts can differ from the recognized amounts, which

<<<

 are based on management's best assessment. Tax
Changes in tax laws and changes to practice in the interpretation of tax laws can have a significant impact on the size of reported deferred tax.

INDUSTRY
Overview
The Scandinavian Building

<<<

 Services Market comprises electrical, plumbing and other construction installation activities. The size of the Scandinavian Building Services Market was estimated at approximately SEK252 billion (28 billion) in terms of revenues in 2011, according

<<<

 to Eurostat. Sweden, Norway and Denmark comprised approximately one-half, one-third and one-fifth, respectively, of the Scandinavian Building Services Market in 2011.
The Scandinavian Building Services Market is a segment of the broader Scandinavian

<<<

 construction market (the "Scandinavian Construction Market") which comprises residential and non-residential building, repair and maintenance activities, but excludes civil engineering works. According to Euroconstruct, the size of the Scandinavian

<<<

 Construction Market (not including civil engineering works) was estimated at approximately SEK645 billion (71 billion) in terms of revenue in 2011. The Scandinavian Building Services Market has been relatively stable in recent years compared

<<<

 to the Scandinavian Construction Market. This was largely due to an increase in the density of installations in new construction as well as increasing demand for energy-saving and green solutions. An increase in public sector investments and

<<<

 larger infrastructure projects has also helped the market to maintain stability. These trends have led to the Scandinavian Building Services Market representing an increasing share of the overall Scandinavian Construction Market (from approximately

<<<

 29% in 2006 to 39% in 2011 (not including civil engineering works)).
We believe that installation and services offered in the Scandinavian Building Services Market comprise two distinct segments: (i) renovation and maintenance and (ii) new

<<<

 construction. We estimate that renovation and maintenance represented a larger share of the total Scandinavian Building Services Market than new construction in 2011.
· Renovation and maintenance. During economic downturns, customers have a

<<<

 demonstrated preference for renovation and maintenance as opposed to new construction, which has traditionally resulted in countercyclical effects in the renovation and maintenance segment. Expenditures on renovation and maintenance are more

<<<

 flexibly managed and constitute part of a customer's general operating expenses, making them less susceptible to reductions in customer spending and resulting in stable revenue flow. Moreover, demand for renovation and maintenance is primarily

<<<

 driven by the age and composition of real estate. The residential building services market in Sweden also presents growth opportunities owing to the high proportion of new residential buildings constructed under the "Million Programme" in Sweden

<<<

 in the 1970s that are now in need of renovation and maintenance services. EU directives on Energy Performance of Buildings and related regulation in Member States are likely to drive increased spending on renovation and maintenance activities

<<<

. See "--Growth Drivers."
· New construction. Macroeconomic trends have historically had a greater impact on the new construction segment compared to the renovation and maintenance segment of our industry. Demand for new technical installations

<<<

 has generally followed trends in investment in new buildings with a slight time lag. Although the new construction segment is generally cyclical, significant local and regional variations within different countries influence end-market exposure

<<<

. Generally, the public sector has exhibited less volatility compared to the residential or commercial sectors, primarily because government spending in Scandinavia has historically increased during economic downturns.
The Scandinavian Building

<<<

 Services Market comprises different fields of technology which span both the renovation and maintenance and new construction segments. We operate in the electrical, heating, plumbing and HVAC fields of technology. According to Eurostat, electrical

<<<

, which includes the installation of wiring and fittings, lighting systems, street lighting, electrical signals, airport runway lighting satellite dishes, alarms, solar energy collectors and connecting of electronic appliances, accounted for

<<<

 approximately 47% of the total Scandinavian Building Services Market in 2010. Heating and plumbing and HVAC, which includes the installation of plumbing, heating and air-conditioning systems, as well as their maintenance and repair, accounted

<<<

 for a combined share of approximately 47% of the total Scandinavian Building Services Market in 2010.
Industry Characteristics
Market Fragmentation and Competitive Environment
The market for building services in Scandinavia is highly fragmented

<<<

 with the three leading market competitor having a combined market share of approximately 17% in Sweden, 11% in Norway and 10% in Denmark. According to management estimates, the Scandinavian Building Services Market comprises approximately 

<<<

33,000 providers, of which the vast majority have few employees.
We believe that customers demand an increasingly broad range of services and expertise from service providers, including a single point of contact for delivery of integrated solutions

<<<

, in order to optimize their procurement process. Furthermore, we believe that customers often require a quick response for critical maintenance services, which requires close proximity to customers. We believe that this has led to the consolidation

<<<

 of small, local businesses into larger groups and international companies, including Imtech's acquisition of NVS and NEA in 2008 and 2010, respectively, and our acquisition of Siemens Installation AS in 2009.
75

In the case of larger customers

<<<

 with multiple locations, we believe that service providers need an extensive network in order to service these larger contracts. There are only a few building services providers in Sweden, Norway and Denmark that can deliver the full spectrum

<<<

 of services across all three fields of technology and have sufficient resources to deliver larger, multilocation projects, and include YIT Corporation in Finland, Imtech N.V. in the Netherlands and Bravida.
On a local level, there is greater

<<<

 competition with smaller companies, many of which specialize in a particular field of technology and regional area but are unable to offer "one-stop shop" solutions and compete on a national basis, including Midroc Electro AB in Sweden, Kemp

<<<

 & Lauritzen A/S in Denmark and ORAS AS in Norway.
Tender Process and Customer Relationships
Although the tender process varies significantly according to size and geographic location, larger projects in the Scandinavian Building Services Market

<<<

 are generally awarded based on price. However, we believe qualitative factors such as breadth and depth of services, overall project coordination, state-of-the-art technological know-how, the ability to provide customer-tailored adaptations

<<<

 and the ability to supply multi-location services across multiple fields of technology are important factors that are also considered.
Local contracts, which are generally smaller in size, are often awarded based on customer relationships with

<<<

 managers at local branches in addition to price considerations. Initial invitations to participate in tenders at the local level are frequently extended to providers with strong relationships with the customer based on past performance and

<<<

 local presence. Similarly, once an invitation to bid is extended, winning a tender in a local market usually requires close relationships with local decision-makers and a recognized local market share.
Barriers to Entry
We believe that there

<<<

 are very few providers in each market with the capability of providing services in multiple fields of technology on a national scale. This creates a barrier to entry on larger projects, but also across larger networks on national and regional

<<<

 bases. The requisite offering platform and network required to provide services in multiple fields of technology is costly and time-consuming to build. Barriers to entry for single services are generally lower at a local level, with customer

<<<

 relationships remaining a significant factor in winning business.
Late Cycle Exposure
The Scandinavian Building Services Market tends to be late-cyclical due to the fact that building services are provided at a late stage of overall construction

<<<

 projects. This provides some flexibility to adjust the cost base to the expected level of demand. In the new construction segment, local, regional and global economic growth are important drivers; however, the renovation and maintenance segment

<<<

 remains countercyclical and relatively stable.
Growth Drivers
In addition to macroeconomic indicators, the growth in the Scandinavian Building Services Market is driven by a number of factors, including (i) demand for more complex technical

<<<

 installations; (ii) the increased outsourcing of technical services; (iii) proactive demand for maintenance; and (iv) energy efficiency and sustainability considerations.
Growing Demand for More Complex Technical Installations
The use of technical

<<<

 applications in buildings, such as security and energy management, has increased over time. We believe that the Scandinavian population, in particular, tends to be at the forefront of adopting and utilizing new technologies. We have observed

<<<

 that property owners have increasingly requested more sophisticated, complex systems that require a high level of integration between different fields of technology, including cooling systems for server rooms, the laying of cables for broadband

<<<

 services and the automatic control of technical systems coupled with advanced lighting, sprinkler, alarm and access control systems. The share of building services in overall construction projects has grown from approximately 29% in 2006 to

<<<

 approximately 39% in 2011. With the increased complexity of installations, the need for reliable installation and service has increased.
Growing Outsourcing Potential
As a result of the increased complexity of installations, companies are less

<<<

 able to provide installations in-house. As companies shift their focus to core activities, we believe the outsourcing of complex installations will increase. The current level of outsourcing remains low, providing a significant growth opportunity

<<<

.
Proactive Approach to Maintenance
Although the approach to maintenance was more reactive in the past, the service market has become more proactive in its approach to service and maintenance. A growing number of property owners now realize

<<<

 that a well-defined strategy for service and maintenance tends to reduce the total cost of ownership over the life-cycle of a property by reducing accidents and production outages. We believe customers are increasingly more likely to request

<<<

 framework service agreements that cover the
76

servicing of an entire property and span several years as opposed to taking a more reactionary approach to service and maintenance as they have done in the past.

Energy Efficiency and Sustainability

<<<

 Focus

Energy is typically the largest running cost in maintaining a property. Property owners are increasingly choosing to invest in energy-efficient installations in order to strengthen the environmental profile of the property and reduce

<<<

 energy costs. We expect that more rigorous government rules, regulations and directives regarding energy consumption will continue to drive the focus of the Scandinavian Building Services Market. For example, under the Energy Performance of

<<<

 Buildings Directive (2002/91/EC) (the "2002 Directive"), the European Union aims to increase the energy efficiency of buildings. According to the Directive, the residential and tertiary sector, the majority of which is buildings, accounts for

<<<

 more than 40% of final energy consumption and 36% of carbon dioxide emissions in the European Union. The European Union's climate and energy objectives under the 2002 Directive include a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, a 20% increase

<<<

 in the share of energy consumption produced from renewable resources and a 20% improvement in energy efficiency by 2020. Buildings constructed after December 31, 2020 are required to consume almost no energy. On May 19, 2010, the European Union

<<<

 adopted the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (2010/31/EU) (the "2010 Directive") which recast the 2002 Directive as the main legislative instrument to reduce the energy consumption of buildings. Under the 2010 Directive, Member States

<<<

 must establish and apply minimum energy performance requirements for new and existing buildings, ensure the certification of building energy performance and require the regular inspection of boilers and air-conditioning systems in buildings

<<<

. Moreover, the 2010 Directive requires Member States to ensure that by 2021 all new buildings are "nearly zero-energy buildings."

Market Size and Development

<<<

 exhibited stability and resilience. The following table sets forth the real GDP growth rate in Sweden, Norway and Denmark from 2007 to 2012 compared to the European average.

Over the last few years, there have been regional differences in the development of the Scandinavian Building Services Market. Denmark has encountered difficulties through the financial crisis while Sweden and Norway

<<<

 have experienced comparatively better economic conditions. The Scandinavian macroeconomic outlook is positive with Denmark expected to recover gradually.

The Scandinavian Building Services Market grew at a compound annual growth rate of approximately

<<<

 4.5% from 2006 to 2011, despite the financial crisis and a slowdown in the underlying Scandinavian Construction Market. The growth has largely been driven by the increasing volume per building as well as raw material prices, consequently increasing

<<<

 the share of installation

77

cost per project or contract. In 2011, the Scandinavian Building Services Market represented approximately 39% of the Scandinavian Construction Market, compared to approximately 29% in 2006.

BUSINESS
Overview
We are a leading provider of electrical, heating and plumbing, HVAC and other installation and services solutions in Scandinavia, in terms of revenues. We operate in the Scandinavian

<<<

 Building Services Market, which has historically demonstrated stability and resilience, having grown at a rate of approximately 4.5% per annum on average between 2006 and 2011. In 2011, we were the leading provider of installation and services

<<<

 solutions in Sweden and the number two and number three provider of such services in Norway and Denmark, respectively, in each case in terms of revenue. With over 200 branches across 150 locations, we are one of the few companies that provide

<<<

 installation and services solutions throughout Scandinavia. In the twelve months ended March 31, 2013 on a Recalculation Basis, we recorded total net sales of SEK11,213 million (1,301.0 million) and generated Adjusted EBITDA of SEK632 million

<<<

 (73.3 million).
We provide installation and services solutions for new construction as well as for renovation and maintenance projects. Our installation business and our services business accounted for 48% and 52%, respectively, of our total

<<<

 net sales on a Recalculation Basis for the twelve months ended March 31, 2013. Our strong presence in both the installation and services markets enables us to cross-sell our offering to our customers in each of these business areas. Our installation

<<<

 business consists of the new installation or the redevelopment of, and adaptations to, technical systems in buildings, plants and infrastructure. Our services business consists of the operation, maintenance, repair, replacement, reconfiguration

<<<

 and monitoring of installations in buildings, plants and infrastructure.
We operate our installation and services businesses in three principal fields of technology: electrical; heating and plumbing; and HVAC.
· Electrical. Our electrical installation

<<<

 and services solutions include integrated, energy-efficient solutions for the supply of lighting, heating and energy, including the installation and servicing of electrical infrastructure in buildings and industrial facilities. This field of

<<<

 technology accounted for 53% of our total net sales on a Recalculation Basis for the twelve months ended March 31, 2013.
· Heating and plumbing. Our heating and plumbing installation and services solutions include waterborne heating, cooling

<<<

, sanitation and sprinkler systems. This field of technology accounted for 27% of our total net sales on a Recalculation Basis for the twelve months ended March 31, 2013.
· HVAC. Our HVAC installation and services solutions include ventilation

<<<

 systems for air handling, air conditioning and climate control. This field of technology accounted for 16% of our total net sales on a Recalculation Basis for the twelve months ended March 31, 2013.
We also operate our installation and services

<<<

 businesses in a number of specialist areas, such as fire and safety, technology consulting and technical services management. Our other specialty installation and service solutions accounted for 4% of our total net sales on a Recalculation

<<<

 Basis for the twelve months ended March 31, 2013.
Our broad range of installation and services solutions for electrical, heating and plumbing and HVAC enables us to execute projects for a variety of infrastructure and buildings, creating a

<<<

 "one-stop shop" for our customers. Our ability to provide fully integrated, comprehensive installation and services solutions ensures that all elements of the solutions that we deliver to our customers work well together, and we are able to

<<<

 assume responsibility for all stages of our installation and services projects, from inception to completion. We are one of only a small number of service providers in the market able to compete effectively for both large, complex projects

<<<

 and smaller projects, owing to our range of expertise, ability to deliver comprehensive solutions and our long-standing local relationships.
We have built a strong and diversified customer base across Scandinavia of over 50,000 customers, ranging

<<<

 from small and medium-sized enterprises that generate annual revenues of 50 million or less, to large corporations and public entities that typically generate much higher revenues. We serve a wide range of end-markets across Scandinavia, including

<<<

 the construction, real estate, industrial and the public sector end markets. With a workforce of 7,868 employees, consisting of over 6,000 installers spread across Scandinavia, we have the ability to carry out a variety of projects ranging

<<<

 from small-scale, local projects to largescale, complex projects across multiple sites.
Our customers are located in five main geographic divisions: Stockholm; northern Sweden; southern Sweden; Norway; and Denmark. These regions also constitute

<<<

 our reporting segments, consisting of: (i) the Stockholm division; (ii) the Sweden­ North division; (iii) the Sweden­South division; (iv) the Norway division; and (v) the Denmark division.

Competitive Strengths
Leading Market Positions in the Scandinavian Market Benefiting from Our Large Scale
We are a leading provider of electrical, heating

<<<

 and plumbing, HVAC and other installation and service solutions in Scandinavia in terms of revenue. In 2011, we were the leading provider of installation and service solutions in Sweden and the number two and number three provider of such services

<<<

 in Norway and Denmark, respectively, in each case in terms of revenue. We believe that we have achieved our strong market positions primarily due to our size and scale, wide reach and presence at the local level, broad service offering, long

<<<

-standing customer relationships, strong brand recognition and reputation for quality. Our strong market positions provide us with a number of significant competitive advantages including, among others, strong brand recognition in the markets

<<<

 in which we operate and the ability to attract and retain key personnel and customers.
In addition to our strong positions, we believe that we also benefit from our size and scale. We are one of a small number of service providers in the Scandinavian

<<<

 Building Services Market that competes on large, complex projects while also competing effectively on smaller projects, which we attribute primarily to our deep local relationships. We have an extensive geographic presence in Scandinavia, with

<<<

 approximately 200 branches in approximately 150 locations, which has helped us maintain and develop a strong customer base. With a workforce of 7,868 employees, we have the ability to carry out a variety of projects ranging from small-scale

<<<

, local projects to large-scale, complex projects. Due to our size and scale, we have been able to develop a broad offering of installation and services solutions. This has enabled us to execute projects for many different types of infrastructure

<<<

 and buildings, including hospitals, shopping centers, schools, residential buildings and industrial buildings, making us a "one-stop shop" for our customers. We believe our size and scale also allow us to command favorable pricing and rebate

<<<

 terms from our suppliers compared to our smaller competitors, enabling us to consistently achieve higher margins and offer more attractive pricing terms to our customers.
As a result of our strong market positions, broad service offering, reputation

<<<

 for quality and one-stop shop capabilities, we believe we have become the supplier of choice to many of our large customers who have large-scale, multi-site, complex projects. We believe we are attractive to these customers because we are able

<<<

 to assume responsibility for all stages of their installation and service projects. Our broad offering also gives us the opportunity to cross-sell our installation and services businesses and our different fields of technology to our customers

<<<

Favorable Macroeconomic Environment in Scandinavia and Attractive Industry Characteristics
We operate in Sweden, Norway and Denmark, which have historically exhibited greater stability and resilience compared to other European nations

<<<

. Between 2010 and 2012, for example, these countries experienced a real average GDP growth rate exceeding 2.0% per year, compared with the European Union which experienced a real average GDP growth rate of 1.1% per year. Scandinavian economies

<<<

 also benefit from relatively robust public finances and lower levels of sovereign indebtedness than most developed countries. In 2011, Sweden, Norway and Denmark had an average sovereign debt to GDP ratio of 4.0% (surplus) to 4.4% (deficit

<<<

) across the European Union. We have historically generated significant net sales from public sector projects (22% of our total net sales for the year ended December 31, 2012 were attributable to public sector projects), and have benefitted

<<<

 from the strong and resilient economic performance of the Scandinavian countries.
In addition to relatively stable macroeconomic conditions in Scandinavia compared to other European nations, we have also benefitted from certain growth drivers

<<<

 in the construction market. Installation costs as a percentage of total construction costs have increased in Scandinavia. We believe this is the result of increasingly stringent energy efficiency regulations in Scandinavia and a growing demand

<<<

 for technically sound and sophisticated building services providers who are able to deliver complex installation solutions to customers. This increased complexity of installation projects has led to a growing need for service providers who

<<<

 are able to provide comprehensive installation solutions that can be adapted to the particular needs of the customer. We also have a distinct advantage in being able to partner with major construction companies in our markets to tender jointly

<<<

, often on a cost-plus basis, for larger projects. We believe that our strong historical relationships with key construction companies in Scandinavia, such as NCC, Skanska and PEAB, have positioned us well to capitalize on this advantage in

<<<

 the future. Various market segments within the broader construction market in Scandinavia have also demonstrated resilience during the recent periods of economic uncertainty. For example, the Scandinavian Building Services Market in which we

<<<

 operate grew at a rate of 4.5% per annum on average between 2006 and 2011. We benefit from a strong presence in the renovation and maintenance market in Scandinavia, which represents approximately 59% of the Scandinavian Construction Market

<<<

 and has remained resilient through the recent economic downturns and the decline in demand in Scandinavia's new construction market of approximately 22% between 2008 and 2012.
Diversified Operations with a Large Share of Recurring Revenues

<<<


We believe that our diversified operations, including our broad customer base, various end-markets, wide-ranging service offering, extensive local networks, focus on maintenance services and small average order sizes, provide us with recurring

<<<

 and relatively predictable revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2012, our top ten customers represented 20% of our total net sales, and our largest customer represented 6% of our total net sales. Our customers' businesses range from construction

<<<

, the public sectors, and industrial sectors to private real estate, which has helped us to withstand adverse conditions in any single customer industry. Our customer base spans Sweden, Norway and Denmark and, as a result, our exposure to the

<<<

 effects of macroeconomic volatility experienced in any single country is reduced. Our broad range of installation and service solutions in the electrical, heating and plumbing and HVAC fields also protects us against a decline in demand in

<<<

 any one of these fields. We believe that such diversification reduces volatility in our results, limits our exposure to any single industry, country or field, and provides us with the flexibility to respond promptly to changing trends and customer

<<<

 requirements.
We also benefit from a portfolio made up of a large number of small contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2012, for example, 75% of our projects individually generated less than SEK10 million in revenues and 44% of our projects

<<<

 generated less than SEK1 million in revenues. A significant portion of our revenues are attributable to renovation and maintenance projects, which have historically exhibited resilient and stable growth, and consequently more-predictable revenues

<<<

 compared to our revenues from new construction. For the year ended December 31, 2012, 45% of our total net sales from our installation business was generated from renovation and maintenance projects with the remaining 55% generated by new construction

<<<

. With a strong presence in both the installation and services markets, we are able to cross-sell our offering in each of these business areas to customers. Moreover, our expertise in the electrical, heating and plumbing, and HVAC fields has

<<<

 enabled us to sell multiple addon services to customers who initially approached us for our services in only one field. We prioritize maintenance services contracts with our customers, the demand for which we have found to be relatively inelastic

<<<

.
Proven Ability to Sustain Profitable Operations Owing to High Revenue Visibility, a Variable Cost Structure and Effective Operational Structure
We have historically demonstrated our ability to maintain stability in our EBITDA performance and

<<<

 EBITDA margins, including during times of macroeconomic volatility. Our ability to sustain profitable operations is underpinned in large part by our strong order book and high incidence of repeat business, which together provide high revenue

<<<

 visibility. As of December 31, 2012, our order backlog was SEK4,809 million, which represented 82% of our installation net sales for the year ended December 31, 2012, and as of March 31, 2013, our order backlog was SEK4,914 million, which included

<<<

 net sales likely to occur beyond 2013 and represented 85% of our installation net sales for the twelve months ended March 31, 2013. We also benefit from a high rate of repeat business. For example, customers who did business with us in 201

<<<

1 represented over 90% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2012. In addition, the majority of our net sales from our services business is attributable to recurring service agreements which typically have terms of between one and

<<<

 three years, offering consistent and predictable revenue generation. We also have the ability to systematically pass through raw material price increases, such as price increases in petroleum, copper, steel and aluminum, to our customers, consequently

<<<

 limiting the impact of raw material price volatility on our revenue flow.
81

We usually experience the impact of adverse economic conditions late in the macroeconomic cycle, which allows for timely adjustments to our cost structure. For example

<<<

, in 2009, during the most recent economic downturn in Sweden, we successfully initiated cost rationalization programs early in the cycle with the aim of reducing our administrative expenses in anticipation of lower levels of business activity

<<<

. Additionally, we have in the past been able to relocate our personnel from regions experiencing lower demand for our services to regions experiencing higher demand, which gave us the flexibility to reallocate our resources based on market

<<<

 conditions and customer requirements. For example, in March 2013, we relocated a team of installers from our Sweden­South division to Norway, where we were experiencing higher demand for our services but had limited numbers of skilled personnel

<<<

 available. At the same time, we made a concerted effort to grow our more stable services business, signing agreements for a number of major service projects while market prices were still relatively favorable and performing those contracts

<<<

 later in the cycle. We also benefit from low fixed costs, because most of our costs are highly variable.
We believe that our management structure also contributes to the profitability of our operations. Our decentralized management model promotes

<<<

 enterprise and accountability at all levels of our structure and encourages local branches to operate as individual profit centers. We believe that the autonomy that we offer our branch managers incentivizes them to capitalize on their local

<<<

 market knowledge and to deliver strong results. We encourage our local offices to grow sales by collaborating with offices located nearby to increase the share of projects covering more than one field of technology. In a market that is predominantly

<<<

 customer-facing, the quality of our branch managers is fundamental to building and maintaining strong and lasting customer relationships. We believe that, due to our leadership position, brand visibility, national and local reputation and involvement

<<<

 in industry-leading projects, we have been able to attract and retain some of the leading talent in the industry. We closely monitor branch performance to identify under-performing branches, enabling us to quickly determine whether to restructure

<<<

 under-performing branches or to close them.
Strong Track Record of High Cash Flow Generation
We have historically demonstrated consistently strong cash flow generation, which we believe has been driven primarily by our negative working capital

<<<

 requirements due to required customer prepayments for installation projects and our historically low capital expenditure requirements. As a services company, our business is characterized by low capital expenditures, representing less than

<<<

 0.1% of our total net sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012. Our strong cash flow generation has allowed us to pursue our external growth strategy, and we have made more than 28 acquisitions since 2007. Our cash

<<<

 conversion ratio was 67.5%, 97.7% and 80.6% for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively.
Acquisitions in a Consolidating Market Supplement Organic Growth
We have a strong track record of organic growth, which growth is

<<<

 complemented by through acquisitions. We believe that our strong market positions give us an advantage in pursuing attractive acquisition opportunities, because providers of building services who may be contemplating selling their businesses

<<<

 are more likely to contact us rather than, or prior to, our smaller or lesser-known competitors. The Scandinavian Building Services Market is a highly fragmented market with more than 33,000 operators. We have market shares of approximately

<<<

 6% in Sweden, 3% in Norway and 3% in Denmark. The Scandinavian Building Services Market is composed of a large number of small companies, although approximately 89% of operators in the market had fewer than ten full-time employees on their

<<<

 payroll in 2010, which we believe presents attractive consolidation opportunities to complement our current offering. We believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this increasing consolidation in a fragmented market to grow our market

<<<

 share and presence. We have a strong track record of growth through acquisitions, having completed and integrated more than 28 acquisitions since 2007. We operate an organizational structure that encourages regional and local managers to identify

<<<

 and pursue accretive bolt-on acquisitions that lead to operational synergies, while maintaining group-level oversight over larger acquisitions. We follow a disciplined acquisition strategy focused on the retention of key personnel and the expansion

<<<

 of our geographic footprint and our technical capabilities, with a focus on attractively priced businesses that offer significant opportunities for margin improvements. We work to systematically improve our target companies' performance by

<<<

 aligning their operations with our business model, minimizing non-core activities, increasing shares of recurring business, expanding customer bases and rationalizing low-profit, high-risk projects. We have also sought to improve the profitability

<<<

 and cash flow of the companies we acquire by realizing synergies, particularly in purchasing and rationalizing their cost structure and support functions such as human resources, procurement and administration, as well as improving their working

<<<

 capital management.
Experienced Management Team, Incentivized Employees and Shareholder Support
Our senior management team is led by our chief executive officer Staffan Påhlsson, who has extensive experience in managing installation and services

<<<

 businesses, integrating acquired companies and rationalizing operational costs. Mr. Påhlsson has been with us for more than 30 years in various capacities, having begun as an electrical installer in our organization. Our senior management also

<<<

 includes a strong team of executive officers, including heads of our geographic divisions, who on average have over 20 years of industry experience. We believe that the incentives of our management are aligned with our long-term goals, with

<<<

 over 125 key employees holding an equity stake in our group. We also benefit from the extensive market expertise, business relationships and ongoing strong support of our shareholder, Bain Capital.

Our Strategy
Continue to Grow Our Leading

<<<

 Market Positions by Focusing on Our Local Operations and Investing in Our Employees
We aim to be the largest or second-largest operator in at least one of our fields of technology in each of the localities in which we do business. We believe

<<<

 that we are well positioned to grow our leading market positions throughout Scandinavia and strong local market positions by continuing to provide high-quality services and support to our customers and employees, and by focusing on our local

<<<

 operations. We intend to continue to operate a large, decentralized organization, with local branch units operating as individual profit centers. Maintaining a well-established, local presence throughout Scandinavia also provides our customers

<<<

 with a large number of local access points. We intend to continue to leverage our strong customer relationships and local market knowledge to meet our customers' needs promptly and efficiently, in order to establish ourselves as the provider

<<<

 of choice in the markets in which we operate.
Our employees are key to maintaining and growing our leading-market positions. We also intend to utilize our reputation, brand awareness and scale to continue to recruit and retain the best talent

<<<

 in the industry and to position us as the employer of choice. We intend to improve the performance of our managers and technicians by continuing to develop professional and technical training programs and by assigning our engineers and technicians

<<<

 to a wide range of fields. We also intend to continue to incentivize our managers and technicians by maintaining a performance-based compensation structure.
Continue to Improve Profitability Through Operational Excellence and Economies of Scale

<<<


While we differentiate our offering by providing consistent, high-quality installation and technical services and offering a wide range of services to our customers, we believe we also are able to drive cost savings by standardizing, simplifying

<<<

 and sharing systems and best practices across our group. In order to continue to improve our margins and cash flow, we intend to pursue the following initiatives:
· Sales initiatives. We intend to focus our sales initiatives on cross-selling

<<<

 opportunities across the electrical, heating and plumbing, and HVAC fields and on increasing the total number of customers that utilize our installation and technical services offering.
· Cost-saving initiatives. Our competitiveness and long

<<<

-term profitability depend, to a significant degree, on our ability to control costs and maintain efficient operations. We believe that we are well positioned to leverage our scale to optimize our cost structure. In particular, we intend to

<<<

 continue to reduce our costs by using our scale to negotiate volume discounts in supply chain sourcing and procurement, to focus on the disciplined management of our administrative costs and improve the efficiency of our workforce.
· Operational

<<<

 initiatives. We intend to focus our operational initiatives on developing local logistical capabilities in order to reduce onsite downtime, on effectively monitoring project costs and working capital requirements and on streamlining our operations

<<<

 across our network of branch offices. We recently completed an extensive diagnostic review of our operations and have identified several opportunities to improve operational excellence in these areas. We also plan to continue our strategy of

<<<

 rationalizing our operations that were loss-making.
Continue to Leverage Our Comprehensive, Integrated Offering
Many of our large customers are increasingly seeking providers who are able to operate in electrical, heating and plumbing, and

<<<

 HVAC, due to the technical complexity of the systems and cost pressures. Many customers are also making their purchasing decisions at the group level rather than on a facility-by-facility basis. This has resulted in a growing number of multisite

<<<

 contracts that require experience with different fields of technology, as well as the scale to enable the efficient management of complex logistics that are a part of large, multi-site projects. Our multiple locations and broad local network

<<<

 allow us to remain responsive to customers' needs, and to optimize our response to demand for increasingly complex installations. We believe that we are well positioned to benefit from these market trends, and that our wide range of expertise

<<<

 across various fields of technology, our technical and logistical expertise and our dense local network will continue to provide a "one-stop" installation and service offering.
Continue to Focus on Recurring Revenues
We believe that the diversity

<<<

 of our customers and our contract portfolio across our operating segments result in strong, recurring revenues, which help us withstand negative business cycles in any single aspect of our business. Under our business model, we avoid riskier

<<<

, large one-off contracts, which we view as riskier than relatively small contracts for recurring services. We intend to increase our share of recurring projects with all of our customers by continuing to focus on small installation projects

<<<

 and maintenance service contracts. We intend to extend this strategy to the companies we acquire. We also plan to maintain a balance between our installation and services businesses and to continue to capitalize on our ability to provide add

<<<

-on maintenance services following the completion of our installation projects.
83

Continue to Leverage "Green Economy" Initiatives As energy prices rise and concerns over climate change increase, local, national and regional authorities,

<<<

 corporate
customers and the public are increasingly demanding socially responsible energy consumption. We believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of growth in the "green economy." The energy consumption of a building is significantly

<<<

 influenced by the design of its electrical, heating and plumbing, and HVAC systems. As a leading Scandinavian installer and servicer of these systems, we are able to support customers seeking to optimize energy utilization in both new and existing

<<<

 buildings. We also offer energy efficiency solutions for several different types of power generation. We aim to increase our revenues attributable to the "green economy" by further developing innovative installation and service offerings in

<<<

 the area of energy efficiency. Continue to Grow Our Market Presence Through Bolt-on Acquisitions and Continued Participation in Industry Consolidation
The installation and technical services industry remains highly fragmented, presenting us

<<<

 with attractive acquisition opportunities. We continually evaluate opportunities to acquire and integrate other installation and technical services providers in Scandinavia in order to strengthen our competitive position, broaden the range

<<<

 of our offering and increase our presence in our existing markets. We make acquisition decisions at the branch level or centrally, depending on the size of the target and pursue acquisition opportunities that meet our strategic goals on terms

<<<

 acceptable to us. We believe we have significant experience in identifying, executing and integrating acquisitions while remaining focused on our financial policies. We intend to continue to grow through strategic bolt-on acquisitions by pursuing

<<<

 a two-prong acquisition strategy. First, in our core geographic markets, we intend to continue to consolidate our leading position through bolt-on acquisitions. In these markets, we intend to focus on targets that provide access to technical

<<<

 capabilities or geographic coverage that complements our existing capabilities and address any gaps within our current offering, particularly in Sweden and Norway. We also plan to identify targets based on their potential to supplement our

<<<

 offering in our strategic geographic locations. Secondly, we intend to grow selectively within complementary geographic markets, where we believe we will be able to efficiently replicate our core business model. We aim to continue to realize

<<<

 the operational synergies offered by the companies we acquire and to improve their performance by aligning their operations with our business. History
We were formed as a result of the merger in 2000 of BPA (Byggproduktion Aktiebolag), a Swedish

<<<

 building and installation company with an operating history of over 80 years that was formerly listed on the Stockholm stock exchange, and the installation business of Telenor AS, the incumbent telecommunication services operator in Norway

<<<

. In 2003, we acquired Semco A/S, an installation service provider, which helped us to expand our business into Denmark. Subsequently, we reorganized our corporate and operating structure by consolidating our subsidiaries and support functions

<<<

 across the group and focusing our operations on the core areas of our business. Since 2007, we have made 28 bolt-on acquisitions of small and medium-sized companies, expanding and strengthening our footprint in several key Scandinavian local

<<<

 markets. In 2009, we acquired Siemens Installation AS, further expanding our presence in Norway.
Certain affiliates of Triton Advisors Limited purchased a majority interest in our group in December 2006. On July 31, 2012, we were acquired by

<<<

 Bain Capital investment funds. Our Operations
We are a leading provider of installation and service solutions for buildings and infrastructure in Scandinavia. Our main business areas consist of installation and services. We offer our customers

<<<

 a comprehensive installation and secondary maintenance service in four fields of technology: (i) electrical; (ii) heating and plumbing; (iii) HVAC; and (iv) other specialty areas. We operate throughout Scandinavia under our five geographic

<<<

 divisions: (i) the Stockholm division; (ii) the Sweden­North division; (iii) the Sweden­South division; (iv) the Norway division; and (v) the Denmark division.

. Our Business Areas Installation
Our installation business represented 52% of our total net sales, or SEK5,886 million, for the year ended December 31, 2012, and comprises new installations as well as the renovation and maintenance of technical

<<<

 systems in office buildings, retail centers, apartment complexes, manufacturing plants, healthcare, education and government facilities and other commercial, industrial and institutional facilities. The majority of our installation business

<<<

 comprises "turnkey" installations (utförandeentreprenad), as opposed to bespoke installations, in which a customer purchases a specific function, such as a certain indoor climate. In addition, we also undertake general installations, ranging

<<<

 from smaller projects that involve the installation of individual units to more comprehensive projects that involve integrated building services solutions. Installation projects vary significantly in terms of value and length and may extend

<<<

 over several years. Depending on the characteristics of the installation project, different specialists and experts are involved (such as electricians, plumbers and fitters), which may also include subcontractors if the necessary skills are

<<<

 not available internally. Services
Our services business represented 48% of our total net sales, or SEK5,513 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, and comprises maintenance, repair, operation, replacement, reconfiguration and the monitoring

<<<

 of completed installations in buildings, plants and infrastructure. In our services business, we perform the following functions:
· maintenance and repair, which involves corrective maintenance to existing installations as well as periodic

<<<

 planned maintenance;
· operations, which involve the supervision and upkeep of existing installations; · consulting services, which cover statutory HVAC inspections and energy optimization; and · minor redevelopment and extensions, which involve

<<<

 repair, renovation and extension projects, as well as
adaptations for tenants, upgrading and modernization. Our largest services customers include large real estate developers and owners as well as certain public sector organizations.

Our Fields of Technology
We operate our installation and services businesses in four principal fields of technology: electrical, heating and plumbing, and HVAC, as well as certain other specialist areas.
Electrical
Electrical installation and

<<<

 services, which comprised 53% of our total net sales for the year ended December 31, 2012, or SEK6,004 million, consist of:
· electrical power switchgears, which direct electrical power safely downstream to consumers of the electricity supply

<<<

 and convert electricity voltage from high to low, depending on individual consumer needs;
· automatic control and surveillance systems, which can be programmed to integrate energy management and remote computer-based monitoring and remote diagnosis

<<<

 for security, fire, lighting, elevators and other building systems;
· security functions, including access control, closed-circuit television surveillance, and burglar and fire alarm systems, which can be integrated into automatic control systems

<<<

;
· lighting solutions, including configuration of the power supply and the installation of light fixtures in residential and commercial buildings, sports stadiums, parking lots and road tunnels;
· rail power supply systems, which comprise overhead

<<<

 lines as well as power substations where alternating current voltage is converted into 15,000 volt direct current voltage for rail traffic; and
· telecommunications and other light-current installations, including installations for telecommunications

<<<

, radio and data communication systems.
Heating and Plumbing
Heating and plumbing installation and services, which comprised 27% of our total net sales for the year ended December 31, 2012, or SEK3,065 million, consist of:
· water-based heating

<<<

 and cooling systems, which are used to provide heat through radiators or under-floor heating or to remove heat from components and industrial equipment;
· pumps, heat exchangers and boilers, which are required to heat rooms and tap water;


<<<

· district heating and cooling, which distributes heat or chilled water generated in a centralized location for residential and industrial facilities, which can provide higher efficiencies and better pollution control than localized boilers

;
· geothermal heating, which makes direct use of geothermal energy for heating applications, including borehole heat exchanges, which extract heat stored in the ground through a heat pump;
· sewage installations, used in both below and above

<<<

-ground sewage systems;
· sprinkler systems, which generally use water-based agents that are installed as part of our fire prevention solutions; and
· industrial piping, including expertise in all types of pipe welding.
HVAC
HVAC installation

<<<

 and services, which comprised 16% of our total net sales for the year ended December 31, 2012, or SEK1,824 million, consist of:
· indoor HVAC systems, which provide comfort cooling, air cleaning and heat recovery, while also focusing on energy

<<<

 efficiency;
· outdoor HVAC systems, which provide adequate air ventilation in road tunnels under varying conditions;
· building automation control systems, which are used to control a facility's HVAC system, often on a room-byroom basis, and

<<<

 can be programmed to integrate energy management and onsite or remote monitoring and diagnosis for purposes of security, fire, lighting, elevators and other building systems; and
· process heating and cooling systems, used primarily in industrial

<<<

 facilities to provide heating and/or cooling to precise temperature and climate standards for the products manufactured and for the manufacturing equipment.
86

Other
As part of the comprehensive offering in our services business, we also

<<<

 offer services in a number of other specialist areas that draw on professionals and resources from different fields of technology. These other specialist areas represented approximately 4% of our total net sales for the year ended December

<<<

 31, 2012, or SEK506.6 million. Through our various operating companies, we specialize in fire and safety technology, including alarm, surveillance and security systems; permanent, onsite maintenance services for customers' properties; and project

<<<

 management services in the construction and real estate sectors. We also offer rail technology installation relating to signal systems in Denmark, oil and gas installations for onshore and offshore maritime industries in Norway and energy management

<<<

 services for certifying and optimizing energy output.
Packaged Solutions and Integrated Offering
Our breadth and depth across business areas and fields of technology enable us to deliver a complete package of installation and service offerings

<<<

, ranging from complex integrated solutions to minor renovation projects. As a complement to our basic services, and in response to the industry trend toward increased demand among customers for a full-service portfolio among providers, we have

<<<

 created a number of packaged solutions, notable among them being the Bravida Plus project and the Bravida Energy Agreements. For our services business, we have created Bravida Service Agreements, which provide customers periodic and regular

<<<

 planned service and maintenance.
· Under our Bravida Plus projects, we offer complete installation for large-scale and complex projects under a single, full-responsibility contract. By assuming full responsibility for the installation, we can

<<<

 optimize all project installations while carrying out each task in a structured and efficient manner. This integrated approach seeks to improve overall functionality and promote more-efficient energy use.
· Similarly, with our Bravida Energy

<<<

 Agreements, we take an integrated approach to a property's energy consumption, offering a single integrated solution, improving administration and increasing cost efficiency. Our goal is to provide customers with lower-cost solutions over several

<<<

 years by reducing their initial investment in new equipment installation by implementing energy savings.
· On the services side, our Bravida Services Agreements comprise framework contracts under which we analyze and identify a property's specific

<<<

 requirements and produce proposals for short- and long-term improvements, as well as the regular service and maintenance of installations for the entire property. Our Bravida Services Agreement customers are typically regional or nationwide

<<<

 organizations whose operations are spread over a wide geographic area. However, we perform our work locally to ensure customers a single point of contact and competitive pricing based on local delivery of the service. Our local presence allows

<<<

 us to efficiently perform comprehensive analyses and comparisons showing our customers exactly where and how much energy they can save. Examples of the services we provide under our Bravida Services Agreements are: maintenance of HVAC installations

<<<

, filters and grills; energy-saving proposals; regular inspections of fire safety systems; server monitoring and software update; water and sewage maintenance; boiler room inspection; switchgear inspection; lamp and light fixture replacement

<<<

; the measurement and adjustment of pressure settings; and documentation and service reports.
Our Geographic Divisions
We operate in Sweden, Norway and Denmark, which accounted for SEK456 million, SEK132 million and SEK40 million, respectively

<<<

, of our Adjusted EBITDA on a Recalculation Basis for the year ended December 31, 2012. We operate under five designated geographic operating divisions, which also constitute our primary reporting segments, and include: (i) the Stockholm division

<<<

; (ii) the Sweden­North division; (iii) the Sweden­South division; (iv) the Norway division; and (v) the Denmark division. The chart below shows the distribution of net sales across our geographic divisions.
· Sweden­North division. In 2012

<<<

, the Sweden­North division was our second most-profitable division, with an EBITDA margin 5.5% for the year ended December 31, 2012. For the year ended December 31, 2012, the Sweden­North division maintained on average 1,353 employees and,

<<<

 as of March 2013, maintained 48 branches. The Sweden­North division has experienced variation in demand between different locations and regions. Areas of strong performance include the industrial segment in North Norrland, which improved in

<<<

 2010 and experienced strong demand in 2011, and public sector investments in the southern part of the division.
· Stockholm division. For the year ended December 31, 2012, the Stockholm division maintained on average 1,326 employees and, as

<<<

 of March 2013, maintained 25 branches. Regions within the Stockholm division are organized by technical field (electrical, heating and plumbing, HVAC, technical service management and other specialist areas) rather than geographic region. Large

<<<

, complex public and private investments are an important component of the Stockholm division's business operations and our major installation projects include civil projects, public transportation projects and sports arenas. Our competition

<<<

 in Stockholm consists of other national and international companies, who we compete with us for large, complex multi-technical projects.
· Sweden­South division. The Sweden­South division was our most profitable division with an EBITDA margin

<<<

 of 5.6% for the year ended December 31, 2012. For the year ended December 31, 2012, the Sweden­South
87

division maintained on average 2,289 employees and, as of March 2013, maintained 65 branches. Sweden­South division serves a mix of end

<<<

-markets in cities such as Gothenburg and Malmö, which in 2011 demonstrated the strongest demand in our installation and services businesses areas, particularly in infrastructure and housing. In recent years, the division has also experienced

<<<

 stable demand, strong market shares and high margins from smaller towns where we have a strong local presence. The Sweden­South division has benefitted particularly from growth in regional mining, increased expenditures on energy investments

<<<

 and growing public infrastructure expenditures. In 2010, the division implemented a merger of the two regions comprising the Malmö region, which strengthened the division's position in the Öresund region. The division seeks to continue to strengthen

<<<

 its local presence through acquisitions in line with our growth strategy.
· Norway division. For the year ended December 31, 2012, the Norway division maintained on average 1,903 employees and, as of March 2013, maintained 37 branches. The

<<<

 Norway division generated net sales of approximately SEK2,696 million. This division experienced significant public investment in 2011, driven by strong activity in the oil and gas sector and infrastructure, as well as increased demand for

<<<

 new construction in the industrial and residential segments in 2011, despite increased competition and price pressures. In 2009, the Norway division doubled in size as a result of our acquisition of Siemens Installation AS. In 2011, additional

<<<

 acquisitions in heating and plumbing in the Oslo region further strengthened the Norway division's market position.
· Denmark division. As of December 31, 2012, the Denmark division maintained 31 branches and 1,203 employees, while generating

<<<

 net sales of approximately SEK1,406 million. The division was impacted by macroeconomic volatility during the recent economic downturn, experiencing weak demand in response to a slowdown in the Danish construction sector. As a result, in 2

<<<

010 we decided to close our installation business in Sjaelland, which contributed to that year's decline in net sales. In 2011, the Denmark division intensified sales activities in the services business and continued to take a selective approach

<<<

 to contracts in the installation business in order to adapt to weak market activity, increased competition and growing pricing pressure.
In addition, the group maintains 58 employees whose function relates to the group's Swedish operations

<<<

 generally, none of whom are allocated to a particular Swedish division.
Our Governance Model
Our operations are decentralized. Management and administration are performed at the branch level by our branch-level managers at over 200 of our local

<<<

 branch offices in 150 locations throughout Scandinavia. Each of our five geographic divisions comprises several regions to which each branch-level manager reports. Each of our branches consists of one or more profit centers. We characterize

<<<

 our profit centers as either installation profit centers or services profit centers, based on the predominant operations of that profit center.
We interact with our customers at the branch level and have delegated to our branch managers completed

<<<

 autonomy and responsibility for maintaining and building customer relationships. Activities at the branch level include sales and invoicing, cost calculations, tenders, contract management, resource and staff planning, project execution, warranties

<<<

 and administration. Each branch manager is responsible for the organization, staffing and operation of installation and services assignments for his or her branch as well as the overall results, net sales, profitability and capacity utilization

<<<

 of the branch. We believe that our decentralized operational structure facilitates a deep local presence, heightened awareness of local market conditions and stronger ties to local customers.
Generally, the branch manager is responsible for

<<<

 the management of projects local to their area, including the organization, staffing and operational aspects of installation and services projects, ensuring that set targets for profitability and other goals are achieved. This facilitates face

<<<

-to-face contact between the individuals responsible for carrying out a project and the end-customer, helping to strengthen our business relationships with our customers and promote recurring sales through repeat business with these customers

<<<

.
At the same time, to create a cost-effective support structure for the local branches and branch managers, we have centralized group-relevant functions, such as our common enterprise resource planning ("ERP") system, purchasing and overall

<<<

 control. Our purchasing function is managed at a group level to ensure that we are able to leverage our scale in pricing negotiations with our suppliers. In addition, our larger, more-extensive projects may be coordinated at a regional, divisional

<<<

 or group level. We continuously work to refine processes such as planning, production and logistics and further improve existing sourcing processes and/or international sourcing channels.
In addition, we undertake frequent and rigorous performance

<<<

 reviews of each branch to identify opportunities for cash flow and margin improvement. We have a strong track record in restructuring underperforming branches. To the extent we believe a particular branch cannot be restructured effectively

<<<

, we may decide to close down or dispose of the branch. From 2006 to 2012, we closed several underperforming branches and sold certain branches during that same period.
The chart below illustrates our bottom-up governance model, noting the total

<<<

 number of our branches, regions and divisions as of December 31, 2012.

Our Customer Base and Customer Contracts Our Customer Base
We have a large and diverse customer base operating in a wide range of industries, including a significant

<<<

 number of customers in the public sector. Sales to public sector customers have grown consistently and became increasingly important to our business operations as demand from private sector customers declined during the economic downturn. Our

<<<

 customers range in size and type from private businesses and government entities seeking integrated installation projects to smaller, local businesses and local government entities requiring a one-time service. The chart below demonstrates

<<<

 the various end-markets that we serve.
Building contractors, who purchase installation services as part of larger construction projects, comprise our largest customer group, followed by public sector customers and real estate companies. While

<<<

 building contractors account for our largest customers in aggregate, we perform a large number of individual projects in partnership with these companies, each of which are separately negotiated and comprise a relatively small proportion of

<<<

 our overall sales. For the year ended December 31, 2012, building contractors accounted for 36% of total net sales, the public sector accounted for 22%, other business accounted for 16%, industry accounted for 10%, private property companies

<<<

 accounted for 8% and others accounted for 8%. Small and medium-sized projects, such as adaptations to offices, the redevelopment and extension of real estate and related services, are the largest contributors to our total net sales.
The graph

<<<

 below shows our net sales distribution across our diverse customer base.
89

For the year ended December 31, 2012, our ten largest customers together accounted for 20% of our net sales. Generally, our project base tends to consist of smaller

<<<

-scale projects, with 75% of our total installation and services projects being less than SEK10 million in value, and 44% being less than SEK1 million in magnitude. The average contract value for our installation and services contracts is approximately

<<<

 SEK24,000. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2012, over 90% of net sales were derived from customers who were also customers in the prior year. The chart below shows the distribution of types that exceed and fall below the SEK10

<<<

 million threshold.
Over the last few years, we have developed the expertise and resources necessary to carry out large installation projects and nationwide services agreements. Some of our more notable recent assignments include:
· the installation

<<<

 of ventilation systems for The New Karolinska Solna University Hospital in Stockholm, Sweden's first public-private partnership project in the healthcare industry and among the first in the world to be environmentally certified consistent with

<<<

 standards promulgated by the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (the "LEED");
· a services agreement with Nordea Bank in Denmark and Norway covering all three of our fields of technology; · the installation of electrical systems

<<<

 in a new central hospital in Østfold, Norway; · an installation contract for a new hospital in Aarhus, Denmark which, when completed, will be Denmark's
largest-ever hospital project;
90

· a turnkey installation contract for installation of

<<<

 all electrical, plumbing, HVAC, controls, sprinkler, elevator and cooling units in the new multi-sport facility in Gothenburg, Sweden;
· a multi-year contract to design, plan and install all electrical, heating and plumbing, and ventilation

<<<

 systems for Facebook Inc.'s servers in the initial part of a new data center outside Luleå in northern Sweden, which represents our single largest contract to date;
· a partnering contract with NCC Construction Sweden, which we won in the Malmö

<<<

 region for electrical installations in central Malmö, including a mall, offices, apartments and garages, to be completed in 2013­2014; and
· a number of notable public sector projects currently in progress, including the installation of electrical

<<<

, heating and plumbing, HVAC, and sprinkler and fire alarm systems for Norra Länken, Sweden's largest ongoing road construction project, which is scheduled to open in 2015.
Tender Process and Pricing
We obtain projects through competitive bidding

<<<

. The process for obtaining business differs with respect to installation projects, on the one hand, and services assignments, on the other hand. The tender process for installation projects typically involves substantial preparation work, calculations

<<<

, planning and negotiations with the potential customer. Depending on the size of the potential project, a tender process can last from a few days to more than a year.
By contrast, our services projects are typically based on framework agreements

<<<

. During the tender process for services assignments, we work with the customer to detail items such as price, current organization, experience and availability. We are then usually appointed based on a weighted average of these items. Prior

<<<

 involvement usually offers competitive advantages.
Pricing for installation and services projects takes place at the local branch level, but pricing decisions are established at the group level. Factors that we typically take into account when

<<<

 pricing installation projects and services assignments may include: (i) the purchase price of materials; (ii) wages and hourly billing of project managers and employees; (iii) subcontractor costs; (iv) price differentiation for volume, geography

<<<

 or competence; (v) the fixed price of subscription agreements (in the service sector); and/or (vi) pricing adjustments relating to the economic cycle and general pricing adjustments.
Historically our customers have invited separate tenders

<<<

 for all electrical, heating and plumbing, and HVAC projects. Building services providers are engaged at a later stage of a project after the commencement of construction and the appointment of a lead contractor. As a result, pricing traditionally

<<<

 has been the primary competitive advantage of installation providers. However, we believe that the market has shown an apparent shift towards taking qualitative factors, such as integrated, energyefficient proposals and customer adaptations

<<<

, into account. In our experience, an increasing number of construction firms have recently chosen to procure integrated solutions for all electrical, heating and plumbing, and HVAC installations directly from one provider, rather than through

<<<

 a construction firm that may employ several subcontractors, in order to achieve significant cost and performance synergies. This development has contributed to support our growth.
Customer Contracts and Framework Agreements
The terms of our

<<<

 customer contracts vary widely by customer segment and jurisdiction due to differing customer requirements and applicable industry standards. In Sweden, Norway and Denmark, the industry has established generally acknowledged and accepted industry

<<<

 standard contracts. Such standard contracts are available for a variety of different building, construction, installation and contracting situations.
· Sweden. In Sweden, our customer agreements in the installation business area consist primarily

<<<

 of construction contracts in which the purchaser is responsible for the overall project and the design and we are responsible for only the installation. Where the purchaser remains responsible for design of a project, we act as subcontractor

<<<

 and enter into standard subcontracting arrangements. By contrast, in "turnkey" projects where we act as a main contractor with principal responsibility for the design and execution of a project, our contracts will contain general terms that

<<<

 will allocate different responsibilities between us and the customer. Customer agreements in the Swedish services business area include individual services agreements for a fixed period, long-term framework agreements (with or without agreed

<<<

 volumes) and oral agreements (in daily operations).
· Norway. We utilize four standard-form customer contracts for installation projects in Norway, which are based upon industry standards for construction in the country. As in Sweden, these

<<<

 contracts vary depending on whether the purchaser or contractor is responsible for the overall project and design and on whether we are acting as a contractor or a subcontractor. We also have a standard framework agreement used for our services

<<<

 contracts in Norway.
· Denmark. In Denmark, installation contracts are similarly based on standardized agreements with standard terms and conditions that follow generally accepted industry terms and conditions. Services agreements cover the

<<<

 operation or maintenance of installations in technical systems, properties and infrastructure as well as ordinary services agreements, often for a fixed period of time. Some services agreements are made as framework
91

agreements in which

<<<

 standard terms and conditions are used, and other services agreements are very short and are not based on standard forms.
We also typically provide to our customers guarantee and support service coverage. A standard guarantee period for customer

<<<

 agreements for installation projects is five years on materials and workmanship from the date of acceptance and approval by the customer. Where applicable, the parties may sometimes agree on longer guarantee periods for special equipment. We

<<<

 often negotiate extension clauses in our supply agreements that provide a warranty period of up to 66 months (i.e., five and one-half years) where a purchase is made for an installation project. This ensures adequate back-to-back coverage during

<<<

 the standard warranty period.
Order Intake and Order Backlog
We measure our order backlog by geographic division as of a single date by calculating the anticipated revenues from signed and binding contractual commitments existing on that date

<<<

 less amounts invoiced on those commitments up to that date. We have experienced a steady year-on-year increase in order intake and order backlog in most of our divisions as a result of an increase in the frequency of higher-profile and more

<<<

-complex installation projects. Our order backlog grew by approximately 5% to SEK4,809 million from December 31, 2011 to December 31, 2012, primarily due to the number of large installation orders that we obtained during this period.
The Sweden

<<<

­North division and the Stockholm division had order backlogs of SEK791 million and SEK1,303 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2012, which represented 40% and 61%, respectively, of our net sales for this division for the year ended December

<<<

 31, 2012. In the Stockholm division and the Sweden­North division, our strong order backlog has been driven primarily by our contract to carry out the second phase of installations at Facebook Inc.'s new data center in Luleå in northern Sweden

<<<

, which we are currently in the process of completing. The new contract award was primarily responsible for a 33% year-on-year increase in order backlog in 2011 in both divisions. In addition, in 2011 the Stockholm division expanded our existing

<<<

 installation contract for Norra Länken, Sweden's largest ongoing road construction project, to cover fire extinguishing systems in addition to HVAC systems and also was awarded the installation contract for Quality Hotel Arena Solna. The Stockholm

<<<

 division also received a contract to install the HVAC system for the new Stockholm Arena that is being built next to the Stockholm Globe Arena and has been given full responsibility for all installations in the new shopping center in the Hornstull

<<<

 district of Södermalm in Stockholm. In 2012, the completion of our installation project for Facebook, Inc.'s data center in Luleå led to a fall in order backlog for Sweden­North as of December 31, 2012 as compared to the previous year. Our

<<<

 2012 order backlog for the Stockholm division grew as a result of new contracts to install HVAC systems and systems across all fields of technology for, respectively, The New Karolinska Solna University Hospital and Stockholm's new post terminal

<<<

.
The Sweden­South division had an order backlog of SEK1,262 million as of December 31, 2012, which represented 39% of our net sales for this division for the year ended December 31, 2012. While our order backlog decreased year-on-year in the

<<<

 Sweden­South division in 2011, this was primarily the result of several large contract awards in 2010, including a project to carry out all installations in a new remand center in Helsingborg, all installations for the conversion of an old

<<<

 post office building in Gothenburg into the 36,000 square meter Clarion Hotel Post, heating and plumbing and HVAC installations in the new Emporia shopping center in Malmö and the services assignment at the largest nuclear power plant in the

<<<

 Nordic region, Ringhals. Our 2012 order backlog for Sweden­South fell slightly as a result of the completion of the Emporia shopping center in Malmö and the completion of the Clarion Hotel Post in Gothenburg. The fall in order backlog as a

<<<

 result of these project completions was partially offset by a new contract to install electrical, heating and plumbing and HVAC systems at the new Ängladården arena in Gothenburg.
The Norway division and the Denmark division had respective

<<<

 order backlogs of SEK939 million and SEK514 million as of December 31, 2012, which represented 35% of our net sales for the Norway division and 37% of our net sales for the Denmark division for the year ended December 31, 2012. The Norway division

<<<

 and the Denmark division showed weaker order backlog growth in 2010 and 2011, generally attributable to a shift toward increased services projects. Both divisions experienced an increase in order backlog from December 31, 2011 to December 

<<<

31, 2012 as a result of several large hospital projects being awarded to us in each division during the period.
Sales and Marketing Strategy
Our sales and marketing strategy reflects the local nature of the market for installation and services

<<<

. Generally, our sales and marketing activities are carried out by each branch in coordination with its respective regional and divisional offices, instead of through a central sales organization. Branch managers report to our marketing managers

<<<

 at each of the five divisions and seek to maintain working relationships with local branches of construction companies, municipal authorities and local industries to solidify recurring sales. Contracts with a value exceeding SEK50 million require

<<<

 the approval of our chief executive officer.
We typically seek to enter projects at an early stage in order to better understand customers' needs and identify opportunities for assuming greater responsibility. In addition, in connection with

<<<

 any installation project, customers are also often offered a services agreement to lock in going-forward sales. Prior to the completion of any project or assignment, we conduct an end meeting with the customer to evaluate any potential developments

<<<

 and areas in which we can continue to provide our services to the customer.
92

We undertake quarterly reviews of our existing and potential customer base to develop customer action plans that provide us greater insight into whether customers

<<<

 are growing and profitable, the mix of installation projects and/or services assignments that customers may undertake, customers' reputation and prior work relationships with customers. We then utilize this action plan as a guide for future

<<<

 marketing activities and to set target turnover and contribution margins.
Supply and Procurement
Our purchasing organization ensures that our customers have access to a competitive range of high-quality products. Consistent with our objective

<<<

 of providing our customers with competitive prices, we seek to continuously decrease our total cost of materials while increasing our competitiveness with new suppliers, new purchasing channels and new products or solutions. To that end, we

<<<

 have standardized our procurement processes and continually leverage economies of scale to ensure competitive pricing.
In addition, we are not dependent on any single supplier. In 2012, we had approximately 15,000 direct and indirect suppliers

<<<

 providing a range of products, including direct materials, such as piping, electrical and HVAC materials, and indirect materials such as vehicle financing. For the year ended December 31, 2012, we estimate that our top ten suppliers accounted

<<<

 for 32% of our total supply costs, while our top 250 suppliers accounted for approximately 80% of our total supply costs.
Human Resources and Personnel
Employees
As of March 31, 2013 we had 7,868 employees located throughout Sweden, Norway

<<<

 and Denmark. The average number of employees for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was 8,139, 7,955 and 7,834, respectively. Our employees are divided between group, divisional, regional and branch level, with the vast majority

<<<

 being employed at branch level. We also employed over 6,000 installers and technicians (including electricians, plumbers, fitters and engineers) as of December 31, 2012. When a particular project requires skills outside our technical fields

<<<

, we employed subcontractors.
Recruitment and Development
The building services industry in Scandinavia has demonstrated a trend towards growth in the long term and technological advances will require more highly skilled employees. In particular

<<<

, project managers will need stronger technical and commercial expertise. In addition, our decentralized management structure requires us to ensure a high level of competence among our employees. As a result, we seek to attract younger employees

<<<

 with high levels of education. We have expanded our activities at universities in order to attract more engineers to the group, in particular by offering competitive compensation levels in each local market, and aim to recruit staff internally

<<<

 by offering opportunities for further career development.
In addition, we have implemented a central leadership development program in order to identify and train current and future managers. The program is carried out by management in collaboration

<<<

 with our local branches, which are encouraged to draw up succession plans as well as to identify and coach new managers. Since 2007, over half of our managers have initiated or completed the course, which runs over 18 months and culminates

<<<

 in the award of an internal diploma. In addition, in 2010 we established the Bravida School, which offers specialist training courses in areas such as project management, the group's common ERP system and occupational health and safety. In

<<<

 2011 more than 1,100 employees took part in the courses.
We also have implemented simple but effective incentive schemes focused on profitability improvement, to create local ownership and increase our attractiveness as an employer. For example

<<<

, branch managers can earn discretionary compensation related to profits and based on certain profitability thresholds, after social costs and benefits are deducted.
Labor Relations and Pension Issues
Our employees are covered by either a defined

<<<

 contribution pension plan or a benefit pension plan. For more information, see "Risk Factors--Risks Related to Our Business and Industry--We may be required to make further contributions to our pension schemes if the value of pension fund assets

<<<

 is not sufficient to cover potential obligations."
We are bound by various collective bargaining agreements in each of the countries in which we operate. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Facilities and Leases
In addition

<<<

 to our headquarters in Stockholm, Sweden, we have five operating divisions divided geographically into 26 regions, with each division comprised of between four and six regions. Each region has a number of locations that may be comprised of

<<<

 one or more branches, each specializing in one field of technology. We maintained approximately 200 branches as of March 31, 2013, the largest of which accounted for less than 3% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2012.
Our group

<<<

 management is located at our headquarters in Stockholm and activities performed at this level include overhead and support functions such as purchasing, process development, information technology, communications, human resources and performance

<<<

 management, legal affairs, and accounting and finance. With respect to our five operating divisions,
93

activities performed are primarily overhead functions such as financial control, legal, competence centers, national negotiations and

<<<

 staff functions, and coordinating and following up on strategies and goals set at the group management level.
In addition to our head office in Stockholm, Sweden, our facilities comprise primarily branch offices for local operations. We lease

<<<

 approximately 150 premises in Sweden, Norway and Denmark as well as parking and garage spaces. Leasing costs related to these premises and spaces amounted to SEK148 million and represented approximately 1.3% of net sales for the year ended

<<<

 December 31, 2012. Our leasing costs for the year ended December 31, 2012 represented SEK148 million for office rent and SEK191.3 million for other costs and expenses such as vehicles, office equipment, information technology and other equipment

<<<

. We believe that our properties are generally adequate for our present needs and that suitable additional or replacement space will be available when needed.
Health and Safety
Our operations are subject to various health and safety laws in

<<<

 the jurisdictions in which we operate that require us to comply with various security measures and to implement discrete policies.
In the last three years, we have experienced one serious work-related accident that resulted in the death of

<<<

 an employee. In 2011, we introduced a target of zero workplace accidents in our operations.
We have adopted a uniform work environment policy at the group level, which is complemented by a electrical safety policy. The primary aim of these

<<<

 policies is to ensure that employees have the right competence and experience to carry out their assignments, that a good work environment, with a minimum of incidents, is maintained and that electrical work is performed by designated professionals

<<<

 and fulfill the requirements on electrical safety.
Information Technology
Our information technology operations and network services are mainly outsourced to external providers through outsourcing agreements. We have one provider for basic

<<<

 information technology services, such as server monitoring and maintenance, whereas our wide area network and internet communication are outsourced to a separate provider. Our information technology systems are primarily based around the common

<<<

 ERP system, Agresso, which, together with our feeding systems, is a complete business system that maintains all of our commercial processes, including time registry, procurement, invoicing, billing, accounting, financial monitoring and reporting

<<<

. Agresso allows for detailed cost allocation during the appraisal phase of projects and is highly adaptable, making it possible to integrate a medium-sized branch--newly established or recently acquired--within less than three months.
Employees

<<<

 are able to enter their online workplace from any location and easily access different registers containing data such as client information and history, experience from previous assignments, key ratios for tender proposals and resource availability

<<<

. The information technology environment is designed to be easily adaptable to meet the needs of different organizational structures and operations, and the common technology platform is scalable and modular. It consists of basic modules for

<<<

 operations control, quality assurance, mandatory regulations and central functions.
We have security measures in place regarding the personal data of our employees and customers, which take into account relevant employment laws and personal

<<<

 data legislation in Sweden, Norway and Denmark. We do not transfer personal data outside the EEA without observing legal obligations applicable to such transfers.
Insurance
Our group-wide insurance coverage includes policies for risks associated

<<<

 with our business, including general liability, contract and property, directors' and officers' liability, as well as automobile, buildings and contents and workers' compensation policies. Our key insurance underwriters include Moderna Försäkringar

<<<

 AB and Zurich Insurance Group Ltd. We believe that our insurance coverage is consistent with industry standards.
Litigation
We provide a complex range of services to a large number of customers. As such, in the ordinary course of business,

<<<

 we are subject to various administrative, legal and/or regulatory proceedings. On the basis of current information, we do not expect that the actual claims, lawsuits and other proceedings to which we are subject, or potential claims, lawsuits

<<<

 and other proceedings relating to matters of which we are aware, will ultimately have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. We note, however, that the outcome of legal proceedings is extremely

<<<

 difficult to predict with certainty, and we offer no assurance in this regard. The most significant actual or potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings of which we are currently aware are described below.
Thule Air Base Litigation (Denmark

<<<

)
Our subsidiary, Bravida Danmark A/S ("Bravida Danmark"), was a member of the Danish Construction Company ("DCC"), which is a consortium of five construction companies. DCC is party to a claim brought before the U.S. Department of Labor, Office

<<<

 of Administrative Law Judges in New York City under the Defense Base Act by four former employees of DCC. A former member of the DCC consortium, E.Pihl & Søn AS, is defending the claim on behalf of DCC. The case concerns an
94

American bomber

<<<

 aircraft that crashed near the Thule air base in Greenland in January 1968, the construction site where the plaintiffs were working at the time of the accident. The aircraft was carrying nuclear weapons at the time of the accident and the plaintiffs

<<<

 have alleged that they suffered severe illness as a result of exposure to radioactive discharge resulting from the accident. Two of the four former employees are deceased from cancer and are represented by their families.
Between 1985 and 

<<<

1990, the accident resulted in a number of legal proceedings in the United States and Denmark. In the United States these cases were dismissed and in Denmark the Danish government paid compensation of DKK50,000 to each of the employees at the

<<<

 air base. The plaintiffs have not yet quantified their claim and, as a result, we are not presently able to determine the magnitude and extent of the claim. If the DCC were to be held liable and ordered to pay damages, there is at present no

<<<

 agreement on how the damages will be distributed among the former members of the consortium. We are in discussion with DCC regarding the potential allocation of any liability that may result from this case. We believe that we may be able to

<<<

 claim partial indemnification from Semco Maritime A/S that was part of the Bravida Danmark's group prior to its demerger in 1990 should we be held jointly or severally liable.
Danmarks Radio Claim (Denmark)
Between 2004 and 2008, Bravida Danmark

<<<

 was engaged to perform certain installation works at the headquarters of the Danish Broadcasting Corporation (Danmarks Radio). Bravida Danmark had been commissioned to install the indoor climate system at the headquarters of Danmarks Radio

<<<

 in accordance with specifications from third-party architects and consultants independently engaged by Danmarks Radio. Following the completion of the construction of the headquarters in 2008, Danmarks Radio alleged that they had experienced

<<<

 certain problems with the indoor climate at their headquarters due to, what they alleged were, faults related to the design and installation of the indoor climate system and components.
In 2009, Danmarks Radio initiated preliminary proceedings

<<<

 with the Danish Board of Arbitration for Building and Construction (Voldgiftsnævnet for Bygge og Anlægsvirksomhed) ("Board of Arbitration") to have experts appointed to determine and opine on the facts of the matter. In October 2010, Bravida

<<<

 Danmark and certain other parties involved in the construction of the headquarters received notice that Danmarks Radio had allegedly incurred costs in the amount of DKK60.1 million (not including value-added tax) as a result of faults with

<<<

 the indoor climate system and components and that Danmarks Radio intended to assert a claim against Bravida Danmark and certain other third parties for indemnification. In October 2012, Danmarks Radio submitted a complaint to the Board of Arbitration

<<<

 against Bravida Danmark and Danmarks Radio's project management liability insurer claiming damages in the amount of DKK30 million. Danmarks Radio later withdrew its complaint conditioned upon Bravida Danmark consenting to waive the applicable

<<<

 statutory limitation period until the end of 2013. The experts appointed by the Board of Arbitration provided their first opinion in the summer of 2012 following which Danmarks Radio requested a supplementary opinion from them. Based on the

<<<

 findings of the panel of experts, Danmarks Radio may initiate proceedings with the Board of Arbitration. At present, however, no writ of summons or complaint has been filed with the Board of Arbitration by Danmarks Radio. We believe that costs

<<<

 incurred by Danmarks Radio are attributable to the design of the indoor climate system and not to any defect in Bravida Danmark's performance of its obligations under the contract with Danmarks Radio and as such have not made any reservation

<<<

 for this claim in our financial statements.
NCC Construction Claim (Norway)
In 2012, we were engaged as a subcontractor by NCC Construction ("NCC"), to provide electronic installation services in connection with the construction of the Comfort

<<<

 Hotel Grand Central (Østbanehotellet) in Oslo, Norway, with the original proposed completion date of April 30, 2012. Subsequently, proposed project modifications made it difficult for us to meet the April 30, 2012 completion deadline. After

<<<

 notifying NCC of the likelihood of a delay, NCC formally requested us to accelerate our construction work, causing us to incur additional costs in the amount of NOK7.7 million (not including VAT), of which we have received only NOK1.5 million

<<<

 till date. We currently hold a claim against NCC in an aggregate amount of NOK6.6 million (not including value-added tax). We have made a provision of NOK4.0 million to cover a loss in the event that we are not successful in receiving a full

<<<

 settlement of our claim.
Sevan Marine­AS Nymo Claim (Norway)
Between 2010 and 2012, we were engaged as a subcontractor to AS Nymo to perform electrical, instrument, telecommunications and pipe maintenance works on the "Sevan Voyageur," a floating

<<<

 production storage and offloading unit operated by Sevan Marine in the offshore oil and gas industry. Our payment from AS Nymo under the subcontracting arrangement was dependent on AS Nymo's receipt of payment from Sevan Marine. Currently,

<<<

 we have an outstanding receivable owing from AS Nymo of approximately NOK27.7 million (not including value-added tax), NOK22.1 million of which we have accounted for as revenue. AS Nymo has commenced proceedings against Sevan Marine on account

<<<

 of amounts owed, including amounts owed to us as subcontractor. We have made a provision in the amount of NOK10.0 million to cover a loss in the event that we are not successful in obtaining a full settlement of our claim.

 principles accede as a Guarantor within 90 days of delivery of such annual financial statements for the relevant financial year (commencing with the financial year ending December 31, 2013) demonstrating that it has become a material company

<<<

 and shall grant transaction security over its material assets.
If at the end of each financial year (commencing with the financial year ending December 31, 2013) the Guarantors represent less than 85% of the consolidated EBITDA of the group

<<<

 or less than 85% of aggregate turnover of the group (subject to certain exceptions) (the "Guarantor and Security Coverage Test"), the Issuer shall ensure that within 90 days of the delivery of the annual audited consolidated financial statements

<<<

 for the relevant financial year such other members of the restricted group (as the Issuer may elect in its sole discretion) shall (subject to certain agreed security principles) (i) accede as Guarantors to ensure that the Guarantor and Security

<<<

 Coverage Test are satisfied (calculated as if such additional guarantors had been Guarantors at the end of such financial year) and (ii) grant security over its material assets.
Security
The initial security provided for the Revolving Credit

<<<

 Facility is described under the heading "Description of the Senior Secured Notes--Security."
Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral (whether or not shared with the holders of the Notes

<<<

) will be required to be applied to repay indebtedness outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility in priority to the Notes.
Representations and Warranties
The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain customary representations

<<<

 and warranties, subject to certain customary materiality, actual knowledge and other qualifications, exceptions and baskets, and with certain representations and warranties being repeated, including: (i) status and incorporation; (ii) binding

<<<

, all of which are subject to customary materiality, actual knowledge and other qualifications, exceptions and baskets.
Notes Purchase Condition
The Revolving Credit Facility requires that if more than 60% of the face value of the Notes and

<<<

 any other note indebtedness are repurchased prior to their scheduled repayment date, the Revolving Credit Facility will be permanently cancelled and repaid on a matching pro rata basis until the Revolving Credit Facility has been reduced to

<<<

102

Affirmative Covenants
The affirmative covenants include, among others: (i) providing certain

-group; and (v) compliance with the regulations set forth by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. The negative covenants in the Revolving Credit Facility are, in all other respects, substantially similar to the negative covenants in the Indenture

<<<

.
Mandatory Prepayment Requirements upon a Change of Control or a Sale
Upon a Change of Control or a Sale (each as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) the facilities under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will be cancelled

<<<

 and all outstanding utilizations and all outstanding amounts under any ancillary facility, together with accrued interest, and all other amounts accrued under the Finance Documents (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) shall

<<<

 become immediately due and payable and shall be repaid within three business days of such date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, an ancillary lender or, as the case may be, the Issuing Bank (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement

<<<

) may, as between itself and the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, agree to continue to provide such ancillary facility or, as the case may be, letters of credit, in which case, after notification thereof to the Agent such arrangements shall continue

<<<

 on a bilateral basis and not as part of, or under, the Finance Documents and save for any rights and obligations against any other finance party under the Finance Documents arising prior to such cancellation, no such rights or obligations in

<<<

 respect of the letters of credit or, as the case may be, ancillary facility shall, as between the Finance Parties, continue and the transaction security shall not, following the release thereof by the Security Agent, secure any such letters

<<<

 of credit or ancillary facility in respect of any claims that arise after such cancellation.
Financial Covenant
Under the Revolving Credit Facility, we are required to comply with a Super Senior Leverage ratio (as defined in the Revolving Credit

<<<

 Facility and based on the ratio of consolidated total drawn super-senior facilities debt under the Revolving Credit Facility to consolidated EBITDA for the relevant twelve-month period) which must not exceed 2.5:1. The financial covenant will

<<<

 be calculated and tested on December 31, 2013 and quarterly thereafter (if any amount is outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility on the last day of the relevant period), in each case, on a rolling twelve-month basis by reference to

<<<

 our consolidated annual financial statements and our consolidated quarterly financial statements.
Events of Default
The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides for the same events of default (with certain adjustments as necessary) as under

<<<

 the Notes.
In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility provides for customary events of default, all of which are subject to customary materiality, actual knowledge and other qualifications, exceptions, baskets and/or grace periods, as appropriate

<<<

, including: (i) breach of financial covenant (subject to certain equity cure rights); (ii) representations or warranties found to be untrue or misleading when made or deemed repeated subject to a 15-business day grace period; (iii) cross-default

<<<

; (iv) repudiation and rescission; (v) unlawfulness and invalidity; (vi) any failure to comply with a material term of, or breach of representation or warranty under, the Intercreditor Agreement; and (viii) cessation of business.
Governing Law

<<<


The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and any non-contractual obligation arising out of or in connection with it is governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with English law although the restrictive covenants, which are included

<<<

 in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, will be interpreted in accordance with New York law (without prejudice to the fact that the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement is governed by, and shall be governed by English law).
Hedging Obligations

<<<


The Issuer is party to certain interest rate and cross currency hedging arrangements to mitigate against its interest rate exposures under its Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes and cross currency exposures under its EUR Senior Secured Floating

<<<

 Rate Notes.
103

The Issuer currently intends to hedge at least 66% of the notional amount of its Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes for interest rate exposure and 75% of the notional amount of its EUR Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes for

<<<

 cross-currency exposure, in each case for a period of at least three years from the Issue Date.

Intercreditor Agreement

In connection with entering into the Revolving Credit Facility and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Issuer, the

<<<

 Guarantors and certain other subsidiaries of the Issuer have entered into the Intercreditor Agreement to govern the relationships and relative priorities among: (i) the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility (the "RCF Lenders"); (ii) any

<<<

 persons that accede to the Intercreditor Agreement as counterparties to certain hedging agreements (collectively, the "Hedging Agreements," the liabilities under such Hedging Agreements, the "Hedging Liabilities" and any persons that accede

<<<

 to the Intercreditor Agreement as counterparties to the Hedging Agreements are referred to in such capacity as the "Hedge Counterparties"); (iii) the Senior Secured Notes Trustee, on its own behalf and on behalf of the holders of the Senior

<<<

 Secured Notes (the "Senior Secured Noteholders"); (v) intra-group lenders and borrowers; and (vi) the direct or indirect shareholder of the Issuer in respect of any structural debt that the Issuer has or may incur in the future (including shareholder

<<<

 loans). In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement regulates the relationship between (A) the Issuer and the other creditors of Pari Passu Debt and/or Second Lien Debt and between (B) the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, on the one hand

<<<

, and shareholders of the Issuer and related parties, on the other hand.

The Issuer and each of its Restricted Subsidiaries that incurs any liability or provides any guarantee under the Revolving Credit Facility or the Senior Secured Notes

<<<

 Indenture are each referred to in this description as a "Debtor" and are referred to collectively as the "Debtors."

In this description "Group" refers to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

The Intercreditor Agreement sets forth:

<<<



(a)

the relative ranking of certain indebtedness of the Debtors;

(b)

the relative ranking of certain security granted by the Debtors;

(c)

when payments can be made in respect of certain indebtedness of the Debtors;

(d)

when enforcement

<<<

 actions can be taken in respect of that indebtedness;

(e)

the terms pursuant to which that indebtedness will be subordinated upon the occurrence of certain

insolvency events;

(f)

turnover provisions; and

(g)

when security and guarantees

<<<

 will be released to permit a sale of any assets subject to transaction security

(such assets, the "Collateral"; such security, the "Transaction Security;" and the documents constituting

such Transaction Security, the "Transaction Security

<<<

 Documents").

The Intercreditor Agreement contains provisions relating to future indebtedness that may be incurred by the members of the Group, which is permitted or not prohibited under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Senior Secured Notes

<<<

 Indenture, any existing Pari Passu Debt Document (as defined below) and any existing Second Lien Debt Document (as defined below) or with the consent of the relevant Creditor Representatives (as defined below) under each document (acting on

<<<

 the instructions of the requisite level of creditors under such documents) to rank pari passu in right of payment with the liabilities under the Revolving Credit Facility, the liabilities under the Senior Secured Notes and any existing Pari

<<<

 Passu Liabilities and to be secured on the Collateral, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (such indebtedness being the "Pari Passu Debt," the creditors in respect of such indebtedness being the "Pari Passu Creditors," the liabilities

<<<

 of the Debtors in respect of such indebtedness being the "Pari Passu Liabilities" and the documents creating or evidencing the Pari Passu Liabilities, the "Pari Passu Debt Documents"), provided that the Pari Passu Creditors (or their Pari Passu

<<<

 Debt Representative) have acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with its terms (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, Credit Facility Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities and Second Lien Liabilities).

The Intercreditor

<<<

 Agreement also includes provisions relating to future indebtedness that may be incurred by the members of the Group which is permitted or not prohibited under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, any existing Pari

<<<

 Passu Debt Document (as defined below) and any existing Second Lien Debt Documents (as defined below) or with the consent of the relevant Creditor Representatives (as defined below) under each document (acting on the instructions of the requisite

<<<

 level of creditors under such documents) to share in the Transaction Security with the rights and obligations of Second Lien Creditors (as defined below), subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (such indebtedness being the "Second

<<<

 Lien Debt," the creditors in respect of such indebtedness being the "Second Lien Creditors." the liabilities of the Debtors in respect of such indebtedness being the "Second Lien Liabilities" and the documents creating or evidencing the Second

<<<

 Lien Liabilities, the "Second Lien Debt Documents"), provided that the Second Lien Creditors (or their Second Lien Debt Representative) have acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with its terms (excluding, for the avoidance of

<<<

 doubt, Credit Facility Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities and Pari Passu Liabilities). The Intercreditor Agreement

104

includes customary provisions in respect of the rights and obligations of, and restrictions placed upon

<<<

, Second Lien Creditors; including in relation to (i) the circumstances in which payments in respect of Second Lien Debt are permitted to be made (ii) the circumstances when payments under the Second Lien Debt can be suspended (including through

<<<

 the issuance of a stop notice (and cure provisions in respect thereof)), (iii) restrictions on when the Second Lien Creditors can and cannot take enforcement actions (including customary standstill provisions in respect of Second Lien Debt

<<<

) and (v) the ability of Second Lien Creditors to purchase the Super Senior Liabilities and the Senior Secured Debt in certain circumstances. We urge you to read the document to understand the rights of holders of the Notes and the rights of

<<<

, and the restrictions placed upon, the Second Lien Creditors.

No Second Lien Debt had been incurred by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries on the Issue Date. As set forth in "--Ranking and Priority" below, any future Second Lien Debt

<<<

 incurred by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries will be fully subordinated to the Revolving Credit Facility, the Senior Secured Notes and any existing Pari Passu Debt.

The Intercreditor Agreement also provides for any credit facility

<<<

 constituting a "Credit Facility" under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the creditors of which are entitled under the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, any existing Pari Passu Debt Document and any existing Second Lien Debt Document

<<<

 to receive priority in respect of proceeds of the enforcement against the Collateral (each such facility being a "Credit Facility" and, together with the Revolving Credit Facility, the "Credit Facilities" and each finance document relating

<<<

 thereto, a "Credit Facility Document"). Each lender under a Credit Facility is a "Credit Facility Lender" and the liabilities of the Debtors to the Credit Facility Lenders are referred to as the "Credit Facility Lender Liabilities."

Unless

<<<

 expressly stated otherwise in the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event of a conflict between the terms of any Credit Facility, Senior Secured Notes Indenture, any Pari Passu Debt Document or any Pari Passu Debt Document and the Intercreditor

<<<

 Agreement, the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement will prevail.

By purchasing a Note, holders of the Notes shall be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted the terms and conditions of, the Intercreditor Agreement and to have authorized

<<<

 and directed the Senior Secured Notes Trustee and Security Agent to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement on their behalf.

The following description is a summary of certain provisions, among others, contained in the Intercreditor Agreement

<<<

. It does not restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety, and we urge you to read that document because it, and not the description that follows, defines the rights of holders of the Notes.

Ranking and Priority

The Intercreditor Agreement

<<<

 provides, subject to the provisions in respect of permitted payments described below, that (i) the Credit Facility Lender Liabilities, (ii) the liabilities of the Debtors with respect to hedging agreements entered into in relation to interest

<<<

 rate exposures or currency exposures in respect of (x) any Credit Facility, the Senior Secured Notes or (y) in respect of Pari Passu Debt or any indebtedness ranking pari passu with any of them or any indebtedness referred to in (x) above the

<<<

 incurrence of which is permitted or not prohibited under any Credit Facility, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, any Pari Passu Debt Documents and any Second Lien Debt Document (the "Super Senior Hedging Liabilities" and, together with the

<<<

 Credit Facility Lender Liabilities and any amounts owed to the Security Agent, the "Super Senior Liabilities" and the creditors of the Super Senior Liabilities, the "Super Senior Creditors"), (iii) the liabilities of the Senior Secured Notes

<<<

 Issuer and the Debtors in respect of the Senior Secured Notes (the "Senior Secured Notes Liabilities"), (iv) the Pari Passu Liabilities, (v) the liabilities of the Debtors with respect to the hedging agreements in respect of (1) any Second

<<<

 Lien Debt or (2) any hedging arrangements described in (ii) above which are not designated as Super Senior Hedging Liabilities together with any operational hedging which is permitted or not prohibited under any Credit Facility, the Senior

<<<

 Secured Notes Indenture, any Pari Passu Debt Documents and any Second Lien Debt Document (the "Non-Super Senior Hedging Liabilities"), (and the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, the Pari Passu Liabilities and the Non-Super Senior Hedging Liabilities

<<<

, together, the "Senior Secured Liabilities" and the creditors of the Senior Secured Liabilities, the "Senior Secured Creditors"), (vi) the liabilities of the Debtors to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee (the "Note Trustee Amounts"), (vii) the

<<<

 Second Lien Liabilities and (viii) certain other unsecured liabilities will rank in right and priority of payment in the following order:

(a)

first, the Super Senior Liabilities and the Senior Secured Liabilities pari passu and without any

<<<

 preference

between them;

(b)

second, the Second Lien Liabilities pari passu and without any preference between them

(c)

third, certain intercompany obligations of members of the Group (each an "Intra-Group Lender" and

collectively the

<<<

 "Intra-Group Lenders") and such liabilities being referred to in this description as the

"Intra-Group Liabilities") pari passu and without any preference between them; and

(d)

fourth, liabilities in respect of investor debt owed by any Debtor

<<<

 to any direct or indirect shareholder (or

affiliate who is not a member of the Group) of the Issuer (and any of their respective transferees or

successors) pari passu between themselves and without any preference between them.

In this section

<<<

 any liabilities owed by any Debtor to any shareholder, direct or indirect, of the Issuer are referred to as "Shareholder Liabilities" and together with the Intra-Group Liabilities, the "Subordinated Liabilities."
105

The parties to the Intercreditor

<<<

 Agreement have agreed in the Intercreditor Agreement that the Transaction Security provided by the Debtors and the other parties in respect of the Super Senior Liabilities, the Senior Secured Liabilities, the Second Lien Liabilities and any

<<<

 amounts owing to the Security Agent (together, the "Secured Liabilities") ranks and secures such liabilities, in the following order:

(a)

first, the Super Senior Liabilities, the Senior Secured Liabilities pari passu and without any preference

<<<



between them, and

(b)

second, the Second Lien Liabilities pari passu and without any preference between them;

in each case irrespective of:

(i)

the order of execution, creation, registration, notice, enforcement or otherwise;

(ii)

the

<<<

 date on which any Liability arose; and

(iii)

any fluctuation in the amount, or any intermediate discharge in whole or in part, of any

Liability.

Under the Intercreditor Agreement, all proceeds from enforcement of the Transaction Security

<<<

 will be applied as provided under "--Limitation on Enforcement of Intra-Group Liabilities-- Application of Proceeds."

The creditors in respect of the Super Senior Liabilities, the Senior Secured Liabilities and the Second Lien Liabilities

<<<

 (the Super Senior Liabilities, the Senior Secured Liabilities and the Second Lien Liabilities, together, the "Secured Liabilities," and the creditors thereof, the "Secured Parties" and the documents evidencing the Secured Liabilities, the 

<<<

"Secured Debt Documents") may take, accept or receive the benefit of additional security and additional guarantees, indemnities or other assurance against loss from any member of the Group in respect of the Secured Liabilities, provided that

<<<

, if and to the extent legally possible and subject to the agreed security principles, such security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss is also granted to the Security Agent as agent and trustee of the other Secured Parties

<<<

. Any such additional security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss will rank in the same order of priority as referred to above and the proceeds of the enforcement of any such security, guarantee, indemnity and/or other assurance

<<<

 against loss will be applied as provided under "-- Limitation on Enforcement of Intra-Group Liabilities--Application of Proceeds."

The Intercreditor Agreement contemplates the Debtors (or any of them): (i) incurring incremental borrowing liabilities

<<<

 and/or guarantee liabilities under; or (ii) refinancing (in whole or in part) the borrowing liabilities incurred under, the documents creating or evidencing indebtedness under or in respect of any Credit Facility, the Senior Secured Notes,

<<<

 the Second Lien Debt, the Hedging Liabilities, the Pari Passu Debt or the Subordinated Liabilities (such documents or instruments being referred to collectively as the "Debt Documents") and/or incurring guarantees in respect of any indebtedness

<<<

 incurred in connection with any such refinancing which may, without limitation, be in each case implemented in whole or in part by way of debt exchange, noncash rollover or other similar or equivalent transaction (such incremental borrowing

<<<

 liabilities, refinancing liabilities and/or guarantee liabilities being referred to as "Additional Indebtedness") which in any such case are intended to rank pari passu with and/or share pari passu in any Transaction Security with any existing

<<<

 liabilities and/or to rank behind any existing liabilities and/or to share in the Transaction Security behind such existing liabilities. The Secured Parties and the creditors in respect of the Subordinated Liabilities (the "Subordinated Creditors

<<<

") (each a "Creditor" and collectively, the "Creditors") will confirm in the Intercreditor Agreement that, provided such financing or refinancing and such ranking and such security is permitted or not prohibited under the terms of the Debt Documents

<<<

, they will (at the Debtors' cost) enter into such documentation as may be necessary (including amending the existing Intercreditor Agreement or entering into a new, additional or replacement intercreditor agreement on substantially the same

<<<

 terms as the Intercreditor Agreement) to ensure that the Additional Indebtedness (and the liabilities and obligations of the Debtors in respect of such Additional Indebtedness) will have the ranking permitted to be conferred upon it in accordance

<<<

 with the terms of the Debt Documents, provided that such documentation does not in any significant respect adversely affect the interests of any of the Secured Parties.

Security: Pari Passu Creditors

The Pari Passu Creditors may take, accept

<<<

 or receive the benefit of:

(a)

security in respect of the Pari Passu Liabilities in addition to the Transaction Security if, to the extent

legally possible and subject to the agreed security principles, at the same time, it is also granted

<<<

:

(i)

to the Security Agent as agent or as trustee for the other Secured Parties in respect of their

secured obligations;

(ii)

in the case of any jurisdiction in which effective security cannot be granted in favor of the

Security Agent

<<<

 as trustee for the Secured Parties:

(A)

to the other Secured Parties in respect of their secured obligations; or

106

(B)

to the Security Agent as agent or as trustee under a parallel debt structure, joint and

several creditor structure

<<<

 or agency structure for the benefit of the other Secured

Parties; or

(iii)

in the case of any security granted after the date of the Intercreditor Agreement, to some of the

Secured Parties provided that such security is incremental to the

<<<

 Transaction Security that has

already been granted in favor of all other Secured Parties and any proceeds derived from the

enforcement of such security will be shared with the Secured Parties in accordance with the

payment waterfalls set

<<<

 forth in "--Limitation on Enforcement of Intra-Group Liabilities--

Application of Proceeds."

and ranks in the same order of priority as that contemplated in "--Ranking and Priority"; and

(b)

any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against

<<<

 loss in respect of the Pari Passu Liabilities in addition

to those in:

(i)

the original form of the Pari Passu Debt Documents;

(ii)

the Intercreditor Agreement; or

(iii)

any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss given

<<<

 for the benefit of all the Secured

Parties in respect of their Secured Liabilities,

only if, in each case (A) the grant of such security or the giving of such guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss is permitted by or is not

<<<

 otherwise prohibited (or has otherwise been approved) under the documents or instruments creating or evidencing the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities (the "Senior Secured Notes Documents"), the Credit Facility Documents and the documents or

<<<

 instruments creating or evidencing the Second Lien Debt (the "Second Lien Debt Documents") and (B) at the same time, it is also granted to the Credit Facility Lenders and granted to the other Secured Parties in respect of their respective Secured

<<<

 Liabilities and ranks in the same order of priority as that contemplated in "--Ranking and Priority."

Permitted Payments of Subordinated Debt

The Intercreditor Agreement permits, inter alia, payments to be made by the Debtors under the Revolving

<<<

 Credit Facility and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Pari Passu Debt Documents and the Second Lien Debt Documents, in each case in accordance with the terms of the relevant Credit Facility Agreement, Senior Secured Notes Indenture

<<<

, Pari Passu Debt Document or Second Lien Debt Document, subject to (A) in the case of payments in respect of the Senior Secured Notes, compliance with the "Notes Purchase Condition"; (B) in the case of payments in respect of the Pari Passu

<<<

 Liabilities, any restrictions under the Credit Facilities or the Senior Secured Notes Indenture; and (C) in the case of payments in respect of the Second Lien Liabilities, subject to certain customary provisions governing permitted payments

<<<

 in respect of the Second Lien Debt and provided that following the occurrence of a nonpayment event of default under the Revolving Credit Facility or an acceleration event with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility or any other Credit Facility

<<<

, the Senior Secured Notes, Pari Passu Debt or Second Lien Debt, no member of the Group may make (and no Super Senior Creditor or Senior Secured Creditor may receive) payments of Credit Facility Lender Liabilities, Hedging Liabilities, Senior

<<<

 Secured Notes Liabilities, the Pari Passu Liabilities and Second Lien Liabilities except for recoveries distributed in accordance with the provisions set out under the caption "--Application of Proceeds".

The Intercreditor Agreement also permits

<<<

 payments to be made from time to time when due to lenders owed any IntraGroup Liabilities ("Intra-Group Liabilities Payments") if at the time of payment no acceleration event has occurred in respect of a Credit Facility, the Pari Passu Liabilities

<<<

, the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, the Second Lien Liabilities (an "Acceleration Event"). The Intercreditor Agreement permits Intra-Group Liabilities Payments if such an Acceleration Event has occurred if (i) prior to the date on which

<<<

 the Super Senior Liabilities are discharged (the "Super Senior Discharge Date"), with the consent of the Senior Secured Instructing Group (as defined below), (ii) after the Super Senior Discharge Date but prior to the date on which the Senior

<<<

 Secured Liabilities are discharged in full (the "Senior Secured Discharge Date"), with the consent of the Senior Secured Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders (being at any time, those Senior Secured Notes Required Holders and Pari Passu Debt Required

<<<

 Holders whose Senior Secured Credit Participations at that time aggregate more than 50% of the total Senior Secured Credit Participations at that time) (acting through their Creditor Representatives (as defined below)); (iii) after the Senior

<<<

 Secured Discharge Date but prior to the date on which the Second Lien Liabilities are discharged (the "Second Lien Discharge Date"), with the consent of the Second Lien Required Holders (as defined below) (acting through their Creditor Representatives

<<<

 (as defined below)); (iv) if that payment is made to facilitate payment of the Super Senior Liabilities or Senior Secured Liabilities; (v) if that payment is made to facilitate payment of Second Lien Debt that is permitted to be paid under

<<<

 the Intercreditor Agreement; or (vi) save in respect of any Intra-Group liabilities that are subject to Transaction Security governed by Swedish law, that action is taken to facilitate payment of the secured liabilities, Senior Secured Notes

<<<

 Trustee Amounts, the liabilities of Creditor Representatives or other amounts due and payable to the Security Agent.

Payments may be made on Shareholder Liabilities from time to time when due if: (i) the payment is permitted by or not prohibited

<<<

 (or has otherwise been approved) under a Credit Facility, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Pari Passu Debt Documents and the Second Lien Debt Documents; (ii) prior to the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Senior Secured Instructing Group

<<<

 gives written consent to such payment being made; (iii) after the Super Senior Discharge Date but prior to the
107

Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Senior Secured Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders (acting through their Creditor Representative

<<<

 (as defined below)) give written consent to such payment being made; or (iv) after the Senior Secured Discharge Date but prior to the Second Lien Debt Discharge Date, the Second Lien Required Holders (acting through their Creditor Representative

<<<

 (as defined below)) give written consent to such payment being made.

Creditor Representative

Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the parties appoint various creditor representatives.

"Creditor Representative" means:

(a)

in relation to the

<<<

 RCF Lenders, the facility agent under the Revolving Credit Facility (the "RCF Agent");

(b)

in relation to the Credit Facility Lenders under any other Credit Facility, the facility agent in respect of that

credit facility (an "Additional

<<<

 Credit Facility Agent," and, together with the RCF Agent, a "Credit Facility

Agent");

(c)

in relation to the Senior Secured Noteholders, the Senior Secured Notes Trustee;

(d)

in relation to any Pari Passu Creditors, the creditor representative

<<<

 for those Pari Passu Creditors (the "Pari

Passu Debt Representative");

(e)

in relation to any Second Lien Creditors, the creditor representative for those Second Lien Creditors (the

"Second Lien Debt Representative"); and

(f)

in relation

<<<

 to any Hedge Counterparty, such Hedge Counterparty (which shall be its own Creditor

Representative).

Entitlement to Enforce Transaction Security

The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security or taking any other enforcement

<<<

 action unless otherwise instructed by:

(a)

the relevant Senior Secured Instructing Group (as further described in "--Limitation on Enforcement of

Intra-Group Liabilities--Manner of Enforcement"); or

(b)

prior to the later of the Super

<<<

 Senior Discharge Date and the Senior Secured Discharge Date, if the Security

Agent has been instructed by the Senior Secured Instructing Group not to enforce or to cease to enforce the

Transaction Security or the Security Agent has received

<<<

 no instructions from the Senior Secured Instructing

Group and, in each case, the Senior Secured Instructing Group has not required any Debtor to make a

Distressed Disposal (as defined in "--Release of the Guarantees and the Security--Distressed

<<<

 Disposal"),

the Security Agent shall give effect to any instructions to enforce the Transaction Security which the

Second Lien Debt Representative (acting on the instructions of the Second Lien Notes/Second Lien

Required Holders) are then

<<<

 entitled to give,

provided that if the Second Lien Debt Representative either gives such instruction or indicates any intention to give such instruction, then either the Credit Facility Agent, the Senior Secured Notes Trustee or the Pari Passu

<<<

 Debt Representative may give the Security Agent instructions to enforce the Transaction Security as such Credit Facility Agent, the Senior Secured Notes Trustee or Pari Passu Debt Representative sees fit in lieu of any instructions to enforce

<<<

 given by the Second Lien Notes Trustee or the Second Lien Debt Representative and the Security Agent shall act on the first such instructions received from such Credit Facility Agent, the Senior Secured Notes Trustee or the Pari Passu Debt

<<<

 Representative.

The Security Agent may disregard any instructions from any other person to enforce the Transaction Security and may disregard any instructions to enforce any Transaction Security if those instructions are inconsistent with

<<<

 the Intercreditor Agreement. The Security Agent is not obligated to enforce the Transaction Security if it is not indemnified and secured to its satisfaction (including by way of prefunding) by the relevant creditors.

Limitation on Enforcement

<<<

 by Super Senior Creditors and Senior Secured Noteholders

If either the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Senior Secured Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders (acting through their Creditor Representatives) wish to instruct the Security Agent

<<<

 to commence enforcement of any Transaction Security, such group of creditors must deliver a copy of the proposed instructions as to enforcement (the "Enforcement Proposal") to the Security Agent and the Creditor Representatives for each of

<<<

 the Super Senior Creditors, the Senior Secured Creditors and the Second Lien Creditors (as appropriate) at least ten business days prior to the proposed date of issuance of instructions under such enforcement proposal (the "Proposed Enforcement

<<<

 Instruction Date").

Until the Super Senior Discharge Date, if the Security Agent has received conflicting enforcement instructions (which for the purposes of this paragraph only, includes a failure to give any instruction by the Majority Super

<<<

 Senior Creditors or the Senior Secured Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders), then the Security Agent will promptly notify the relevant Creditor

108

 Creditors or the Senior Secured Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders (in each case, acting reasonably) consider that the Security Agent is enforcing the Transaction Security in a manner which is not consistent with the Security Enforcement Principles

Security Enforcement Principles

The Majority Super Senior Creditors or Majority Senior Secured Creditors may only give enforcement instructions

<<<

 that are consistent with the following security enforcement principles (the "Security Enforcement Principles"), including that:

(a)

it shall be the primary and overriding aim of any enforcement of the transaction security to achieve the


<<<


security enforcement objective (being to maximize so far as is consistent with prompt and expeditious

realization of value from enforcement of the Transaction Security, the recovery by the Super Senior

Creditors and the Senior Secured Creditors

<<<

) (the "Security Enforcement Objective");

(b)

without prejudice to the Security Enforcement Objective, the Transaction Security will be enforced and

other enforcement action will be taken such that either:

(i)

all proceeds of enforcement

<<<

 are received by the Security Agent in cash for distribution in

accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (see "--Application of Proceeds");

or

(ii)

with respect to such actions taken by the Senior Secured Notes/Pari Passu

<<<

 Required Holders,

sufficient proceeds from enforcement will be received by the Security Agent in cash to ensure

that when the proceeds are applied in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement

(see "--Application of Proceeds

<<<

"), the Super Senior Liabilities are repaid and discharged in

full (unless the Majority Super Senior Creditors agree otherwise);

(c)

the enforcement actions are prompt and expeditious it being acknowledged that, subject to the other

provisions

<<<

 of the Intercreditor Agreement, the time frame for the realization of value from the enforcement

of the Transaction Security or distressed disposal pursuant to enforcement will be determined by the Senior

Secured Instructing Group (the Majority

<<<

 Super Senior Creditors or Majority Senior Secured Creditors)

provided that it is consistent with the Security Enforcement Objective;

(d)

to the extent that the Transaction Security that is the subject of the proposed enforcement action is

<<<

:

(i)

over assets other than shares in a member of the Group where the aggregate book value of such

assets exceeds 1.0 million (or its equivalent); or

(ii)

over some or all of the shares in a member of the Group over which Transaction Security

<<<



exists,

the Security Agent shall, upon instruction from the Senior Secured Instructing Group and at the expense of the Senior Secured Instructing Group (unless it is incompatible with enforcement proceedings in a relevant jurisdiction) appoint

<<<

, an internationally recognized investment bank or any one of BDO, Deloitte & Touche, Ernst & Young, Grant Thornton, KPMG or PricewaterhouseCoopers or, if it is not practicable for the Security Agent to appoint any such bank or firm on commercially

<<<

 reasonable terms (including for reasons of conflicts of interest) as determined by the Security Agent (acting in good faith), another

110

third party professional firm which is regularly engaged in providing valuations in respect of the

<<<

 relevant type of assets (in each case not being the firm appointed as the relevant Debtor's administrator or other relevant officer holder) selected by the Security Agent (a "Financial Advisor") to opine as expert that the proceeds received

<<<

 from any such enforcement are fair from a financial point of view after taking into account all relevant circumstances, provided that the Security Agent shall be under no obligation to appoint a Financial Advisor or to seek the advice of a

<<<

 Financial Advisor, unless expressly required to do so by the Intercreditor Agreement;

(e)

the Financial Advisor's Opinion (or any equivalent opinion obtained by the Security Agent in relation to

any other enforcement of the Collateral that

<<<

 such action is fair from a financial point of view after taking

into account all relevant circumstances) will be conclusive evidence that the Security Enforcement

Objective has been met;

(f)

where the Senior Secured Instructing Group is

<<<

 the Senior Secured Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders, the

Senior Secured Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders may waive the requirement for a Financial Advisor's

Opinion where sufficient proceeds from the proposed enforcement will be received

<<<

 by the Security Agent

in cash to ensure that when the proceeds are applied in accordance with the application of proceeds set out

in the Intercreditor Agreement, the Super Senior Liabilities are repaid and discharged in full; and

(g)

in

<<<

 the event that an enforcement of the Collateral is conducted by way of competitive process, no Financial

Advisor shall be required to be appointed, and no Financial Advisor's Opinion shall be required, in relation

to such enforcement provided

<<<

 that the Security Agent shall be entitled (but not obliged) to appoint a

Financial Advisor to provide such advice as the Security Agent deems appropriate in relation to such

enforcement by way of competitive process.

<<<

 notice from a creditor or group of creditors that are not part of the relevant instructing group that such creditor(s) object to any enforcement of the transaction security on the grounds that such enforcement action does not aim to achieve

<<<

 the Security Enforcement Objective or is not in accordance with the Security Enforcement Principles (an "Objection"), the Security Agent is entitled to assume that such enforcement of the transaction security is in accordance with the Security

<<<

 Enforcement Objective and the Security Enforcement Principles.

If the Security Agent receives an Objection (and without prejudice to the ability of the Security Agent to rely on other advisors and/or exercise its own judgment in accordance

<<<

 with the Intercreditor Agreement), a Financial Advisor's Opinion to the effect that the particular action could reasonably be said to be aimed at achieving the Security Enforcement Objective or the Security Enforcement Principles will be conclusive

<<<

 evidence that the Security Enforcement Objective and the Security Enforcement Principles have been met.

The Security Enforcement Principles may be amended, varied or waived with the prior written consent of the Majority Super Senior Creditors

<<<

, the Senior Secured Notes Required Holders, the Pari Passu Debt Required Holders of each tranche of Pari Passu Debt and the Security Agent.

Manner of Enforcement

The Security Agent shall enforce the Transaction Security in such manner (including

<<<

Guarantees and the Security--Distressed Disposal") has not given instructions as to the

manner of enforcement of the Collateral,

<<<

 of each relevant Transaction Security Document and provided that any such instructions are consistent with the Security Enforcement Principles.

The instructing group entitled to give instructions to the Security Agent in respect of enforcement

<<<

 of Transaction Security (the "Senior Secured Instructing Group") will comprise the Majority Super Senior Creditors and the Senior Secured Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders (in each case acting through their respective Creditor Representative

<<<

). However, if the Security Agent has received conflicting enforcement instructions from the Creditor Representatives then, provided that the

111

instructions from the Senior Secured Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders (to the extent given

<<<

) comply with the initial consultation requirements described above and the Security Enforcement Principles, the Security Agent will comply with the instructions from the Senior Secured Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders, provided that if the

<<<

 Super Senior Liabilities have not been fully discharged within six months, or no steps have been taken in relation to the commencement of enforcement of the Transaction Security within three months, in each case, of the date on which the first

<<<

 such enforcement instructions were issued, then the instructions of the Majority Super Senior Creditors will prevail.

Exercise of Voting Rights

<<<

 Secured Notes Trustee, the Pari Passu Debt Representative and the Second Lien Debt Representative) will cast its vote in any proposal put to the vote by or under the supervision of any judicial or supervisory authority in respect of any insolvency

<<<

, pre-insolvency or rehabilitation or similar proceedings relating to any member of the Group as instructed by the Security Agent and the Security Agent shall give instructions for these purposes as directed by the Senior Secured Instructing

<<<

 Group, provided that such instructions have been given in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

 to each Credit Facility Lender and each other finance party under such Credit Facility Document or Hedge Counterparty (each an "Indemnified Party") for any actual or alleged obligation to repay or claw back any amount received by such Indemnified

DESCRIPTION

<<<

 OF THE SENIOR SECURED NOTES
You will find definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this "Description of the Senior Secured Notes" under the heading "Certain Definitions." For purposes of this "Description of the Senior Secured Notes

<<<

," references to the "Issuer" "we," "our," and "us" refer only to Bravida Holding AB (publ).
The Issuer has issued, 225 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2019 (the "EUR Senior Secured Floating Rate

<<<

 Notes") and SEK 1,300 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2019 (the "SEK Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes" and, together with the EUR Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes, the "Senior Secured Notes"

<<<

). The Senior Secured Notes were issued under an indenture dated as of June 11, 2013 (the "Senior Secured Indenture"), between, inter alios, the Issuer, the Initial Guarantors (as defined below), Deutsche Trustee Company Limited, as trustee

<<<

 (the "Trustee") and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as security agent (in such capacity, the "Security Agent") and paying agent, in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Senior

<<<

 Secured Indenture does not incorporate or include terms of, or be subject to, the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.
The proceeds of the issue of the Senior Secured Notes sold on the Issue Date have been used by the Issuer to fund

<<<

 the refinancing of its existing credit facilities and to pay costs and expenses incurred in connection with the issue of the Senior Secured Notes and the Refinancing as set forth in this Prospectus under the caption "Use of Proceeds."
The Senior

<<<

 Secured Indenture is unlimited in aggregate principal amount. We may, subject to applicable law, issue an unlimited principal amount of additional Senior Secured Notes having identical terms and conditions as the Senior Secured Notes (the 

<<<

"Additional Senior Secured Notes"); provided, that if the Additional Senior Secured Notes are not fungible with the Senior Secured Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Additional Senior Secured Notes will be issued with a separate

<<<

 ISIN code or common code, as applicable, from the Senior Secured Notes. We will only be permitted to issue Additional Senior Secured Notes in compliance with the covenants contained in the Senior Secured Indenture, including the covenants restricting

<<<

 the Incurrence of Indebtedness and the Incurrence of Liens (as described below under "--Certain Covenants--Limitation on Indebtedness" and "--Certain Covenants--Limitation on Liens"). Except as otherwise provided for in the Senior Secured Indenture

<<<

, the Senior Secured Notes issued in the Issue and, if issued, any Additional Senior Secured Notes will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Senior Secured Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to waivers

<<<

, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. Unless the context otherwise requires, in this "Description of the Senior Secured Notes," references to the "Senior Secured Notes" include the Senior Secured Notes and any Additional Senior Secured

<<<

 Notes that are actually issued.
The Senior Secured Indenture is subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreements (as defined below). The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding

<<<

 the terms and ranking of the Liens on the Collateral. See "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements--Intercreditor Agreement" for a description of the material terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.
This "Description of the Senior Secured

<<<

 Notes" is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Indenture and the Security Documents. Since this description of the terms of the Senior Secured Notes is only a summary, you should

<<<

 refer to the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Indenture and the Security Documents for complete descriptions of the obligations of the Issuer and your rights. Copies of such documents are available from us upon request.
The registered

<<<

 Holder of a Senior Secured Note is treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered Holders have rights under the Senior Secured Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to enforcement and the pursuit of other remedies

<<<

. The Senior Secured Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act and are subject to certain transfer restrictions.
General
The Senior Secured Notes
The Senior Secured Notes:
· are general senior obligations

<<<

 of the Issuer, secured as set forth under "--Security";
· rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuer that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes, including the obligations

<<<

 of the Issuer under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain Hedging Obligations;
· rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuer that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured

<<<

 Notes;
118

· are effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries that is secured by property and assets that do not secure the Senior Secured Notes, to the extent of the value

<<<

 of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness;
· are guaranteed by the Initial Guarantors;
· are structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of the Issuer that are not Guarantors, including obligations

<<<

 to trade creditors;
· mature on June 15, 2019; and
· are represented by one or more registered Senior Secured Notes in global form, but in certain circumstances may be represented by Definitive Registered Notes (see "Book-Entry, Delivery and

<<<

 Form").
Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes will receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral only after certain super senior priority obligations, including (i) obligations under

<<<

 the Revolving Credit Facility (or any Refinancing Indebtedness of the Revolving Credit Facility that is entitled to rank senior to the Senior Secured Notes with respect to the proceeds of an enforcement of the Collateral) and (ii) certain Hedging

<<<

 Obligations have been repaid in full.
The Notes Guarantees
The Senior Secured Notes are guaranteed by the Initial Guarantors. In addition, if required by the covenant described under "--Certain Covenants--Additional Guarantees," certain other

<<<

 Restricted Subsidiaries may provide a Notes Guarantee in the future.
The Notes Guarantee of each Guarantor:
· is a general senior obligation of that Guarantor, secured as set forth under "--Security";
· ranks pari passu in right of payment

<<<

 with any existing and future Indebtedness of that Guarantor that is not subordinated in right of payment to such Notes Guarantee (including Indebtedness Incurred under the Revolving Credit Facility);
· ranks senior in right of payment to any

<<<

 existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Notes Guarantee; and
· is effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of such Guarantor that is

<<<

 secured by property and assets that do not secure such Notes Guarantee, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness.
The obligations of a Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee will be limited as necessary

<<<

 to prevent the relevant Notes Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or unlawful financial assistance under applicable law, or otherwise to reflect limitations under applicable law. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor's

<<<

 obligation under its Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee. See "Risk Factors--Risks Related to

<<<

 our Structure--The Note Guarantees and security interests on the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability

<<<

."
As of the Issue Date, all of our Subsidiaries were "Restricted Subsidiaries" for purposes of the Senior Secured Indenture. However, under the circumstances described below under "--Certain Definitions--Unrestricted Subsidiary," we are permitted

<<<

 to designate certain of our Subsidiaries as "Unrestricted Subsidiaries." Our Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Senior Secured Indenture and will not guarantee the Senior Secured Notes.

<<<


Principal and Maturity
On the Issue Date, the Issuer has issued:
· SEK 1,300 million in aggregate principal amount of SEK Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes; and
· 225 million in aggregate principal amount of EUR Senior Secured Floating Rate

<<<

 Notes.
The Senior Secured Notes will mature on June 15, 2019. The SEK Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes were issued in minimum denominations of SEK 1,000,000 and integral multiples of SEK 10,000 in excess thereof. The EUR Senior Secured Floating

<<<

 Rate Notes were issued in minimum denominations of 100,000 and in integral multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof.
119

Interest
SEK Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes
Interest on the SEK Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes will accrue at a rate

<<<

 per annum (the "Applicable Rate"), reset quarterly, equal to the sum of (i) three-month STIBOR plus (ii) 5.375%, as determined by the Calculation Agent. Interest on the SEK Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes:
· accrues from the Issue Date or

<<<

, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently paid;
· is payable in cash quarterly in arrears on September 15, December 15, March 15 and June 15, commencing on September 15, 2013;
· is payable to the holder of record

<<<

 of such SEK Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes on the September 1, December 1, March 1 and June 1 immediately preceding the related interest payment date; and
· is computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed

<<<

.
Set forth below is a summary of certain of the provisions from the Senior Secured Indenture relating to the calculation of interest on the SEK Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes.
"Determination Date" with respect to an Interest Period, means

<<<

 the day that is two Stockholm Business Days preceding the first day of such Interest Period.
"STIBOR" with respect to an Interest Period, means the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for deposits in SEK for a three-month period beginning

<<<

 on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date that appears on Reuters Page Side as of 11:00 a.m. Stockholm time, on the Determination Date. If Reuters Page Side does not include such a rate or is unavailable on

<<<

 a Determination Date, the Calculation Agent will request the principal Stockholm office of each of four major banks in the Stockholm inter-bank market, as selected by the Calculation Agent, to provide such bank's offered quotation (expressed

<<<

 as a percentage per annum) as of approximately 11:00 a.m., Stockholm time, on such Determination Date, to prime banks in the Stockholm inter-bank market for deposits in a Representative Amount in SEK for a three-month period beginning on the

<<<

 day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such offered quotations are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations

<<<

 are so provided, the Calculation Agent will request each of three major banks in Stockholm, as selected by the Calculation Agent, to provide such bank's rate (expressed as a percentage per annum), as of approximately 11:00 a.m., Stockholm time

<<<

, on such Determination Date, for loans in a Representative Amount in SEK to leading European banks for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If fewer than two such quotations

<<<

 are provided as requested, the Agent Bank will determine the arithmetic mean (rounded, if necessary, as aforesaid) of the rates quoted by major banks in Stockholm, selected by the Agent Bank, at approximately 11.00 a.m. (Stockholm time) on

<<<

 the first day of the relevant Interest Period for loans in SEK to leading European banks for three months and in an amount that is representative for a single transaction in that market at that time.
"Interest Period" means the period commencing

<<<

 on and including an interest payment date and ending on and including the day immediately preceding the next succeeding interest payment date, with the exception that the first Interest Period shall commence on and include the Issue Date and

<<<

 end on and include June 15, 2013.
"Representative Amount" means the greater of (i) SEK 10,000,000 and (ii) an amount that is representative for a single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time.
"Reuters Page Side" means the

<<<

 display page so designated on Reuters (or such other page as may replace that page on that service, or such other service as may be nominated as the information vendor).
"TARGET Settlement Day" means any day on which the Trans-European Automated

<<<

 Real-Time Gross Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET) System is open.
The Calculation Agent shall, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m. (Stockholm time) on each Determination Date, determine the Applicable Rate and calculate the aggregate

<<<

 amount of interest payable in respect of the following Interest Period (the "Interest Amount"). The Interest Amount shall be calculated by applying the Applicable Rate to the principal amount of each Floating Rate Note outstanding at the commencement

<<<

 of the Interest Period, multiplying each such amount by the actual amounts of days in the Interest Period concerned divided by 360. All percentages resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one

<<<

 hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point being rounded upwards (e.g., 4.876545% (or .04876545) being rounded to 4.87655% (or .0487655). The determination of the Applicable Rate and the Interest

<<<

 Amount by the Calculation Agent shall, in the absence of willful default, bad faith or manifest error, be final and binding on all parties. In no event will the rate of interest on the Floating Rate Notes be higher than the maximum rate permitted

<<<

 by applicable law, provided, however, that the Calculation Agent shall not be responsible for verifying that the rate of interest on the Floating Rate Notes is permitted under any applicable law.
120

The rights of Holders to receive the payments

<<<

 of interest on such Senior Secured Notes are subject to applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Senior Secured Notes is not a Business Day at the place at which such payment is due

<<<

 to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.
Methods

<<<

Principal, interest and premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Global Notes (as defined below) are payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents by wire transfer

<<<

The Issuer maintains one or more Paying Agents for the Senior

<<<

 Secured Notes in the City of London (including the Principal Paying Agent). The Issuer also undertakes to maintain a Paying Agent in a European Union member state that is not obligated to withhold or deduct tax pursuant to the European Union

<<<

 Directive 2003/48/EC or any other directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN meeting of 26 and 27 November 2000 regarding the taxation of savings income (the "Directive"), or any law implementing or complying with or introduced in

<<<

 order to conform to, such Directive. The initial Paying Agent is Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch (the "Principal Paying Agent").

Notes Guarantees
General
The obligations of the Issuer pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes, including any payment obligation resulting from a Change of Control, are guaranteed, jointly and severally on a senior basis, by the Guarantors 

<<<

(each such guarantee, a "Notes Guarantee").
The initial Guarantors and their respective jurisdictions of incorporation are as follows (the "Initial Guarantors"):

Bravida Installation och Service AB..........................................

The aggregate amount of the obligations and

<<<

 liabilities of each Guarantor incorporated in Sweden (each a "Swedish Guarantor") under the applicable Notes Guarantee, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement, any other Security Document and the Purchase Agreement

<<<

 (each undefined term as defined in this Intercreditor Agreement) is limited in respect of liabilities and obligations owed by any entity which is not that Swedish Guarantor or a wholly-owned Subsidiary to such Swedish Guarantor as follows:

<<<

 (i) Bravida Holding AB's aggregate obligations and liabilities are not limited; (ii) Bravida Installation och Service AB's aggregate obligations and liabilities are limited to SEK3,451 million; (iii) Scandinavian Installation Acquisition AB

<<<

's aggregate obligations and liabilities are limited to SEK1,722 million; (iv) Bravida AB's aggregate obligations and liabilities are limited to SEK1,560 million; (v) Bravida Sverige AB's aggregate obligations and liabilities are limited to

<<<

 SEK746 million; and (vi) Bravida Prenad AB's aggregate obligations and liabilities are limited to SEK56 million. The above limitations have been made to ensure that the relevant Swedish Guarantor complies with the provisions of the Swedish

<<<

 Companies Act (Sw. aktiebolagslagen (2005:551)) in force from time to time governing guarantees and regulating distribution of assets within the meaning of the Swedish Companies Act.

121

The obligations and liabilities of each Guarantor

<<<

 incorporated in Norway (each a "Norwegian Guarantor") under the applicable Notes Guarantee are limited to the extent necessary to comply with the mandatory provisions of Sections 8-7 and 8-10 of the Norwegian Limited Companies Act (act of 

<<<

13 June 1997 no 44), regarding unlawful financial assistance and other restrictions on a Norwegian limited liability company's ability to grant and/or honor guarantees, loans or securities in favor of or on behalf of the Issuer or its subsidiaries

<<<

. The obligations and liabilities of each Norwegian Guarantor are limited to SEK5,000,000,000, plus any unpaid amount of interest, fees, liability, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Issue.
The obligations and liabilities of

<<<

 any Guarantor incorporated under the laws of Denmark (each a "Danish Guarantor") under the applicable Notes Guarantee are limited if and to the extent required to comply with Danish statutory provisions, including, without limitation, (i) Section

<<<

 206(1) (as modified by Section 206(2)) of Consolidated Act No.322 of 11 April 2011 on public and private limited liability companies, as amended and supplemented from time to time (the "Danish Companies Act") and (ii) Section 210(1) (as modified

<<<

 by Section 210(2) and Sections 211 and 212 of the Danish Companies Act) and, accordingly, will not include, and will not be or be construed as, an indemnity, guarantee or security in respect of (x) any obligations incurred or undertaken in

<<<

 relation to the financing of a direct acquisition of shares issued or to become issued by such Danish Guarantor or by a direct or indirect qualifying parent company of such Danish Guarantor ("Acquisition Debt") or (y) any obligations other

<<<

 than Acquisition Debt of a shareholder or parent company other than a parent company that is incorporated under the laws of any country covered by Executive Order No. 275 of 25 March 2010 on loans to foreign parent companies, as amended and

<<<

 supplemented from time to time. The obligations and liabilities of each Danish Guarantor are further limited to the amount equivalent to the higher of (i) its distributable equity on the Issue Date and (ii) its distributable equity at the time

<<<

 or times that payment is requested from it, save that these limitations will not apply to any obligations and liabilities of a Danish Guarantor in respect of proceeds from the sale of the Senior Secured Notes that are placed at the disposal

<<<

 of the Danish Guarantor by the Issuer by way of a loan or otherwise (other than as share capital).
The limitations set forth above apply mutatis mutandis to any security created by a Danish Guarantor pursuant to the Security Documents and to

<<<

 any guarantee, indemnity or any similar obligation resulting in a payment obligation and payment, including but not limited to set off or subordination, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement or any other Transaction Document and made by any Danish

<<<

 Guarantor.
As of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2013, the Initial Guarantors accounted for 91.4% of the consolidated total tangible assets, 93.0% of the consolidated net sales and 90.7% of the consolidated EBITDA of the Group. For

<<<

 information on the calculation of the figures contained in this paragraph, see "Presentation of Information."
Each Notes Guarantee is limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor's obligations subject to avoidance under

<<<

 applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue

<<<

 of this limitation, a Guarantor's obligation under its Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee. See

<<<

 "Risk Factors--Risks Related to Our Structure--The Notes Guarantee and security interests on the Collatoral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may

<<<

 limit their validity and enforceability".
A substantial portion of the operations of the Issuer will be conducted through their Restricted Subsidiaries. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, including trade creditors

<<<

, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those Restricted Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the

<<<

 assets and earnings of those Restricted Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including Holders of the Senior Secured Notes. The Senior Secured Notes and each Notes Guarantee therefore will be effectively

<<<

 subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer (other than the Guarantors). As of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2012, net sales, EBITDA

<<<

 and tangible assets of our subsidiaries not guaranteeing the Notes represented 7.0%, 9.3% and 8.6% of the consolidated net sales, consolidated EBITDA and consolidated total tangible assets of the Group, respectively. Although the Senior Secured

<<<

 Indenture will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Senior Secured Indenture does not impose

<<<

 any limitation on the Incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Senior Secured Indenture. See "--Certain Covenants--Limitation on Indebtedness

<<<

." As of March 31, 2013, after giving recalculation effect to the Refinancing, the Issuer and its consolidated Subsidiaries would have had SEK2,628 million of Indebtedness, all of which would have been represented by the Senior Secured Notes

<<<

. As of March 31, 2013, after giving effect to the Issue, the Issuer's subsidiaries that are not guaranteeing the Senior Secured Notes would have had no outstanding long-term financial indebtedness. In addition, there would have been SEK550

<<<

 million available for drawing under the Revolving Credit Facility.
Notes Guarantees Release
The Notes Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate and release upon:
· a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the

<<<

 Capital Stock of the relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding company), or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary), if the

<<<

 sale or other disposition
122

does not violate the Senior Secured Indenture and the Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer as a result of the sale or other disposition;

Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries
Immediately after the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes, all the Issuer's Subsidiaries became Restricted Subsidiaries. However, in the circumstances described below under "-

<<<

-Certain Definitions--Unrestricted Subsidiary," the Issuer is permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Senior Secured

<<<

 Indenture.
Security
General
The Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Indenture, together with obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain Hedging Obligations, are secured by security interests granted on an equal and

<<<

 ratable first-priority basis over all of the shares of the Guarantors and certain material subsidiaries of Bravida Sverige AB, together with security over certain material real estate, downstream intra-group loans, bank accounts of the Issuer

<<<

 and Bravida Installation och Service AB not connected to the Group's cash pooling arrangements, certain Swedish business mortgage certificates and certain Norwegian floating charges (the "Collateral").
Subject to certain conditions, including

<<<

 compliance with the covenants described under "--Certain Covenants-- Impairment of Security Interest" and "--Certain Covenants--Limitations on Liens," the Issuer is permitted to grant security over the Collateral in connection with future issuances

<<<

 of Indebtedness or Indebtedness of the Restricted Subsidiaries, including Additional Senior Secured Notes, as permitted under the Senior Secured Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.
The Collateral is pledged pursuant to the Security Documents

<<<

 to the Security Agent on behalf of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and holders of the other secured obligations that are secured by the Collateral. Any other security interests that may in the future be granted to secure obligations

<<<

 under the Senior Secured Notes, any Notes Guarantees and the Senior Secured Indenture would also constitute "Collateral." All Collateral will be subject to any Permitted Collateral Liens.
The Liens on the Collateral are limited as necessary

<<<

 to recognize certain limitations arising under or imposed by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance

<<<

, corporate purpose or benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.
The proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may not

<<<

 be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the holders of the Senior Secured Notes. No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with the Issue of the Senior Secured Notes. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral

<<<

 will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. See "Risk Factors--Risks Related to the Notes-- The value of the Collateral securing

<<<

 the Notes and the Note Guarantees may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Notes, and there may be limitations on your ability to foreclose on the Collateral."
123

Priority
The relative priority with regard to the security

<<<

 interests in the Collateral that are created by the Security Documents (the "Security Interests" and each, a "Security Interest") as between (a) the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, (b) the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations

<<<

 and (c) the Trustee, the Security Agent and the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes under the Senior Secured Indenture, respectively, is established by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Revolving Credit Facility, the Senior Secured

<<<

 Indenture, the Security Documents and the security documents relating to the Revolving Credit Facility and such Hedging Obligations, which provide, among other things, that the obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain Hedging

<<<

 Obligations and the Senior Secured Notes are secured equally and ratably by a first-priority Security Interests; however, under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the holders of Senior Secured Notes will only receive proceeds from the

<<<

 enforcement of the Collateral after certain super senior priority obligations including (i) obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and (ii) certain Hedging Obligations have been paid in full. See "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements

<<<

-- Intercreditor Agreement." In addition, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreements or Additional Intercreditor Agreements entered into after the Issue Date, the Collateral may be pledged to secure other Indebtedness. See "--Release of Liens

<<<

," "--Certain Covenants--Impairment of Security Interest" and "--Certain Definitions--Permitted Collateral Liens."
Security Documents
Under the Security Documents, the Issuer and the Guarantors have granted security over the Collateral to secure

<<<

 the payment when due of the Issuer's and the Guarantors' payment obligations under the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. The Security Documents have been entered into by the relevant security provider and the

<<<

 Security Agent as agent for the secured parties. When entering into the Security Documents, the Security Agent acted in its own name, but for the benefit of the secured parties (including itself, the Trustee and the holders of Senior Secured

<<<

 Notes from time to time). Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent also acts as an agent of the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations in relation to the Security Interests

<<<

 created in favor of such parties.
The Senior Secured Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement provide that, to the extent permitted by the applicable laws, only the Security Agent has the right to enforce the Security Documents on behalf of

<<<

 the Senior Secured Notes Trustee and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes. As a consequence of such contractual provisions, holders of the Senior Secured Notes are not entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing

<<<

 the Senior Secured Notes, except through the Trustee under the Senior Secured Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the Senior Secured Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent for the Collateral.
The Senior Secured

<<<

 Indenture provides that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Indenture, as applicable, will be secured by Security Interests in the Collateral

<<<

 until all obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Indenture have been discharged. However, the Security Interests with respect to the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Indenture may be released under certain

<<<

 circumstances as provided under "--Release of Liens."
In the event that the Issuer or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings, the Security Interests created under the Security Documents or the rights and obligations

<<<

 enumerated in the Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of the Security Interests or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement was successful, the Holders may not be able to recover

<<<

 any amounts under the Security Documents. See "Risk Factors--Risks Related to the Notes."
Enforcement of Security Interest
The Senior Secured Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement restrict the ability of the Holders or the Trustee to enforce

<<<

 the Security Interests and provide for the release of the Security Interests created by the Security Documents in certain circumstances upon enforcement by the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility. These limitations are described under

<<<

 "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements--Intercreditor Agreement". The ability to enforce may also be restricted by similar arrangements in relation to future Indebtedness that is secured on the Collateral in compliance with the Senior

<<<

 Secured Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.
The creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, the counterparties to Hedging Obligations secured by the Collateral and the Trustee have, and by accepting a Senior Secured Note, each Holder

<<<

 will be deemed to have, appointed the Security Agent to act as its agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents securing such Indebtedness, including the Security Documents. The creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility

<<<

, the holders of Senior Secured Notes, the counterparties to Hedging Obligations secured by the Collateral and the Trustee have, and by accepting a Senior Secured Note, each Holder will be deemed to have, authorized the Security Agent to (i

<<<

) perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents securing such Indebtedness, together with any other incidental rights, power

<<<

 and discretions; and (ii) execute each Security Document, waiver, modification, amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the Security Agent on its behalf.

Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements

<<<

; Agreement to be Bound
The Senior Secured Indenture provides that the Issuer and the Trustee will be authorized (without any further consent of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes) to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement to give effect

<<<

 to the provisions described in the section entitled "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements--Intercreditor Agreement."

The Senior Secured Indenture also provides that each holder of the Senior Secured Notes, by accepting such Note,

<<<

 is deemed to have:

(1)

appointed and authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in the

Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents;

(2)

agreed to be bound

<<<

 by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor

Agreements and the Security Documents; and

(3)

irrevocably appointed the Security Agent and the Trustee to act on its behalf to enter into and comply with

the

<<<

 provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Security

Documents.

See the sections entitled "Risk Factors--Risks Related to the Notes--The security over the Collateral will not be granted directly

<<<

 to the holders of the Notes, and the holders of the Notes will have limited rights to enforce remedies under the Security Documents" and "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements--Intercreditor Agreement."

Similar provisions to those

<<<

 described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below) entered into in compliance with the covenant described under "--Certain Covenants--Additional Intercreditor Agreements."

Release of Liens

The Issuer

<<<

 and its Subsidiaries are entitled to release the Security Interests in respect of the Collateral under any one or more of the following circumstances:

(1)

in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral to a Person that is

<<<

 not the Issuer or a

Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction subject to "--Certain Covenants--Merger and

Consolidation"), if such sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant described under "--Certain

Covenants--Limitation

<<<

 on Sale of Assets and Subsidiary Stock" or is otherwise permitted in accordance

with the Senior Secured Indenture;

(2)

in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Notes Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the Senior

Secured Indenture

<<<

, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor;

(3)

as described under "--Amendments and Waivers";

(4)

upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Senior Secured Notes or legal

<<<



defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Secured Notes, as provided in

"--Defeasance" and "--Satisfaction and Discharge";

(5)

if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary

 in accordance with the

applicable provisions of the Senior Secured Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital

Stock, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(6)

to effect a Permitted Reorganization; or

(7)

as otherwise permitted

<<<

 in accordance with the Senior Secured Indenture.

In addition, the Security Interests created by the Security Documents will be released (a) in accordance with an enforcement action pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional

<<<

 Intercreditor Agreement and (b) as may be permitted by the covenant described under "--Certain Covenants--Impairment of Security Interest."

The Security Agent and the Trustee (but only if required) will take all necessary action reasonably

<<<

 requested by the Issuer to effectuate any release of Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes and the Notes Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions of the Senior Secured Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor

<<<

 Agreement and the relevant Security Document. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the Holders or any action on the part of the Trustee (unless action is required by it to effect

<<<

 such release).

Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision in the Senior Secured Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Revolving Credit Facility, the Security

<<<

 Documents and the security documents relating to the Revolving Credit Facility and such Hedging Obligations, the release of any Security Interest in

125

respect of Collateral governed by Swedish law will, until the date of irrevocable and

<<<

 unconditional payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations of the Senior Secured Notes, always be subject to the prior written consent of the Security Agent.

Optional Redemption
The SEK Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes

<<<

 may be redeemed at the redemption prices set out below. Any redemption or redemption notice may, in the Issuer's discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent. Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the

 redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the SEK Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes or portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.

SEK Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes

Except as described below and

General

We may repurchase the Senior Secured Notes at any time and from time to

 time in the open market or otherwise.

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Senior

<<<

 Secured Note is registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Senior Secured Notes will be subject to redemption by the Issuer.

In connection with any redemption of Senior

<<<

 Secured Notes (including with the proceeds from an Equity Offering, to the extent applicable), any such redemption may, at the Issuer's discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent.

Sinking Fund

The Issuer is not required to

<<<

 make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect to the Senior Secured Notes.

Redemption at Maturity

On June 15, 2019, the Issuer will redeem the Senior Secured Notes that have not been previously redeemed or purchased

<<<

 and canceled at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and Additional Amounts, if any, to the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on

 the relevant interest payment date).

Redemption for Taxation Reasons

The Issuer may redeem any series Senior Secured Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior notice to the Holders

<<<

 of the relevant series of Senior Secured Notes (which notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption (a "Tax

 Redemption Date") (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts (as defined below under "-- Withholding Taxes"), if any, then

<<<

 due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if any, if the Issuer determines in good faith that, as a result of:

(1)

any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations

<<<

 or rulings promulgated thereunder)

of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation; or

(2)

any amendment to, or change in an official application, administration or written interpretation of such

laws, treaties,

<<<

 regulations or rulings (including by reason of a holding, judgment or order by a court of

competent jurisdiction or a change in published practice) (each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a

"Change in Tax Law"),

a Payor (as defined

<<<

 below) is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the relevant series of Senior Secured Notes would be, required to pay Additional Amounts with respect to the Senior Secured Notes (but, in the case of a Guarantor, only if the payment

<<<

 giving rise to such requirement cannot be made by the Issuer or another Guarantor who can make such payment without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts), and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to

<<<

 the Payor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable). Such Change in Tax Law must be publicly announced and become effective on or after the Issue Date (or if the applicable

<<<

 Relevant Tax Jurisdiction became a Relevant Tax Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date). The foregoing provisions shall apply (a) to a Guarantor only after such time as such Guarantor is obligated to make at least one

 payment on the Senior Secured Notes and (b) mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to the Senior Secured Indenture, with respect to a change or amendments occurring after the time such successor

<<<

 Person becomes a party to the Senior Secured Indenture.

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described under "-- Selection and Notice." Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice

<<<

 of redemption will be given earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment of Additional Amounts. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of any series of Senior

<<<

 Secured Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer's Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent

<<<

 to its right so to redeem have been satisfied and that it cannot avoid its obligation to pay Additional Amounts by taking reasonable measures available to it and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing and reasonably

<<<

 satisfactory to the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) to the effect that the Issuer has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled

<<<

 to rely on such Officer's Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

Withholding

 Taxes

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (including any successor entity) (each, a "Payor") in respect of the Senior Secured Notes or with respect to any Notes Guarantee, as applicable, will be made free and clear

 of principal, redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts (the "Additional Amounts") as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments

<<<

, after such withholding, or deduction (including any such deduction or withholding from such Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would have been received in respect of such payments on any such Note in the absence of

 such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:

(1)

any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former connection

between the

 relevant Holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member, partner or shareholder

of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder, if the relevant Holder is an estate, nominee, trust,

partnership, limited liability company

 or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including,

without limitation, being resident for tax purposes, or being a citizen or resident or national of, or carrying

on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in, or

 being physically present in, the Relevant

Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition,

ownership or holding of such Senior Secured Note or the receipt of any payment or the exercise

 or

enforcement of rights under such Senior Secured Note, the Senior Secured Indenture or a Notes Guarantee;

(2)

any Tax that is imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial owner of the

Senior Secured Note

 to comply with a reasonable written request of the Payor addressed to the Holder,

after reasonable notice (at least 30 days before any such withholding or deduction such be payable), to

provide certification, information, documents or other

 evidence concerning the nationality, residence or

identity of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any

other reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a statute

, treaty, regulation or

administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from all or part

of such Tax but only to the extent the Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to provide such

certification

 or documentation;

any Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes were imposed as a result of the presentation of the Senior Secured

Note for payment (where Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered Notes and presentation is required)

more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made available for payment to the Holder (except to

the extent that the Holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Senior Secured Note

been presented on the last day

 of such 30 day period);

(4)

any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment of the principal of,

premium, if any, or interest, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes or with respect to any Notes Guarantee

;

(5)

any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, personal property or similar tax, assessment or other

governmental charge;

(6)

any Taxes that are required to be deducted or withheld on a payment to an individual pursuant to

 the

Directive or any law implementing, or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such

Directive;

any Taxes imposed in connection with a Senior Secured Note presented for payment by or on behalf of a

Holder or beneficial

, or any law implementing an

intergovernmental agreement relating thereto; or

128

any combination of the items (1) through (8) above.
In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership

 or any person other than the beneficial owner of the Senior Secured Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary or settler with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner would not have been entitled to

 Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or beneficial owner held such Senior Secured Notes directly.
The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the Relevant

 Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will provide certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, or if such

 tax receipts are not available, certified copies of other reasonable evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee. Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon reasonable request and will be made available

<<<

 at the offices of the Paying Agent.
If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on any Senior Secured Note or any Notes Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor

<<<

 will deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts

<<<

 to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer's Certificate as promptly as practicable

 thereafter). The Trustee shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer's Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.
Wherever in the Senior Secured Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes or this "Description of the Senior

 of the Senior Secured Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant

 interest payment date); provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be obligated to repurchase any series of Senior Secured Notes as described under this heading, "Change of Control," in the event and to the extent that it has unconditionally

<<<

 exercised its right to redeem all of the Senior Secured Notes of such series and given notice of redemption as described under "--Optional Redemption" and that all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived.

129

Unless the

<<<

 Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Senior Secured Notes and given notice of redemption as described under "--Optional Redemption" and all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than

<<<

 the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control, the Issuer will mail a notice (the "Change of Control Offer") to each Holder of any such Senior Secured Notes, with a copy to the Trustee:

(1)

stating that a Change of Control has occurred

<<<

 or may occur and that such Holder has the right to require the

Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder's Senior Secured Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to

101% of the principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes plus accrued

<<<

 and unpaid interest and

Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of

record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the "Change of Control

<<<



Payment");

(2)

stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such

notice is mailed) (the "Change of Control Payment Date");

(3)

stating that any Senior Secured Note accepted for

<<<

 payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will

cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date unless the Change of Control Payment is

not paid, and that any Senior Secured Notes or part thereof not tendered will continue

<<<

 to accrue interest;

(4)

describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute the

Change of Control;

(5)

describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Senior

<<<

 Secured Indenture, that a

Holder must follow in order to have its Senior Secured Notes repurchased; and

(6)

if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control

Offer is conditional

<<<

 on the occurrence of such Change of Control.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful:

(1)

accept for payment all Senior Secured Notes or portion thereof properly

<<<

 tendered pursuant to the Change of

Control Offer;

(2)

deposit with the Principal Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of

all Senior Secured Notes so tendered;

(3)

deliver or cause to be delivered to

<<<

 the Trustee an Officer's Certificate stating the aggregate principal

amount of Senior Secured Notes or portions of the Senior Secured Notes being purchased by the Issuer in

the Change of Control Offer;

(4)

in the case of Global Notes, deliver

<<<

, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) the

Global Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof that

have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer; and


<<<


(5)

in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar for

cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer.

If any Definitive Registered Notes have been

<<<

 issued, the Principal Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Senior Secured Notes, and the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) will, at the cost of the

<<<

 Issuer, promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Definitive Registered Note equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Senior Secured Notes

<<<

 surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Senior Secured Note will be in a principal amount that is at least 100,000 or SEK 1,000,000 (as applicable) and integral multiples of 1,000 or SEK 10,000 in excess thereof (as applicable).

Except

<<<

 as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Senior Secured Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Senior Secured Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization

<<<

 or similar transaction. Holders' right to require the Issuer to repurchase Senior Secured Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that

<<<

 would constitute a Change of Control.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with

<<<

 the requirements set forth in the Senior Secured Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding

<<<

 anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place providing for the Change

<<<

 of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made.
130

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the

<<<

 repurchase of Senior Secured Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Senior Secured Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities

<<<

 laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Senior Secured Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

The Issuer's ability to repurchase Senior Secured Notes issued

<<<

 by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of Control would require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility

<<<

. In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control under the Revolving Credit Facility and require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under such agreement may not constitute a Change of Control under the Senior Secured

<<<

 Indenture. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the

<<<

 exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial

<<<

 effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer's ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer's then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available

<<<

 when necessary to make any required repurchases. See "Risk Factors--Risks Related to the Notes--We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence of certain events constituting

<<<

 a change of control as required by the Indenture."

The definition of "Change of Control" includes a disposition, in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries

<<<

 taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase "substantially all," there is no precise established definition of the phrase "substantially all" under applicable law. Accordingly

<<<

, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of "all or substantially all" of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. As

<<<

 a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as described above.

The provisions of the Senior Secured Indenture

<<<

 relating to the Issuer's obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the

<<<

 Senior Secured Notes.

Certain Covenants

Limitation on Indebtedness

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to Incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness); provided, however, that the Issuer

<<<

 may Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) if, after giving pro forma effect to the Incurrence of such Indebtedness (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof), (1) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Issuer

<<<

 and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0; and, (2) to the extent that the Indebtedness is Senior Secured Indebtedness, on the date of such Incurrence the Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage ratio for the Issuer and

<<<

 its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been no greater than 5.0 to 1.0.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness ("Permitted Debt"):

(1)

Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to any Credit

 Facility (including in respect of letters of credit or bankers'

acceptances issued or created thereunder), and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof and

Guarantees in respect of such Indebtedness in a maximum aggregate principal

<<<

 amount at any time

outstanding not exceeding (i) SEK610.0 million, plus (ii) in the case of any refinancing of any

Indebtedness permitted under this clause (1) or any portion thereof, the aggregate amount of fees,

underwriting discounts

<<<

, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred in connection with such

refinancing;

(2)

(a) Guarantees by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted

Subsidiary, so long as the Incurrence of

<<<

 such Indebtedness is permitted to be Incurred by another provision

of this covenant; provided that, if the Indebtedness being guaranteed is subordinated to or pari passu with

the Senior Secured Notes or a Notes Guarantee, then the guarantee

<<<

 must be subordinated to or pari passu

with the Senior Secured Notes or such Notes Guarantee to the same extent as the Indebtedness being

guaranteed; or

(b) without limiting the covenant described under "--Limitation on Liens," Indebtedness

<<<

 arising by reason of any Lien granted by or applicable to such Person securing Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted under the terms of the Senior Secured Indenture

;

131

(3)

Indebtedness of the Issuer owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of a Restricted

Subsidiary owing to and held by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that:

(a)

if the Issuer or

<<<

 a Guarantor is the obligor on any such Indebtedness and the lender is not the

Issuer or a Guarantor, such Indebtedness is unsecured and, to the extent legally permitted (the

Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries having completed all procedures

<<<

 required in the

reasonable judgment of directors or officers of the obligee or obligor to protect such Persons

from any penalty or civil or criminal liability in connection with the subordination of such

Indebtedness), expressly subordinated

<<<

 to the prior payment in full in cash of all obligations

with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, in the case of the Issuer, or the applicable Notes

Guarantee, in the case of a Guarantor;

(b)

any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital

 Stock or any other event which results in any

such Indebtedness being beneficially held by a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted

Subsidiary of the Issuer and any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person

other

<<<

 than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer, shall be deemed, in each case, to

constitute an Incurrence of such Indebtedness not permitted by this clause (3) by the Issuer or

such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be;



<<<

(4)

(a)

Indebtedness represented by the Senior Secured Notes (other than any Additional Senior

Secured Notes);

(b)

 (3) of this paragraph) outstanding on the Issue Date after

giving effect to the Refinancing (as described under "Use of Proceeds" in the Offering

Memorandum);

covenant, and

(d)

Management Advances;

 Restricted Subsidiary or (ii) Incurred to provide all or a portion of the funds utilized to

consummate the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such Person became a

Restricted Subsidiary or was otherwise acquired

 by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that,

with respect to this clause (5), at the time of such acquisition or other transaction and after giving pro

forma effect to such acquisition or other transaction and to the related Incurrence

<<<

 of Indebtedness, either

(x) the Issuer would have been able to Incur SEK1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the first

paragraph of this covenant or (y) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted

Subsidiaries

<<<

 would not be less than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such acquisition or other

transaction and to the related Incurred of Indebtedness; provided, further, that, unless the Person Incurring

Indebtedness under this clause (5

<<<

) (other than Acquired Indebtedness described in sub-clause (i) of such

clause (5)) is the Issuer or a Guarantor, neither the Issuer nor any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (other than

of such Indebtedness in one of the clauses

 of the second paragraph or the first paragraph of this covenant;

all Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date under the Revolving Credit Facility shall be deemed initially

 similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included;

)

the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the

 accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified

<<<

 Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this "-- Limitation on Indebtedness

." The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be (a) the accreted value thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount and (b) the principal amount, or liquidation preference thereof, in the

 case of any other Indebtedness.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer as of such date (and, if

 such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this "--Limitation on Indebtedness," the Issuer shall be in Default of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any SEK

 Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower SEK Equivalent), in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided that (a) if such

<<<

 Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than SEK, and such refinancing would cause the applicable SEK-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate

<<<

 in effect on the date of such refinancing, such SEK-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the amount set forth in clause (2) of the

 definition of Refinancing Indebtedness; (b) the SEK Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and

<<<

 (c) if any such Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to the SEK) covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in SEK

<<<

 will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall

<<<

 not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness

<<<

 being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

134

Neither the Issuer nor any

<<<

 Guarantor will Incur any Indebtedness (including Permitted Debt) that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor unless such Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in

 right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes and the applicable Notes Guarantee, if any, on substantially identical terms; provided, however, that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other

 Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being secured with different collateral or by virtue of being secured on a junior priority basis or by virtue of the application of waterfall or

 other payment ordering provisions affecting different tranches of Indebtedness.
No Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor solely by virtue of

 being unsecured or by virtue of being secured on a first or junior Lien basis.

Limitation on Restricted Payments

Indebtedness described in sub-clause (i) of such clause (5)) only with the Net Cash Proceeds from the sale

of assets of such non-guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries which

 do not constitute Collateral;

purchase Senior Secured Notes pursuant to an offer to all Holders of the Senior Secured Notes at a

purchase price in cash equal to at least 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid

interest to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant

record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date);

invest in any Replacement Assets;

giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Similar Business is or becomes a Restricted

Subsidiary;

acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock and cash or Cash Equivalents) that are used or useful in a

Similar Business;

(7)

consummate any combination of the foregoing; or

(8)

enter into a binding commitment to apply

 the Net Cash Proceeds pursuant to clause (1), (3), (4), (5) or

(6) of this paragraph or a combination thereof, provided that, a binding commitment shall be treated as a

permitted application of the Net Cash Proceeds from the date of such

 commitment until the earlier of

(x) the date on which such investment is consummated, (y) the 180th day following the expiration of the

aforementioned 365 day period, if the investment has not been consummated by that date,

142

provided

<<<

, however, if the assets disposed of constitute Collateral or constitute all or substantially all of the assets of a Restricted Subsidiary whose Capital Stock has been pledged as Collateral, the Issuer shall pledge or shall cause the applicable

<<<

 Restricted Subsidiary to pledge any acquired Capital Stock or assets (to the extent such assets were of a category of assets included in the Collateral as of the Issue Date) referred to in this covenant in favor of the Senior Secured Notes

<<<

 on a first-priority basis.
The amount of such Net Cash Proceeds not so used as set forth in this paragraph constitutes "Excess Proceeds." Pending the final application of any such Net Cash Proceeds, the Issuer may temporarily reduce revolving

<<<

 credit borrowings or otherwise invest such Net Cash Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the terms of the Senior Secured Indenture.
On the 366th day after an Asset Disposition, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds

<<<

 SEK100.0 million, the Issuer will be required within 10 Business Days thereof to make an offer ("Asset Disposition Offer") to all Holders and, to the extent the Issuer elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to

<<<

 purchase the maximum principal amount of Senior Secured Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Senior Secured

<<<

 Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the case of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than) 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes and 100% of the principal amount of Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case

<<<

, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Senior Secured Indenture or the agreements governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, in minimum

<<<

 denominations of 100,000 or SEK 1,000,000 (as applicable) and in integral multiples of 1,000 or SEK 10,000 in excess thereof (as applicable).
To the extent that the aggregate amount of Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly

<<<

 tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to other covenants contained in the Senior

<<<

 Secured Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of

<<<

 Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Senior Secured Notes and Pari

<<<

 Passu Indebtedness. For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such Indebtedness not denominated in SEK, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal amounts into their SEK Equivalent determined as

<<<

 of a date selected by the Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period (as defined below). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.
To the extent that any portion of Net

<<<

 Available Cash payable in respect of the Senior Secured Notes is denominated in a currency other than the currency in which the relevant Senior Secured Notes are denominated, the amount thereof payable in respect of such Senior Secured Notes

<<<

 shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in which such Senior Secured Notes are denominated that is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion of the Net Available Cash into such currency.
The Asset Disposition

<<<

 Offer, in so far as it relates to the Senior Secured Notes, will remain open for a period of not less than 20 Business Days following its commencement (the "Asset Disposition Offer Period"). No later than five Business Days after the termination

<<<

 of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the "Asset Disposition Purchase Date"), the Issuer will purchase the principal amount of Senior Secured Notes and, to the extent it elects, Pari Passu Indebtedness required to be purchased by it pursuant

<<<

 to this covenant (the "Asset Disposition Offer Amount") or, if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition

<<<

 Offer.
On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness

<<<

 or portions of Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not properly

<<<

 withdrawn, all Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and in minimum denominations of 100,000 or SEK 1,000,000 and in integral multiples of 1,000 or SEK 10,000 in excess thereof (as applicable

<<<

). The Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate stating that such Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Issuer in accordance with the terms of this covenant. The Issuer or the Paying Agent

<<<

, as the case may be, will promptly (but in any case not later than five Business Days after termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver to each tendering Holder an amount equal to the purchase price of the Senior Secured

<<<

 Notes so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn by such Holder, and accepted by the Issuer for purchase, and the Issuer will promptly issue a new Senior Secured Note (or amend the applicable Global Note), and the Trustee (or an authenticating

<<<

 agent), upon delivery of an Officer's Certificate from the Issuer, will authenticate and mail or deliver (or cause to be transferred by book entry) such new Senior Secured Note to such Holder, in a principal amount equal to any unpurchased

<<<

 portion of the Senior Secured Note surrendered; provided that each such new Senior Secured Note will be in a principal amount with a minimum denomination of 100,000. Any Senior Secured Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered

<<<

 (or transferred by book entry) by the Issuer to the Holder thereof.
The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with

<<<

 the repurchase of Senior Secured Notes pursuant to the Senior Secured Indenture. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the
143

Issuer will comply with the applicable

<<<

 securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Senior Secured Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

Limitation on Affiliate Transactions

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of

<<<

 its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter into or conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate

<<<

 of the Issuer (any such transaction or series of related transactions being an "Affiliate Transaction") involving aggregate value in excess of SEK50.0 million unless:

(1)

the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially

<<<

 less favorable to the Issuer or

such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable

transaction on an arm's-length basis at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement

providing

<<<

 for such transaction in arm's-length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate;

(2)

in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of SEK150.0 million, the

terms of such transaction or series of related

<<<

 transactions have been approved by a resolution of the

majority of the disinterested members of the Board of Directors of the Issuer resolving that such transaction

complies with clause (1) above; and

(3)

in the event such Affiliate Transaction

<<<

 involves an aggregate consideration in excess of SEK250.0 million,

the Issuer has received a written opinion (a "Fairness Opinion") from an Independent Financial Advisor

that such Affiliate Transaction is fair, from a financial standpoint

<<<

, to the Issuer and its Restricted

Subsidiaries or that the terms are not materially less favorable than those that could reasonably have been

obtained in a comparable transaction at such time on an arm's-length basis from a Person that is

<<<

 not an

Affiliate.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1)

any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under "--Limitation on

Restricted Payments," any Permitted Payments (other

<<<

 than pursuant to clause (9)(b)(ii) of the fourth

including

<<<

 through any Person owned or controlled by any of such directors, officers or employees);

(6)

(i) the Refinancing, (ii) the entry into and performance of obligations of the Issuer or any of its Restricted

Subsidiaries under the terms of any

 transaction pursuant to or contemplated by, and any payments pursuant

to or for purposes of funding, any agreement or instrument in effect as of or on the Issue Date, as described

in "Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions,

<<<

" in the Offering Memorandum, as these

agreements and instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed, replaced or

 more

disadvantageous to the Holders in any material respect, and (iii) the entry into and performance of any

 than those that could reasonably have been obtained at such

time from an unaffiliated party;

(9)

any transaction in the ordinary course of business between or among the Issuer or any Restricted

Subsidiary and any Affiliate (other than an

 Unrestricted Subsidiary) of the Issuer or an Associate or similar

In addition, the Issuer shall furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request of such parties, any information required to be delivered pursuant

The Issuer shall also make available to Holders

 and prospective holders of the Senior Secured Notes copies of all reports furnished to the Trustee on the Issuer's website.

All financial statement information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect on the date of such report

<<<

 EBITDA for the most recent four quarters for which annual or quarterly financial reports have been delivered to the Trustee or (b) consolidated assets as of the last day of the most recent quarter for which annual or quarterly financial reports

At any time that any of the Issuer's subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted Subsidiary or a group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant Subsidiary

<<<

 of the Issuer, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the first paragraph of this "Reports to Holders" covenant will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the

<<<

 footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer. For purposes

<<<

 of this covenant and any calculation to be made under the Senior Secured Indenture, the Issuer may use financial statements of Bravida AB with respect to periods commencing prior to the Issue Date.

All reports provided pursuant to this "Reports

<<<

" covenant shall be made in the English language.

In the event that (i) the Issuer becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues

<<<

 to file the reports required by Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) the Issuer elects to provide to the Trustee reports which, if filed with the SEC, would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Issuer) the reporting requirements of Section

<<<

 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the provision of U.S. GAAP information, certifications, exhibits or information as to internal controls and procedures), for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make available to the Trustee

<<<

 such annual reports, information, documents and other reports that the Issuer is, or would be,

146

required to file with the SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d). Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the Issuer will be deemed

<<<

 to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

Merger and Consolidation

The Issuer

The Issuer will not, directly or indirectly, consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise

<<<

 dispose all or substantially all its assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions to, any Person, unless:

(1)

either the Issuer is the surviving entity or the resulting, surviving

<<<

 or transferee Person (the "Successor

Company") will be a Person organized and existing under the laws of any member state of the European

Union, any State of the United States of America or the District of Columbia, Canada or any province

<<<

 of

Canada, Norway or Switzerland and the Successor Company (if not the Issuer) will expressly assume,

(a) by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form reasonably satisfactory to the

Trustee, all the obligations

<<<

 of the Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Indenture

and (b) all obligations of the Issuer under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor

Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable;

(2)

<<<



immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an

obligation of the Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the Successor Company as a result of such

transaction as having been Incurred by

<<<

 the Successor Company or such Subsidiary at the time of such

transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3)

immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Issuer or the Successor

<<<

 Company would

be able to Incur at least an additional SEK1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the

covenant described under "--Limitation on Indebtedness" or (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the

Issuer or the Successor

<<<

 Company for the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which financial

statements are available immediately preceding the date on which the transaction is consummated would

not be less than it was immediately prior to giving effect

<<<

 to such transaction; and

(4)

the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each to

the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply

<<<

 with

the Senior Secured Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental indenture (if

any) has been duly authorized, executed and delivered and is a legal, valid and binding agreement

enforceable against the Successor

<<<

 Company (in each case, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to

the Trustee), provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer's Certificate as

to any matters of fact.

Any Indebtedness that becomes an

<<<

 obligation of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (or that is deemed to be Incurred by any Restricted Subsidiary that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) as a result of any such transaction undertaken in compliance with this covenant, and

<<<

 any Refinancing Indebtedness with respect thereto, shall be deemed to have been Incurred in compliance with the covenant described under "--Limitation on Indebtedness."

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment

<<<

, transfer, or other disposition of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Issuer, which properties and assets, if held by the Issuer instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially

<<<

 all of the properties and assets of the Issuer on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for

<<<

, and may exercise every right and power of, the Issuer under the Senior Secured Indenture but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets, the predecessor company will not be released from its obligations under the Senior

<<<

 Secured Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase "substantially all" under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular

<<<

 transaction would involve "all or substantially all" of the property or assets of a Person.

The Guarantors

No Guarantor (other than a Guarantor whose Notes Guarantee is to be released in accordance with the terms of the Senior Secured Indenture

<<<

, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) may:

(1)

consolidate with or merge with or into any Person (whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving

corporation);

(2)

sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease

<<<

 or otherwise dispose of, all or substantially all its assets as an entirety or

substantially as an entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to any Person; or

147

(3)

permit any Person to merge with or into it unless

<<<

:

A.

the other Person is the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor or becomes a

Guarantor substantially concurrently with such consolidation, merger, sale assignment,

conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposal;

B.


<<<


(1) either (x) a Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting, surviving or transferee

Person expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee and

the Senior Secured Indenture (pursuant to a supplemental

<<<

 indenture executed and delivered in a

form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee) and all obligations of the Guarantor under the

Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents,

as applicable;

<<<

 and (2) immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default or Event of

Default shall have occurred and is continuing; or

C.

the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or

merger

<<<

) of a Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of a

Guarantor (in each case other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted

by the Senior Secured Indenture.

The provisions set forth

<<<

 in this "Merger and Consolidation" covenant shall not restrict (and shall not apply to): (i) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor from consolidating with, merging or liquidating into or transferring all or substantially all of

<<<

 its properties and assets to the Issuer, a Guarantor or any other Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor (provided that a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor and that has Incurred Indebtedness pursuant to clause (5) of the

<<<

 second paragraph of the covenant described above under "--Limitation on Indebtedness" may only merge into or transfer all or substantially all its properties and assets to another such Restricted Subsidiary); (ii) any Guarantor from merging

<<<

 or liquidating into or transferring all or part of its properties and assets to the Issuer or another Guarantor; (iii) any consolidation or merger of the Issuer into any Guarantor; provided that, if the Issuer is not the surviving entity of

<<<

 such merger or consolidation, the relevant Guarantor will assume the obligations of the Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Indenture, the Intercreditor, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents

<<<

 and clauses (1) and (4) under the heading "-- The Issuer" shall apply to such transaction; and (iii) the Issuer or any Guarantor consolidating into or merging or combining with an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing

<<<

 the legal domicile of such entity, reincorporating such entity in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of such entity; provided, however, that clauses (1), (2) and (4) under the heading "--The Issuer" or clause (3) under the heading

<<<

 "--The Guarantors," as the case may be, shall apply to any such transaction.

Limitation to Holding Company Activities

Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Senior Secured Indenture, the Issuer may not carry on any business or own any

<<<

 assets other than:

(1)

the ownership of shares of Bravissima Acquisitions AB or, following Bravissima Acquisitions AB's

merger with and into the Issuer, SIA AB, cash and Cash Equivalents and other properties and assets that

are de minimis

<<<

Suspension of Covenants

<<<

 on Achievement of Investment Grade Status

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a "Suspension Event"), then

<<<

, beginning on that day and continuing until such time, if any, at which the Senior Secured Notes cease to have Investment Grade Status (the "Reversion Date"), the provisions of the Senior Secured Indenture summarized under the following captions

<<<

 will not apply to the Senior Secured Notes:

(1)

"--Limitation on Restricted Payments";

(2)

"--Limitation on Indebtedness";

(3)

"--Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries";

(4)

"--Limitation on Affiliate

<<<

 Transactions";

(5)

"--Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock";

(6)

"--Additional Guarantees"; and

(7)

the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under "--Merger and

Consolidation--The Issuer

<<<

,"

and, in each case, any related default provision of the Senior Secured Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be applicable to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

Such covenants and any related default provisions will

<<<

 again apply according to their terms from the first day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard to actions of the Issuer properly taken during the continuance of the

<<<

 Suspension Event, and no action taken prior to the Reversion Date will constitute a Default or Event of Default. The "Limitation on Restricted Payments" covenant will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of the Senior Secured

<<<

 Indenture but not during the continuance of the Suspension Event. On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified

<<<

 as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under "--Limitation on Indebtedness." In addition, the Senior Secured Indenture will also permit, without causing a Default or Event of Default, the Issuer or

<<<

 any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to honor any contractual commitments or take actions in the future after any date on which the Senior Secured Notes cease to have an Investment Grade Status as long as the contractual commitments were entered

<<<

 into during the Suspension Event and not in anticipation of the Senior Secured Notes no longer having an Investment Grade Status. The Issuer shall notify the Trustee that the conditions set forth in the first paragraph under this caption has

<<<

 been satisfied, provided that, no such notification shall be a condition for the suspension of the covenants described under this caption to be effective. There can be no assurance that the Senior Secured Notes will ever achieve or maintain

<<<

 an Investment Grade Status.

Impairment of Security Interest

The Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or knowingly or negligently omit to take any action that would have the result of materially impairing

<<<

 the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood, subject to the proviso below, that the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the Security Interest with

<<<

 respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and the Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the

<<<

 Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral, except that (i) the Issuer and its Restricted

<<<

 Subsidiaries may Incur Permitted Collateral Liens and the Collateral may be discharged and released in accordance with the Senior Secured Indenture, the applicable Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor

<<<

 Agreement and (ii) the applicable Security Documents may be amended from time to time to cure any ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect, manifest error or inconsistency therein; provided, however, that in the case of clause (i) above, except

<<<

 with respect to any discharge or release in accordance with the Senior Secured Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents may not be amended, extended, renewed, restated,
149


<<<


supplemented, released or otherwise modified or replaced, unless contemporaneously with any such action, the Issuer delivers to the Trustee, either (1) a solvency opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee from an

<<<

 Independent Financial Advisor confirming the solvency of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification

<<<

 or replacement, (2) a certificate from the Board of Directors of the relevant Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, which confirms the solvency of the person granting such Security Interest, after giving effect

<<<

 to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement, or (3) an Opinion of Counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, confirming that, after giving

<<<

 effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the Security Documents, so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified

<<<

 or replaced are valid Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement

<<<

, supplement, modification or replacement. In the event that the Issuer complies with the requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to each of the Trustee and the Security Agent being indemnified and secured

<<<

 to its satisfaction, including by way of prefunding) consent to such amendments without the need for instructions from the Holders.
Additional Guarantees
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this covenant, no Restricted Subsidiary shall

<<<

 Guarantee the Indebtedness outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, any Credit Facility or any other Public Debt, in each case of the Issuer or a Guarantor unless such Restricted Subsidiary is or becomes a Guarantor on the date on which

<<<

 the Notes Guarantee is Incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Senior Secured Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Notes Guarantee

<<<

; provided, however, that such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be obligated to become such a Guarantor to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Notes Guarantee could give rise to or result in: (1) any breach or violation of statutory

<<<

 limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable

<<<

 jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership

<<<

, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out of pocket expenses. At the option of the Issuer, any Notes Guarantee

<<<

 may contain limitations on Guarantor liability to the extent reasonably necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial

<<<

 assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.
Future Notes Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision

<<<

 shall be released as set forth under "--Releases of the Note Guarantees." A Notes Guarantee of a future Guarantor may also be released at the option of the Issuer if at the date of such release there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding

<<<

 which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Senior Secured Indenture if such Guarantor had not been designated as a Guarantor. The Trustee and the Security Agent shall each take all

<<<

 necessary actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Notes Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to each

<<<

 of the Trustee and the Security Agent being indemnified and secured to its satisfaction, including by way of prefunding.
The validity and enforceability of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests and the liability of

<<<

 each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations as described and set out in "Risk Factors."
Additional Intercreditor Agreements
The Senior Secured Indenture provides that, at the request of the Issuer, in connection with the Incurrence by

<<<

 the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries of any (1) Indebtedness permitted pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under "-- Limitation on Indebtedness" or clause (1), (4), (5), (6), (7) (other than with respect to Capitalized

<<<

 Lease Obligations), (11) or (13) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under "--Limitation on Indebtedness" and (2) any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of Indebtedness referred to in the foregoing clause (1), the Issuer, the

<<<

 relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized Representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an "Additional Intercreditor Agreement") or a

<<<

 restatement, amendment or other modification of the existing Intercreditor Agreement on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable to the Holders), including containing substantially

<<<

 the same terms with respect to release of Guarantees and priority and release of the Security Interests; provided that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in

<<<

 the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee or Security Agent under the Senior Secured Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement.
The Senior Secured

<<<

 Indenture also provides that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of Holders, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity

<<<

, omission, defect, manifest error or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to
150

<<<



any such agreement (including with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes), (3)

<<<

 add Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the Senior Secured Notes (including Additional Senior Secured Notes), (5) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of

<<<

 the Collateral to secure Additional Senior Secured Notes, (6) implement any Permitted Collateral Liens, (7) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof or (8) make any other

<<<

 change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect. In formulating its opinion on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to request and rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems appropriate

<<<

, including an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel. The Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the Holders of the majority

<<<

 in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below under "--Amendments and Waivers," and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any amendment

<<<

 to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under the

<<<

 Senior Secured Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Senior Secured Indenture also provides that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee

<<<

 (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the Holders to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations subordinated to the Senior Secured Notes thereby

<<<

; provided, however, that such transaction would comply with the covenant described under "--Limitation on Restricted Payments."

The Senior Secured Indenture also provides that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed

<<<

 to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein) and to have directed the

<<<

 Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement. A copy of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement shall be made available for inspection during normal business hours on

<<<

 any Business Day upon prior written request at our offices.

Events of Default

Each of the following is an "Event of Default" under the Senior Secured Indenture:

(1)

default in any payment of interest on any Senior Secured Note issued under

<<<

 the Senior Secured Indenture

when due and payable, continued for 30 days;

(2)

default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Senior Secured Note issued

under the Senior Secured Indenture when due at its Stated

<<<

 Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon

required repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise;

(3)

failure by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to comply for 60 days after notice by the Trustee

or the Holders of at least 2

<<<

5% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes with its other agreements

contained in the Senior Secured Indenture;

(4)

default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there

may be secured

<<<

 or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted

Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries)

other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or

<<<

 a Restricted Subsidiary whether such Indebtedness or

Guarantee now exists, or is created after the Issue Date, which default:

(a)

is caused by a failure to pay principal at stated maturity on such Indebtedness, immediately

upon the expiration

<<<

 of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness ("payment default"); or

(b)

results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the "cross acceleration

provision"),

and, in each case, either (i) the principal amount

<<<

 of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates SEK200.0 million or more or (ii) such Indebtedness

<<<

 is secured by a Permitted Collateral Lien and Incurred pursuant to clause (1) or (6) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under "--Certain Covenants--Limitation on Indebtedness" secured by Collateral that is accorded super senior

<<<

 priority status with respect to proceeds of enforcement of Collateral under the Intercreditor Agreement, and (A) the 30 day consultation period under the Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the enforcement of such Indebtedness has expired

<<<

, (B) certain insolvency events have occurred or (C) the consultation period under the Intercreditor Agreement does not apply because the Senior Secured Creditors (as defined therein) have determined in good faith that to enter into consultation

<<<

 could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent's ability to enforce any of the

151

Collateral or the realization of proceeds thereof and have instructed the Security Agent as to the enforcement of the

<<<

 Collateral;

(5)

certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary or

group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial

statements

<<<

 for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary (the

"bankruptcy provisions");

(6)

failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together



<<<

(as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries),

would constitute a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of

SEK100.0 million (exclusive of any amounts

<<<

 that a solvent insurance company has acknowledged liability

for), which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after the judgment

becomes final (the "judgment default provision");

(7)

any security interest

<<<

 under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect

(other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement,

any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the

<<<

 Senior Secured Indenture) with respect to Collateral having

a fair market value in excess of SEK50.0 million for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all

obligations under the Senior Secured Indenture or the release of any such

<<<

 security interest in accordance

with the terms of the Senior Secured Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor

Agreement or the Security Documents or any such security interest created thereunder shall be declared

<<<



invalid or unenforceable or the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall assert in writing that any such

security interest is invalid or unenforceable and any such Default continues for 10 days; and

(8)

any Notes Guarantee of a Significant

<<<

 Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in

accordance with the terms of such Guarantee or the Senior Secured Indenture) or is declared invalid or

unenforceable in a judicial proceeding or any Guarantor denies or disaffirms

<<<

 in writing its obligations

under its Notes Guarantee and any such Default continues for 10 days.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the

<<<

 Issuer or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Senior Secured Indenture by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal

<<<

 of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Senior Secured Notes under the Senior Secured Indenture to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest will be due and

<<<

 payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (4) under the definition of "--Events of Default" has occurred and is continuing, the declaration

<<<

 of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness

<<<

, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes

<<<

 would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest on the Senior Secured Notes that became due solely because of the

<<<

 acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes, have been cured or waived.

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Senior Secured

<<<

 Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.

Holders of the Senior Secured Notes may not enforce the Senior Secured Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes

<<<

 except as provided in the Senior Secured Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Holders of a majority

<<<

 in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Senior Secured Indenture by notice to the Trustee may, on behalf of all Holders, waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal

<<<

, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

Subject

<<<

 to the provisions of the Senior Secured Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Senior Secured

<<<

 Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity or security (including by way of prefunding) satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to

<<<

 enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Senior Secured Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes unless:

(1)

such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice

<<<

 that an Event of Default is continuing;

152

(2)

Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue

the remedy;

(3)

such Holders have offered the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory

<<<

 to it against any loss, liability or

expense;

(4)

the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer

of such security or indemnity; and

(5)

the Holders of a majority in principal

<<<

 amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a

direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal

<<<

 amount of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.

The Senior Secured

<<<

 Indenture provides that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs

<<<

. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Senior Secured Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal

<<<

 liability. Prior to taking any action under the Senior Secured Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification or security (including by way of prefunding) satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses and expenses

<<<

 caused by taking or not taking such action. Prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Trustee will have no obligation to monitor compliance by the Issuer with the Senior Secured Indenture. The Senior Secured Indenture will provide

<<<

 that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default

<<<

 in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Senior Secured Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required

<<<

 to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer's Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is required

<<<

 to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect

<<<

 thereof.

The Senior Secured Indenture provides that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (an "Initial Default") then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default

<<<

 for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed

<<<

 in the covenant entitled "--Certain Covenants--Reports" or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of this Senior Secured Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required

<<<

 by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Senior Secured Indenture.

The Senior Secured Indenture provides for the Trustee to take action on behalf

<<<

 of the Holders in certain circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified or secured to its satisfaction (including by way of prefunding). It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Senior Secured

<<<

 Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly.

Amendments and Waivers

Subject to certain exceptions

<<<

, the Senior Secured Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection

<<<

 with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Senior Secured Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority

<<<

 in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Senior Secured Notes). However, without the consent of Holders holding not

<<<

 less than 90% (or, in the case of clause (8), 75%) of the then outstanding principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes affected, then outstanding, an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any Senior Secured Notes held by a non-consenting

<<<

 Holder:

(1)

reduce the principal amount of Senior Secured Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment,

waiver or modification;

(2)

reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any Senior Secured Note

<<<

;

(3)

reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Senior Secured Note;

(4)

reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Senior Secured Note or change the time at which

any Senior Secured Note may be redeemed, in

<<<

 each case as described under "--Optional Redemption";

153

(5)

make any Senior Secured Note payable in money other than that stated in the Senior Secured Note;

(6)

impair the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest

<<<

 or Additional Amounts, if

any, on such Holder's Senior Secured Notes on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the

enforcement of any such payment on or with respect to such Holder's Senior Secured Notes;

(7)

make any

<<<

 change in the provision of the Senior Secured Indenture described under "--Withholding Taxes"

that adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Senior Secured Notes in any material respect or

amends the terms of such Senior Secured Notes

<<<

 in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from

any of the Taxes described thereunder or an exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so

described thereunder unless the Issuer agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if

<<<

 any, in respect thereof;

(8)

release any security interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral other than in

accordance with the terms of the Notes Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement, any applicable

Additional

<<<

 Intercreditor Agreement or the Senior Secured Indenture;

(9)

waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or interest or

Additional Amounts, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes (except pursuant

<<<

 to a rescission of acceleration of

the Senior Secured Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Senior

Secured Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);

(10)

<<<

 release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Notes Guarantee or the Senior Secured Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of the Senior Secured Indenture and the Intercreditor agreement; or

(11) make any change in the

<<<

 amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders' consent described in this sentence,

provided, however, that if such amendment of waiver described in clauses (2), (3) and (4) above only affects or would only affect Holders of one

<<<

 or more series of Senior Secured Notes, and does not or would not affect Holders of the Senior Secured Notes generally, only the consent of the Holders of not less than 90% of the then outstanding principal amount of the relevant series of

<<<

 Senior Secured Notes shall be required.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Security Agent and the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Senior Secured

<<<

 Notes Documents to:

(1)

cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, manifest error or inconsistency;

(2)

provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or any Restricted

Subsidiary under any Senior Secured

<<<

 Notes Document;

(3)

add to the covenants or provide for a Notes Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any right

or power conferred upon the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4)

make any change that would provide additional

<<<

 rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders or that does

not adversely affect the rights or benefits to the Trustee or any of the Holders in any material respect under

the Senior Secured Notes Documents;

(5)

make such provisions as

<<<

 necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a member of

Senior Management of the Issuer) for the issuance of Additional Senior Secured Notes;

(6)

to provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Notes Guarantee

<<<

Secured Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any Notes

Guarantee or Lien (including the Collateral and the Security Documents) or any amendment in respect

<<<

 Secured Indenture or the

Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor Trustee or Security

Agent pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee or Security Agent

of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders or parties to the Revolving Credit

<<<

 Facility, in any

property which is required by the Security Documents or the Revolving Credit Facility (as in effect on the

Issue Date) to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a security interest is required to be

granted to

<<<

 the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a security interest in the Collateral for the

benefit of any Person; provided that the granting of such security interest is not prohibited by the Senior

Secured Indenture or the Intercreditor

<<<

 Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the

covenant described under "--Certain Covenants--Impairment of Security Interest" is complied with; or

(10) as provided in "--Certain Covenants--Additional Intercreditor Agreements

<<<

."

In formulating its decision on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to require and rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems necessary, including Officer's Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not

<<<

 necessary under the Senior Secured Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment of any Senior Secured Notes Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment. A consent to any

<<<

 amendment or waiver under the Senior Secured Indenture by any Holder of Notes given in connection with a tender of such Holder's Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

Acts by Holders

In determining whether the Holders of the

<<<

 required principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes have concurred in any direction, waiver or consent, the Senior Secured Notes owned by the Issuer or by any Person directly or indirectly controlled, or controlled by, or under direct or

<<<

 indirect common control with, the Issuer will be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding.

Defeasance

The Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Issuer and each Guarantor under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior

<<<

 Secured Indenture ("legal defeasance") and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities

<<<

 of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning issuing temporary Senior Secured Notes, registration of Senior Secured Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Senior Secured Notes and

<<<

 the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the Notes Security Documents and the rights of the Trustee and

<<<

 the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time will terminate (other than with respect to the defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate its and the Guarantors' obligations

<<<

 under the covenants described under "Certain Covenants" (other than clauses (1) and (2) under each of "--Certain Covenants--Merger and Consolidation--The Issuer") and "Change of Control" and the default provisions relating to such covenants

<<<

 described under "Events of Default" above, the operation of the cross-default upon a payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to the Issuer and the Significant Subsidiaries, the judgment default

<<<

 provision, the guarantee provision and the security default provision described under "--Events of Default" ("covenant defeasance").

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise

<<<

 of its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Senior Secured Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to such Senior Secured Notes. If the Issuer exercises

<<<

 its covenant defeasance option with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, payment of the Senior Secured Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3) (other than with respect to clauses (1) and (2) of the

<<<

 covenants described under "-- Certain Covenants--Merger and Consolidation--The Issuer", (4), (5) (with respect only to the Significant Subsidiaries), (6), (7) or (8) under "--Events of Default."

In order to exercise either defeasance option

<<<

, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the "defeasance trust") with the Trustee (or another entity designated by the Trustee for this purpose) cash in euros or euro-denominated European Government Obligations or a combination thereof

<<<

 sufficient for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Senior Secured Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1)

an

<<<

 Opinion of Counsel in the United States to the effect that Holders of the relevant Senior Secured Notes

will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and

defeasance and will be subject

<<<

 to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and

at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and in the

case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel in the

<<<

 United States must be based on a ruling

received by the Issuer from, or published by, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other change in

applicable U.S. federal income tax law);

(2)

an Officer's Certificate stating that the deposit was

<<<

 not made by the Issuer with the intent of defeating,

hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer;

155

(3)

an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to customary

<<<



assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or relating to legal

defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with;

(4)

an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the trust

<<<

 resulting from the deposit does not constitute, or is

qualified as, a regulated investment company under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940; and

(5)

the Issuer delivers to the Trustee all other documents or other information that the

<<<

 Trustee may reasonably

require in connection with either defeasance option.

Satisfaction and Discharge

The Senior Secured Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor

<<<

 Agreement and the Security Documents will be discharged and cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of conversion or transfer or exchange of the Senior Secured Notes, as expressly provided for in the Senior Secured Indenture

<<<

) as to all outstanding Senior Secured Notes when (1) either (a) all the Senior Secured Notes previously authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Senior Secured Notes, and certain Senior Secured Notes for which

<<<

 provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Issuer) have been delivered to the Principal Paying Agent for cancellation; or (b) all Senior Secured Notes not previously delivered to the Principal

<<<

 Paying Agent for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to

<<<

 the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Principal Paying Agent in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the Issuer has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or another entity designated by the Trustee

<<<

 for this purpose), money or eurodenominated European Government Obligations, or a combination thereof, as applicable, in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Senior Secured Notes not previously delivered

<<<

 to the Principal Paying Agent for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Senior Secured Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the

<<<

 case may be; (3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the Senior Secured Indenture; and (4) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each to the effect that

<<<

 all conditions precedent under the "Satisfaction and Discharge" section of the Senior Secured Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Secured Indenture have been complied with, provided that any such counsel may rely

<<<

 on any Officer's Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)).

No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders

No director, officer, employee, incorporator

<<<

 or shareholder of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer, Issuer or any Guarantor under the Senior Secured Notes Documents or for any claim based on, in respect

<<<

 of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Senior Secured Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Senior Secured Notes. Such

<<<

 waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents

Deutsche Trustee Company Limited

<<<

 is appointed as Trustee under the Senior Secured Indenture. The Senior Secured Indenture provides that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in the Senior

<<<

 Secured Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Senior Secured Indenture and use the same degree of care that a prudent Person would use in conducting

<<<

 its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Senior Secured Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty.

The Senior Secured Indenture imposes certain limitations

<<<

 on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of the Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee or any Agent

<<<

 will be permitted to engage in other transactions with the Issuer and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries. If the Trustee or any Agent becomes the Holder, beneficial owner or pledgee of any Notes, it may deal with the Issuer with the same rights

<<<

 it would have if it were not the Trustee, Paying Agent or any other such Agent.

The Senior Secured Indenture sets out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and replaced. Such terms will include, among others, (1) that

<<<

 the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Issuer and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires

<<<

 a conflict of interest that is not eliminated, or (b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less than six months

<<<

 may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee.

156

The Senior

<<<

 Secured Indenture contains provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, Taxes or expenses Incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance

<<<

 or administration of the Senior Secured Indenture.
Prescription
Claims against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of principal, or premium, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes will be prescribed ten years after the applicable due

<<<

 date for payment thereof. Claims against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of interest on the Senior Secured Notes will be prescribed six years after the applicable due date for payment of interest.
Currency Indemnity and Calculation

<<<

 of SEK-Denominated Restrictions
The euro and SEK are the sole currencies of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the Guarantors, if any, under or in connection with the Senior Secured Notes and the Notes Guarantees including

<<<

 damages. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than euro (in the case of the EUR Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes) or SEK (in the case of the SEK Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes), whether as a result of, or the enforcement

<<<

 of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Guarantor or otherwise by any Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or a Guarantor

<<<

 will only constitute a discharge to the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of the euro amount or the SEK amount (as applicable) which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other

<<<

 currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is practicable to do so).
If that euro or SEK amount is less than the euro or SEK amount expressed

<<<

 to be due to the recipient or the Trustee under any Senior Secured Note (as applicable), the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss sustained by such recipient or the Trustee as a result. In any event, the Issuer and

<<<

 the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient or the Trustee on a joint or several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated

<<<

 therein for the Holder of a Senior Secured Note or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer (indicating the sources of information used) the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute

<<<

 a separate and independent obligation from the Issuer's and the Guarantors' other obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Senior Secured Note

<<<

 or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Senior Secured Note

<<<

 or any Note Guarantee, or to the Trustee.
Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any SEK-denominated restriction herein, the SEK Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated

<<<

 in a currency other than SEK shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such non-SEK amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM
General

<<<


Notes sold in connection with the Issue are represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (collectively, the "Global Notes"). The Global Notes are deposited with, or on behalf of, the common depositary

<<<

 (the "Common Depositary") for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream and registered in the name of the nominee of the Common Depositary.
Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (the "Book-Entry Interests") is limited to persons that have

<<<

 accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream, or persons that hold interests through such participants or otherwise in accordance with applicable transfer restrictions set forth in the Indenture and any applicable securities laws of any state

<<<

 of the United States or any other jurisdiction. Euroclear and Clearstream hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers' securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositaries

<<<

. Except under limited circumstances, owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes are not entitled to receive physical delivery of certificated Notes.
Book-Entry Interests are shown on, and transfers thereof are done only through, records

<<<

 maintained in book-entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their respective participants. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery

<<<

 of such securities in definitive certificated form. The foregoing limitations may impair your ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests are not

<<<

 considered the owners or "holders" of Notes for any purpose.
So long as the Notes are held in global form, Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or their respective nominees), as applicable, are considered the sole holders of Global Notes for all purposes

<<<

 under the Indenture. In addition, participants in Euroclear and/or Clearstream must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as the case may be, and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear, Clearstream

<<<

 and the participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders under the Indenture.
Neither we nor the Trustee nor any of our or its respective agents and neither the Registrar

<<<

 nor the Transfer Agent have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.
Redemption of the Global Notes
In the event any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and

<<<

/or Clearstream (or their respective nominees), as applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The Common Depositary

<<<

 will surrender such Global Note to the Registrar for cancellation or, in the case of a partial redemption, the Common Depositary will request the Registrar or the Paying Agent to mark down, endorse and return the applicable Global Note to reflect

<<<

 the reduction in the principal amount of such Global Note as a result of such partial redemption. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear

<<<

 and Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). If less than all of any series of Notes is to be redeemed at any time, the Principal Paying Agent or the Registrar will select Notes

<<<

 for redemption on a pro rata basis (or, in the case of Notes issued in global form as discussed under "Book-Entry, Delivery and Form," based on a method that most nearly approximates a pro rata selection as the Principal Paying Agent or the

<<<

 Registrar deems fair and appropriate), unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange or depository requirements.
Payments on Global Notes
We make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal

<<<

, premium, if any, interest and additional interest, if any) to the Paying Agent, who makes payments as directed by the Common Depositary to Euroclear and Clearstream, which distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their customary

<<<

 procedures. We make payments of all such amounts without deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature, except as may be required by law and as described

<<<

 under "Description of the Senior Secured Notes--Withholding Taxes." If any such deduction or withholding is required to be made, then, to the extent described under "Description of the Senior Secured Notes--Withholding Taxes," we pay additional

<<<

 amounts as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by any holder of the Global Notes or owner of Book-Entry Interests after such deduction or withholding equal the net amounts that such holder or owner would have otherwise received

<<<

 in respect of such Global Note or Book-Entry Interest, as the case may be, absent such withholding or deduction. We expect that standing customer instructions and customary practices govern payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests

<<<

 held through such participants.
Under the terms of the Indenture, we, the agents and the Trustee treat the registered holders of the Global Notes (i.e., the nominee for the Common Depositary for Euroclear or Clearstream) as the owners thereof

<<<

 for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, neither we, the agents, the Trustee, nor any of our or its respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:
· any aspect of the records of

<<<

 Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of
184

Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant

<<<

 or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest; or
· Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant.
Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants

<<<

 are the responsibility of such participants.
Currency of Payment for the Global Notes
Except as may otherwise be agreed between Euroclear and/or Clearstream and any holder, the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts

<<<

 payable in respect of the SEK Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes are paid to holders of interests in such Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in Swedish kronor.
Payments are subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations

<<<

 (including any regulations of the applicable clearing system) applicable thereto. None of us, the agents or the Trustee or the Initial Purchasers nor any of our or their respective agents will be liable to any holder of a Global Note or any

<<<

 other person for any commissions, costs, losses or expenses in relation to or resulting from any currency conversion or rounding effected in connection with any such payment.
Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests
Euroclear and Clearstream

<<<

 have advised us that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of Notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such

<<<

 portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking

<<<

 of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default under the Notes, each of Euroclear and Clearstream reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for definitive registered Notes in certificated

<<<

 form (the "Definitive Registered Notes"), and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to its participants.
Transfers
Transfers of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the applicable rules and procedures of Euroclear

<<<

 and Clearstream and their respective direct or indirect participants, which rules and procedures may change from time to time. Further, the Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act

<<<

 or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. The Notes are subject to restrictions on transfer and may only be offered or sold in transactions that are exempt from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act. See "Important

<<<

 information."
Following the Issue Date, we intend to make an application to also list the SEK Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes on NASDAQ OMX Stockholm. Application has also been made to list the Notes on the Official List of the Irish Stock

<<<

 Exchange and for the Notes to be admitted to trading on the Global Exchange Market thereof and trading has commenced on October 22, 2013. Accordingly, the SEK Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes will be listed both on the Irish Stock Exchange

<<<

 and on NASDAQ OMX Stockholm, subject to acceptance of the application to list the SEK Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes on NASDAQ OMX Stockholm for which there can be no assurance. Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants

<<<

 in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures, which rules and operating procedures may change from time to time.
Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently

<<<

 follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures

<<<

, and such procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent or any of our or their respective agents will have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear or Clearstream or their

<<<

 respective participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.
Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book-Entry System
Secondary Market Trading
The Book-Entry

<<<

 Interests trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and settle in same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the

<<<

 purchaser's and the seller's accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.
Special Timing Considerations
You should be aware that investors are only able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other

<<<

 communications involving Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those systems are open for business.
185

Clearing Information The Notes have been accepted for clearance through the facilities of Euroclear and Clearstream. The

<<<

 international
securities identification numbers, common codes and CUSIP numbers for the Notes are set forth under "Listing and General Information--Clearing Information." Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream
The following description

<<<

 of the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream are provided solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement systems and are subject to change by them

<<<

. Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers take any responsibility for these operations and procedures and we urge investors to contact the systems or their participants directly to discuss these matters.
We understand as follows with respect to

<<<

 Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book

<<<

-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded

<<<

 securities. Euroclear and Clearstream also interface with domestic securities markets in several countries. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust

<<<

 companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear or Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear

<<<

 or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Euroclear and Clearstream have no record of or relationship with persons holding through their account holders. Since Euroclear and Clearstream only act on behalf of participants, who

<<<

 in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise

<<<

 take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. We understand that, under existing industry practices, if either the Issuer or the Trustee requests any action by owners of Book

<<<

-Entry Interests or if an owner of a Book-Entry Interest desires to give or take any action that a holder is entitled to give or take under the Indenture, Euroclear and Clearstream would authorize participants owning the relevant Book-Entry

<<<

 Interest to give or take such action, and such participants would authorize indirect participants to give or take such action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of such indirect participants.

CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS IN SWEDEN

<<<


Swedish Taxation
The following summary outlines certain Swedish tax consequences relating to holders of the SEK Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes that are considered to be Swedish residents for Swedish tax purposes (if not otherwise stated

<<<

) and to payments by a Guarantor under the Note Guarantees in respect of the SEK Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes. The summary is based on Swedish legislation currently in effect and is intended to provide general information only. The summary

<<<

 is not exhaustive and does thus not address all potential aspects of Swedish taxation that may be relevant for a potential investor in the SEK Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes and is neither intended to be nor should be construed as legal

<<<

 or tax advice. For instance, the summary does not cover tax issues for holders of EUR Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes or tax issues in cases where SEK Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes are held as current assets in business operations or

<<<

 by a partnership. Furthermore, the summary does not address situations where SEK Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes are held in an investment savings account (investeringssparkonto) or the special rules that may be applicable to private individuals

<<<

 who make or reverse a so-called investor deduction (investeraravdrag). The tax consequences for investors depend in part on their particular circumstances. Specific tax rules apply to certain categories of investors, e.g., life insurance companies

<<<

. Investors should consult professional tax advisors regarding tax consequences of acquiring, owning and disposing of SEK Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes in their particular circumstances.
Holders Resident in Sweden
General
The disposal 

<<<

(including redemption) of a SEK Senior Secured Floating Rate Note is subject to capital gains taxation. The capital gain or the capital loss is computed as the difference between the consideration (less selling expenses) and the tax acquisition

<<<

 value of the SEK Senior Secured Floating Rate Note.
When computing the capital gain or the capital loss, the acquisition value for all SEK Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes of the same class and type shall be added together and computed collectively

<<<

 in accordance with the "average method"(genomsnittsmetoden).
Private Individuals
All capital income such as interest and capital gains on the SEK Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes is taxed in the capital income category for private individuals

<<<

 and estates of deceased persons. The tax rate is 30%. A capital loss on the SEK Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes is deductible at 70% in the same income category, provided the SEK Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes are deemed not to be listed

<<<

 for Swedish tax purposes.
Should a net loss arise in the capital income category a reduction is granted on the tax on income from employment and business operations, as well as national and municipal property tax. This tax reduction is granted

<<<

 with 30% of the net loss that does not exceed SEK100,000 and with 21% of any remaining net loss. An excess net loss cannot be carried forward to future years.
If amounts that are considered to be interest for Swedish tax purposes are paid by

<<<

 a legal entity domiciled in Sweden, including a Swedish branch, to a private individual (or an estate of a deceased person) with residence in Sweden for Swedish tax purposes, Swedish preliminary taxes are normally withheld by the legal entity

<<<

 on such payments. Swedish preliminary taxes are also normally withheld on other returns on the SEK Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes (but not capital gains), if the return is paid out together with interest, as referred to above.
Limited Liability

<<<

 Companies
For limited liability companies (aktiebolag), all income, including interest and capital gains on SEK Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes, is taxed as income from business operations at a rate of 22% (for financial years commencing

<<<

 from January 1, 2013). Deductible capital losses on the SEK Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes may normally be fully off-set in the income from business operations category.
Interest income is generally treated for tax purposes in accordance

<<<

 with the accounting treatment.
Non-resident Investors
Under current Swedish tax law, payment of interest and the repayment of principal by the Issuer under the SEK Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes will be made free of withholding or deduction

<<<

 for or on account of Swedish tax.
Non-resident investors are not taxable in Sweden in respect of the SEK Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes as long as the investor does not have a permanent establishment in Sweden to which the SEK Senior Secured

<<<

 Floating Rate Notes are effectively connected.
187

Payments by a Guarantor For payments by a Guarantor under a Note Guarantee considered to be interest for Swedish tax purposes (and other
returns on SEK Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes

<<<

) to holders of the SEK Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes resident in Sweden for Swedish tax purposes, see "--Holders Resident in Sweden" regarding the tax treatment of holders of the SEK Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes.
For payments by

<<<

 a Guarantor under a Note Guarantee considered to be interest for Swedish tax purposes to holders of the SEK Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes not resident in Sweden for Swedish tax purposes, see "--Non-resident Investors" regarding the tax

<<<

 treatment of holders of the SEK Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes. EU Savings Directive
Under EC Council Directive 2003/48/EC of June 3, 2003 on the taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments (the "EU Savings Directive"),

<<<

 a Member State is required to provide to the tax authorities of another Member State details of payments of interest (or similar income) paid by a paying agent within the jurisdiction of the first Member State to an individual resident, or

<<<

 certain entities established, in that other Member State. However, for a transitional period, Luxembourg and Austria are instead required (unless during that period they elect otherwise) to operate a withholding system in relation to such payments

<<<

. The ending of such transitional period is dependent on the conclusion of certain other agreements relating to information exchange with certain other countries. A number of non-EU countries and territories have adopted similar measures.
The

<<<

 European Commission has proposed certain amendments to the EU Savings Directive, which may, if implemented, amend or broaden the scope of the requirements described above.
