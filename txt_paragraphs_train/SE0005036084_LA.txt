Risk Factors
Investments in corporate bonds always entail a certain degree of risk and this is also the case for an investment in bonds issued by the Company. A number of factors, both within the Company

<<<

's control but also factors not controllable by the Company, affect and may come to affect the Company's profit, financial position and the Notes. The risk factors applicable, both general risks attributable to the Company's operations and risks

<<<

 linked directly to the Notes in their capacity of financial instruments, are described below. The intention is to describe risks that are linked to the Company's business and thus also the Company's ability to fulfil its obligations in accordance

<<<

 with the Terms and Conditions. The below overview of risk factors are not ranked in order of importance.
Before making a decision about acquisition of the Notes, any potential investors should carefully consider the risk factors described below

<<<

, as well as any other provided information about the Company and the Notes. In addition, an investor must, alone or together with its financial and other types of advisers, engage in a general evaluation of external facts, other provided information

<<<

 and general information about the real estate market and real estate companies from its own perspective. An investor should have adequate knowledge to evaluate the risk factors as well as sufficient financial strength to bear these risks.
Additional

<<<

 risk factors which the Company is not currently aware of or that currently is not considered to be material, may also affect the Company's future operations, result and financial position and thus the Company's ability to fulfil its obligations

<<<

 in accordance with the Terms and Conditions.
All risk factors described below may potentially adversely affect the Company's operations, financial position and result. In turn this would affect the Company's ability to fulfil its obligations

<<<

 in accordance with the Terms and Conditions.
Company specific risks
Property values and rental income
The market value of and the rental income from the Company's and the Group's properties is affected by both a number of property-specific

<<<

 factors, such as rent levels, vacancy levels, operating costs, geographical location, infrastructure and environmental effects of the operations and property market factors in general, such as macroeconomic effects, general economic trends

<<<

, growth, unemployment levels, the rate of production of new premises, population growth, inflation and interest rates.
If the market value of the Company's and the Group's properties decreases, a breach of the covenants (such as loan to value

<<<

 covenants) of the loans owed by the Group could occur, which in turn could result in such loans being accelerated prior to maturity and consequently affecting the Group's liquidity. A material decrease of the market value of the properties

<<<

 would also have a negative impact on the Group's possibilities to dispose of its properties without incurring losses and which in turn may have a significantly negative affect on the Company's financial position and result.
2

Refinancing

<<<

 risk
The financial costs could be higher and/or the refinancing possibilities could be limited or nonexistent when the Notes or other debt owed by the Company or the Group falls due and needs to be refinanced. This in turn could affect the

<<<

 Company's and/or the Group's liquidity and consequently affect the possibility to repay debt as it falls due and which in turn may have a significantly negative affect on the Company's financial position and result.
Interest rate risk
Other

<<<

 than equity, the Company's operations are mainly financed by loans from credit institutions. Interest expenses are therefore one of the Company's main cost items. Interest rate risk is defined as the risk that changes in interest rates affect

<<<

 the Company's interest expense. Interest expenses are mainly affected by, besides the extent of interest-bearing debt, the level of current market interest rates, credit institutions' margins and the Company's strategy regarding interest rate

<<<

 fixation periods. The Swedish market for interest rates is mainly affected by the expected inflation rate and The Swedish National Bank's (Sw. Riksbanken) repurchase rate (Sw. reporäntan).
Several of the Company's credit agreements include

<<<

 floating interest rates. The Company uses interest rate derivatives, mainly interest rate swaps, to manage interest rate risk. The interest rate derivatives are reported at fair value in the balance sheet and with changes in value in the profit

<<<

 and loss account. The derivatives implies that the market value of the Company's interest rate derivatives decreases if the market interest rates decrease, which in turn may have a significantly negative affect on the Company's financial position

<<<

 and result.
Technical risks
Real estate investments involve technical risks. A technical risk can be defined as the risk related to the technical operation of the property, such as the risk of defects relating to the construction of the property

<<<

, other latent shortcomings or deficiencies, damages (for instance due to fire or other forces of nature) and environmental hazards. If any technical problems should occur, such occurrence may result in significantly increased costs for the

<<<

 property which in turn may have a significantly negative affect on the Company's financial position and result.
Operating and maintenance costs
Property management is generally associated with costs for operations and maintenance. Unexpected

<<<

 and extensive maintenance and renovation needs on property owned by the Company or the Group or increases in operating costs could have a significantly negative effect on the Company's earnings, cash flows, financial position and result.
Property

<<<

 disposals and acquisitions
The Terms and Conditions do not contain any limitations on the Company's or the Group's possibilities to dispose of its properties or to acquire new properties, other than in respect of the Property. This means that

<<<

 the Group's property portfolio may vary substantially over time and there is also a risk that attractive properties are disposed of whereas less attractive properties may be acquired or not be disposed of, which in turn could result in the

<<<

 market value of the property portfolio of the Group being substantially lower than at present. This could have a negative impact on the market value of the Notes. The disposal by the Group of a majority of its properties could also have a significant

<<<

 negative effect on the Group's cash flow and if such properties are sold at a low price. The disposals could also impact the Group's financial position in general. Additionally,
3

all property transactions involve uncertainties, such as the

<<<

 risks of losing tenants, environmental considerations, legal risks or technical problems.
Counterparty risk
When there is a risk that the Company's counterparties are unable to fulfil their obligations towards the Company, there is a counterparty

<<<

 risk. The Company's current and potential customers may find themselves in a situation due to financial circumstances where they cannot pay the agreed rent as it falls due or otherwise abstain from fulfilling their obligations. In addition

<<<

, counterparty risks within the Company's financial operations arise, inter alia, from the investment of excess liquidity, when derivatives are entered into and upon obtaining long-term and short-term credit agreements. If any counterpart risk

<<<

 arises it may have a significantly negative affect on the Company's financial position and result.
Risk of conflict of interest
Swedbank AB (publ) is both the Bookrunner, Issuing Agent and Standby Facilitator for the Notes and a substantial

<<<

 lender to the Company. This may give rise to certain conflicts of interest.
Risk related to the security package
The Notes are secured by certain security relating to the Property. However, there is a risk that the value of the security will

<<<

 decrease significantly (as a result of e.g. a decrease in the value of the Property, the relevant tenant enters into financial difficulties or the relevant lease agreement is terminated), in which case any proceeds from enforcement of the security

<<<

 may not cover the full amount outstanding under the Notes.
Bankruptcy and similar events and risk of priority
The Company has, as part of its financing, incurred debts to credit institutions. Certain real estate and share certificates in the

<<<

 Company's real estate owning subsidiaries have in connection therewith been pledged as security. Such loans normally constitute a preferential claim on the Company. The Company intends to continue seeking financing in which case further pledges

<<<

, as part of such new loans, may be provided.
To the extent that the value of the security does not cover the amounts outstanding under the Notes, the Noteholders normally receive payment after any prioritised creditors in the event of the Company

<<<

's liquidation, company reorganisation or bankruptcy. Every investor should be aware that by investing in the Notes, it risks losing the entire, or parts of, its investment in the event of the Company's liquidation, bankruptcy or company reorganisation

<<<

.
Additional Mortgages
Pursuant to the Terms and Conditions, the Company shall grant security over Additional Mortgages in favour of the Noteholders, in the event that the Loan to Value exceeds 80%. Pursuant to the Swedish Bankruptcy Act (1

<<<

987:672) (the "Bankruptcy Act"), such delayed granting or perfection of security may be subject to a hardening period. Therefore, the security over the Additional Mortgages may be of no value to the Noteholders, should the Company become insolvent

<<<

 within certain time limits specified in the Bankruptcy Act after the granting or perfection of such security.
4

New or amended legislation
A change in the current tax legislation resulting in increased property tax or reduced possibilities

<<<

 for interest deductions would result in the Group facing an increased tax burden which could affect the Group's result and financial position.
New legislation or regulations or changes regarding the application of existing legislation or regulations

<<<

, which are applicable to the Company's operations or its clients or the Notes, may adversely affect the Company's business or an investment in the Notes.
Disputes and litigation
The Company may be or become involved in disputes or subject to

<<<

 other litigation now or in the future. In particular, the Company is subject to certain tax litigation where the Company is requested by the Swedish Tax Authority to pay additional taxes in significant amounts. A negative outcome of a dispute

<<<

 could adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.
Note-specific risks
Credit risk
Investors in the Notes are exposed to credit risk in relation to the Company. An investor's possibility to obtain

<<<

 payment in accordance with the Terms and Conditions is therefore dependent on the Company's ability to meet its payment obligations. The Company's financial position is affected by a number of factors, some of which have been described herein

<<<

. An increase in credit risk may also cause the market to price the Notes with a higher risk premium, which could adversely affect the value of the Notes.
Early redemption by request of the Company
In certain cases, the Company has pursuant

<<<

 to the Terms and Conditions the right to redeem the Notes prior to the Maturity Date. Such a right for the Company could affect the market value of the Notes. During a period when the Company is entitled to voluntarily redeem the Notes, the

<<<

 market value of the Notes will most likely not be significantly higher than the redemption price set out in the Terms and Conditions. Such effects could also arise prior to the actual redemption period.
The Company could exercise its right

<<<

 to early redemption of the Notes when the market value of the Notes is higher than the relevant redemption price, which could affect the investor's possibilities to re-invest the repaid amount on the same terms as the terms of the redeemed

<<<

 Notes.
Early redemption by request of the Noteholders
Upon the occurrence of certain events, the Company is obliged under the Terms and Conditions to, at the request of any Noteholder, mandatorily redeem the Notes held by such Noteholder at

<<<

 a price and on the terms set out in the Terms and Conditions. If this occurs, the Company will be exposed to an increased liquidity risk, i.e. the risk that the Company cannot fulfil its financial obligations due to a shortage of available

<<<

 cash or cash equivalent assets and that such financial obligations can only be fulfilled at a high financing cost or not at all. In such circumstances the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected

<<<

.
5

Secondary market and liquidity risk
Even if the Notes are to be listed on a regulated market such as NASDAQ OMX and available for trading on that market, there may not always be a demand for, and trade in, the Notes. This can result in

<<<

 investors being unable to sell their Notes at a desired time or to a return which is comparable to similar investments that have an existing and functioning secondary market. This lack of an efficient market place and a liquid secondary market

<<<

 may adversely affect the market value of the Notes.
Currency risks
The Company will pay interest and the principal amount of the Notes in SEK (the lawful currency in Sweden). This will incur currency exchange risks if the investor's operations

<<<

 are mainly conducted in a different currency. A currency exchange risk involves a risk for significant currency exchange rate movements, including devaluation and revaluation, as well as the risk for implementation or amendments to existing

<<<

 currency regulations. A strengthening of the investor's base currency compared to the currency in which the placement is denominated decreases the value of the placement for the investor. Governments and authorities can implement currency controls

<<<

 or currency regulations that will have an impact on the currency exchange rate. The result could be that a Noteholder receives a lower rate of return, final payment or nominal amount than expected.
Euroclear
The Notes are connected to Euroclear

<<<

's account-based system, which means that no physical notes have been or will be issued. Clearing and settlement relating to the Notes, as well as payment of interest and redemption of the principal amount of the Notes, will be performed within

<<<

 Euroclear's account-based system. The investors are therefore dependant on the functionality of Euroclear's account-based system.
Meeting of Noteholders
The Terms and Conditions include certain conditions regarding the Meeting of Noteholders

<<<

. Such meetings may be held in order to resolve matters relating to the Noteholders' interests under the Notes. The Terms and Conditions allow for stated majorities to bind all Noteholders, including Noteholders who have not participated in

<<<

 or voted at the actual meeting in question or who have voted differently than the required majority, to decisions that have been taken at a duly convened and conducted Meeting of Noteholders. Consequently, there is a risk that a Noteholder

<<<

 is bound by resolutions which negatively affect the value of the Notes even if the certain Noteholder did not vote in favour of such resolutions or did not participate in the Meeting of Noteholders.

Information about Fabege Company description The Company, Fabege AB (publ), with company registration number 556049-1523, was formed on 6 December 1946 in Sweden. Its trade name (i.e. the name used for marketing purposes

<<<

) is Fabege. The Company is a public limited liability company and is regulated by the Swedish Companies Act (Sw. aktiebolagslagen (2005:551)). The Company's shares are traded on NASDAQ OMX Stockholm with the ticker FABG. The registered office

<<<

 of the Company is in Stockholm and the Company's registered address is Box 730, 169 27 Solna, Sweden. In accordance with the Company's articles of association, adopted on 30 March 2011, the objects of the Company are to acquire, manage, improve

<<<

 and sell properties and conduct such other activities as are compatible therewith. Operations Fabege is a Swedish property company, focusing mainly on letting and managing office premises as well as property development. Fabege's business is

<<<

 highly concentrated to markets within the Stockholm region. The Fabege organisation supports the Company's business model, which is designed to create value regardless of the economic climate. The emphasis of the business model varies over

<<<

 time in response to changing market conditions, and the organisation is, therefore, structured to be flexible and adaptable. Fabege operates in three business areas, property management, property development and transaction.
Property management

<<<


Finding the right premises for a customer's specific requirements and ensuring that the customer is content is the essence of what Fabege does. The Company's approach is long-term and based on a close dialogue with the customer, which builds

<<<

 trust and loyalty on both sides. Active property management may also involve solving a large and complex move or helping a customer to find new premises in the Company's portfolio of properties. The business is divided into geographic areas

<<<

 where each sub-market is managed by a separate unit with a large degree of
11

individual responsibility and the ability to react swiftly to changes and identify new business opportunities.
The property management team has built a robust platform

<<<

 for Fabege's activities with a high occupancy rate and stable tenants. Responsibility for the operations and development as well as for contacts and relationship-building with its clients in the respective area rests with the area manager.

<<<

 Each area has operations managers, building maintenance technicians, and lettings specialists. Property Management also includes the Business Support department, which consists of a team with specialist expertise in the important area of environmental

<<<

 issues and energy consumption, as well as technology and purchasing.
Property development
Qualified development activities that add value to Fabege's properties constitute the second cornerstone of the Company's business. For Fabege, sustainable

<<<

 urban development entails the development of not only individual properties, but also areas and districts that will remain attractive long term.
The Company has expertise and experience from running property development projects, and strives

<<<

 to attract long-term tenants for properties that have not yet been fully developed and can be redesigned based on the customer's requirements. Fabege's project investments are forwardlooking and designed to improve the environmental characteristics

<<<

 of the properties and reduce vacancy rates, thereby improving cash flows and value growth.
The Company's properties are developed and improved in response to changing demand. Project plans are prepared for new builds, while properties with

<<<

 development potential are acquired, developed and then either transferred to the Group's investment portfolio or sold. New builds and more extensive development projects are always based on the principles of environmental building and energy

<<<

 requirements that comfortably fulfil the criteria for the EU GreenBuilding programme.
Projects aimed at adding value to land and buildings run over a longer period, often 10­15 years. In many cases, planning is initiated in partnership with

<<<

 the local authority in the area where the property or land is located. Together, visions are created for how to develop the area in the best way for the residents, for society as a whole and for Fabege as a company.
Transaction
Fabege's third

<<<

 cornerstone is business development, which focuses on transactions, analyses, valuations and portfolio and business development. Acquisitions and sales are a natural feature of what Fabege do.
The Company continuously analyses its portfolio

<<<

 to take advantage of opportunities to increase capital growth. Fabege aims to acquire properties with good growth potential, located within the Company's sub-markets. Fabege plan to sell the properties at the right time to realise accrued value

<<<

.
Location, condition and vacancies are key factors determining the growth potential of a property. A fully let property with modern and efficient premises but deemed to have limited potential for rent increases and capital growth could thus

<<<

 become a candidate for divestment, unless it forms a strategic part of a property cluster, for instance.
12

As a major player in a significant market, Fabege has built good relationships with local authorities and policy-makers. Fabege also

<<<

 has experience and knowledge of local markets, properties, development plans and other players.
Valuations of the properties are done by internal valuation experts as well as independent external valuation agencies. A model whereby all properties

<<<

, 25 per cent per quarter, are subject to external appraisal every quarter ensures a realistic market valuation of the property portfolio.
Trends
There has been no material adverse change in the prospects of the Company since the date of publication

<<<

 of its last audited financial report and no significant change in the financial or market position of the Group since 31 December 2012.
Legal structure
The Company is the parent company of the Group and had, as per 31 December 2012, five (

<<<

5) subsidiaries and, in total, the Group consisted of 194 companies. Almost all subsidiaries and subsubsidiaries were wholly-owned as of the same date. The Group holds most of its real estate through subsidiaries and sub-subsidiaries and is

<<<

 consequently dependent on such group companies for the generation of profits and cash flow and to service its payment obligations under the Notes.
Ownership structure
The table below sets forth the Company's ownership structure as of 28 February

<<<

 2013. As of that date, the Company had 43,388 shareholders.

If

<<<

 the relevant Fixed Interest Payment Date falls on a day that is not a Banking Day, that Fixed Interest Payment Date will instead fall on the first following Banking Day (following business day convention), subject to the Notes bearing interest

<<<

 only up to and including the Maturity Date.
Series 2: The interest on Series 2 Notes is equal to the Floating Interest Rate as determined on each Interest Determination Date with respect to the immediately following Interest Period and is payable

<<<

 on each Floating Interest Payment Date. The day count fraction in respect of the calculation of the payable interest amount shall be actual/360.
If the relevant Floating Interest Payment Date falls on a day that is not a Banking Day, that Floating

<<<

 Interest Payment Date will instead fall on the first following Banking Day, unless that day falls in the next calendar month, in which case that day will be the first preceding day that is a Banking Day (modified following business day convention

<<<

, adjusted), subject to the Notes bearing interest only up to and including the Maturity Date.
If the Interest Rate for an Interest Period cannot be calculated due to an obstacle set forth in Clause 22 (Limitations of Liability etc.) or other

<<<

 similar circumstance, the Interest Rate for the preceding Interest Period shall be applied. As soon as the obstacle has ceased, the Interest Rate shall be determined for the current Interest Period and applied from the second Banking Day after

<<<

 the day for determination up to including the next Interest Payment Date.
25

§4
NOTES IN BOOK-ENTRY FORM
The Notes shall be registered on Securities Accounts on behalf of the Noteholders and, therefore, no physical securities will be issued

<<<

Requests for certain registration measures regarding the Notes shall be directed to the Account Operator.
Any party which, on the basis of a mandate, pledge, the provisions of the Swedish Parental Code, terms and conditions of a will or deed

<<<

 of gift, or otherwise has acquired the right to receive payment pursuant to a Note must cause such right to be registered in order to receive payment.
§5
PURCHASE AND TRANSFER OF NOTES
The distribution of these Terms and Conditions and the

<<<

 offering, and sale of the Notes in certain jurisdictions may be restricted by law.
The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the US Securities Act and, subject to certain exceptions, may not be offered or sold within the United

<<<

 States. The Bookrunner has agreed that it will not offer or sell the Notes within the United States as part of its distribution at any time.
In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of the offering, an offer or sale of Notes within

<<<

 the United States by any dealer (whether or not participating in the offering) may violate the registration requirements of the US Securities Act.
§6
REDEMPTION OF NOTES AND PAYMENT OF INTEREST
The Nominal Amount of the Notes shall be due and

<<<

 payable on the Maturity Date.
Payment of the Nominal Amount and interest shall be made to a party that is a Noteholder on the fifth Banking Day prior to the respective due date or on the Banking Day closer to the respective due date which may

<<<

 generally be applied on the Swedish bond market (= Record Date).
Where a Noteholder, via the Account Operator, has requested that nominal amounts and interest shall be deposited on a particular bank account, the CSD shall cause such deposit

<<<

 to be made on the respective due date. In other cases, the CSD shall forward the sum on the above-stated date to the Noteholder at the address registered with the CSD on the Record Date. Where the due date is a day which is not a Banking Day

<<<

, the amount shall be deposited or forwarded on the following Banking Day and, in such circumstances, interest shall only accrue up to and including the original due date.
26

In the event that the CSD, as a consequence of delay by the Issuer

<<<

 or other impediments, is unable to make payment of amounts in accordance with the above provisions, such amounts shall be paid by the CSD to such party who is a Noteholder on the Record Date as soon as the cause for the impediment has terminated

<<<

.
In the event the Issuer is unable to perform its payment obligations through the CSD in accordance with the above provisions as a consequence of impediments encountered by the CSD as specified in Clause 22 (Limitation of liability etc.), the

<<<

 Issuer shall be entitled to postpone the payment obligation until such time as the impediment has been removed. In such circumstances, interest shall accrue in accordance with the second paragraph of Clause 9 (Default Interest) below.
In the

<<<

 event a party which has received amounts in accordance with the above provision is not entitled to receive such payment, the Issuer and the CSD shall be deemed to have performed their relevant obligations. The above-stated shall not apply,

<<<

 however, where the Issuer or the CSD was aware that the sum was improperly paid or where the Issuer or the CSD failed to exercise normal caution.
If both the Nominal Amount and interest are due for payment and if the available funds are insufficient

<<<

 to discharge all the amounts due and payable, the available funds shall first be applied towards payment of interest and secondly towards payment of the Nominal Amount.
The Issuer may not apply or perform any counterclaims or set-off against

<<<

 any payment obligations under these Terms and Conditions.
§7
EARLY REDEMPTION BY REQUEST OF THE NOTEHOLDERS
If an Early Redemption Event has occurred each Noteholder shall have the option to individually request that the Issuer redeem all or

<<<

 some of its Notes held by the relevant Noteholder (the "Relevant Notes") at a purchase price of 101 per cent. of the Nominal Amount of the Relevant Notes together with accrued interest within 60 days of being given notice (the "Put Option Period

<<<

") in accordance with Clause 16 (Notices) by the Issuer that an Early Redemption Event has occurred. Such request must be made in writing and addressed to the Agent in accordance with Clause 16 (Notices). Promptly after the expiry of the Put

<<<

 Option Period, the Agent shall notify the Issuing Agent of each such request, after which each relevant Noteholder's Notes shall be blocked from other transactions by the Issuing Agent. Redemption following such request shall fall 120 days

<<<

 after the notice of such Early Redemption Event is given by the Issuer.
An "Early Redemption Event" shall be deemed to have occurred, if, after the Issue Date, the Agent determines that any of the following events have occurred:
(a) the Vattenfall

<<<

 Lease Agreement is terminated (Sw. avtalet upphör);
(b) any person or group of persons, other than Brinova Fastigheter AB, acting in concert gains control of the Issuer; or

<<<

 appoint or remove all, or the majority, of the directors or other equivalent officers of the Issuer; or
 give directions with respect to the operating and financial policies

<<<

 of the Issuer which the directors or other equivalent officers of the Issuer are obliged to comply with; or
(ii) the holding of more than fifty per cent. (50%) of the issued share capital of the Issuer (excluding any part of that issued share

<<<

 capital that carries no right to participate beyond a specified amount in a distribution of either profits or capital).
"Acting in concert" means, a group of persons who, pursuant to an agreement or understanding (whether formal or informal

<<<

), actually co-operate, through the acquisition by any of them, either directly or indirectly, of shares in the Issuer, to obtain or consolidate control of the Issuer.

<<<

 two (2) months after the Issue Date or (b) following listing, the Issuer fails to maintain such listing in accordance with Clause 11 (General Covenants - Listing) (each a "Listing Event"), each Noteholder shall have the option to individually

<<<

 request, within thirty (30) Banking Days from the day of such failure (the "Notice Period"), that the Issuer redeem all or some of its Notes held by the relevant Noteholder (the "Redeemable Notes") at a purchase price of 100 per cent. of the

<<<

 day of the Meeting of Noteholders is available at the meeting. The chairman shall prepare a list of Noteholders present who are entitled to vote, with information regarding the share of the Voting Loan Amount represented by each Noteholder

<<<

 ("Voting Register"). Noteholders who have voted via electronic voting procedures, ballots or the equivalent shall, upon application of this provision, be deemed present at the Meeting of Noteholders. Only those persons who were Noteholders

<<<

 or representatives of such Noteholders on the fifth (5th) Banking Day prior to the date of the Meeting of Noteholders and who are included in the Voting Loan Amount shall be entitled to vote and shall be included in the Voting Register. The

<<<

 Voting Register shall thereafter be approved by the Meeting of Noteholders.
Minutes of the Meeting of Noteholders shall be kept, recording the day and time of the meeting, attendees, matters discussed, results of voting, and resolutions which

<<<

 were adopted. The Voting Register shall be recorded in, or appended to, the minutes. The minutes shall be signed by the keeper of the minutes. They shall be attested by the chairman if the chairman has not kept the minutes, as well as by one

<<<

 of the persons appointed by the Meeting of Noteholders to attest the minutes. The minutes shall thereafter be submitted to the Agent. The minutes shall be sent to the Noteholders pursuant to Clause 16 (Notices) no later than ten Banking Days

<<<

 after the Meeting of Noteholders. New or amended Terms and Conditions shall be appended to the minutes and sent to the CSD through the Agent or another party designated by the Agent. The minutes shall be stored in a secure manner by the Agent

<<<

.
The Agent shall count the results of voting received for a Written Procedure and keep minutes in respect of the result of the Written Procedure. The Agent may, without having an obligation to, request supplements and clarifications with respect

<<<

 to the votes received. The Agent may disregard any votes that are unclear or illegible. The Agent may furthermore disregard votes that do not correspond with the provided voting alternatives or in the event the voting right of a Noteholder

<<<

 is
43

not evidenced by the documents provided by that Noteholder. The Issuer has a right to participate when the results of the voting is counted. Minutes of the Written Procedure shall be produced as soon as possible and be held available

<<<

 to the Noteholders by the Issuer and the Agent.
A Meeting is quorate where Noteholders representing not less than one-fifth (20%) of the Voting Loan Amount are present at the Meeting.
However, for the following types of matters, attendance

<<<

 (or with respect to a Written Procedure, votes) of Noteholders representing not less than three quarters (75%) of the Voting Loan Amount at the Meeting is necessary ("Extraordinary Resolution"):
(a) approval of an agreement with the Issuer

<<<

 or a third party regarding change of the Maturity Date, reduction of the loan amount, change of the designated currency for the Notes (unless this is subject to operation of law) and change of the applicable Interest Payment Dates, interest

<<<

 rate or other interest terms and conditions;
(b) approval of a change of debtor;
(c) change of Agent in accordance with Clause 18 (Change of Agent), and
(d) approval of an amendment of this Clause.
If a Meeting of Noteholders is convened and

<<<

 the necessary share of the Voting Loan Amount represented by Noteholders necessary for the meeting to be quorate has not been reached within thirty (30) minutes from the time scheduled for the Meeting of Noteholders, or with respect to a Written

<<<

 Procedure, the necessary votes have not been obtained by the Agent at the end of the scheduled time for filing of votes, the meeting shall be adjourned (and with respect to a Written Procedure, the time for filing of votes be prolonged) until

<<<

 the day which falls one week later (or, if such day is a not a Banking Day, the following Banking Day). If the Meeting is quorate for some, but not all, issues which are to be resolved upon at the meeting, the meeting shall be adjourned (or

<<<

 the time for filing of votes prolonged) after resolutions have been adopted on matters for which the meeting was quorate. Notice that a Meeting has been adjourned (or the time for filing of votes prolonged) and information regarding the time

<<<

 and place of the continued Meeting shall be sent to the Noteholders as soon as possible by the Agent through the agency of the CSD. When an adjourned (or prolonged) Meeting is resumed, the Meeting shall be entitled to adopt resolutions, including

<<<

 Extraordinary Resolutions, if Noteholders representing not less than one-tenth (10%) of the Voting Loan Amount as per the printout of the register of Noteholders which was presented in accordance with the above stated (taking into consideration

<<<

 what is stated below regarding nominees) are present at the meeting (or with respect to a Written Procedure, filed votes). The resumed Meeting shall commence with the preparation of a new voting register by the chairman (on the same principles

<<<

 as set forth above and based on the aforementioned printout of the register of Noteholders). Only Noteholders who are listed in such new voting register shall be entitled to vote at the meeting. A Meeting cannot be adjourned more than once

<<<

.
Resolutions of a Meeting of Noteholders are adopted by means of a poll vote if any Noteholder so requests. Each Noteholder entitled to vote shall, in conjunction with voting, have one vote per Note (which constitutes a share of all outstanding

<<<

 Notes) which he holds.
44

Extraordinary Resolutions are valid only if they are supported by not less than three quarters (75%) of the votes cast. For all other resolutions, the position which receives more than half (50%) of the votes cast

<<<

 shall prevail. For the avoidance of doubt, no Group Company shall be entitled to vote for any Notes held by it.
Upon application of this Clause, holders of nominee-registered Notes shall be regarded as Noteholders instead of the nominee if

<<<

 the holder presents a certificate from the nominee showing that as of the fifth (5th) Banking Day prior to a Meeting, the person in question was the holder of a Note and stating the size of such person's holding. Managers of nominee-registered

<<<

 Notes shall be deemed present at the Meeting for the number of Notes which the manager has been instructed to represent.
Resolutions adopted at a duly convened and executed Meeting are binding on all Noteholders regardless of whether they were

<<<

 present, and regardless of whether, and how, they have voted at the Meeting. Noteholders who voted in favour of resolutions adopted at the Meeting of Noteholders cannot be held liable for any loss incurred by any other Noteholder as a result

<<<

 of such resolution.
All reasonable expenses of the Agent, the Issuing Agent and the CSD in conjunction with a Meeting shall be defrayed by the Issuer.
A request to convene a Meeting must be submitted to the Agent at the address stated in Clause

<<<

 16 (Notices). Such correspondence must state whether the business is urgent.
§ 20
NOMINEE REGISTRATION
Other than as explicitly stated below, with respect to Notes which are nominee registered pursuant to the Swedish Financial Instruments 

<<<

<<<

<<<

<<<

<<<

§ 22 LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY ETC. The Agent, the Issuing Agent and CSD shall have no liability

<<<

 for damage caused by Swedish or foreign enactment, action taken by a Swedish or foreign authority, war, strike, blockade, boycott, lockout or other similar circumstance. This limitation of liability in the case of a strike, blockade, boycott

<<<

 out of other circumstances, unless the person in question has been grossly negligent. None of the Agent, the Issuing Agent or CSD shall under any circumstances be liable for indirect damages. The provisions in this Section 22 shall not apply

<<<

 to the extent the provisions are inconsistent with the provisions of the Swedish Financial Instruments Accounts Act (SFS 1998:1479).
46

§ 23 APPLICABLE LAW, JURISDICTION The laws of Sweden shall apply to the interpretation and application

<<<

 of these Terms and Conditions. Disputes regarding these Terms and Conditions shall be resolved, in the first instance, by the City Court of Stockholm.
