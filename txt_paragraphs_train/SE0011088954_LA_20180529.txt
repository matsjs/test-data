<<<

 when necessary, financial statements published before the Issue Date) shall be used for the Incurrence Test and the Maintenance Test, but adjusted by (without double counting):

(a) including the operating profit before interest, tax, depreciation

<<<

, amortisation and impairment charges (calculated on the same basis as EBITDA) of Group Company (or attributable to a business or assets) acquired during the Reference Period for that part of the Reference Period prior to its becoming Group

<<<

 after the last day of the Reference Period and the amount of the Restricted Payment in respect of which the Incurrence Test is made.

12.3.2

The figures for Net Interest Bearing Debt for the Reference Period ending on the last day of the period

<<<

 covered by the most recent Financial Report (including when necessary, financial statements published before the Issue Date) shall be used for the Incurrence Test and the Maintenance Test, but adjusted so that Net Interest Bearing Debt shall

<<<

 be (without double counting):

17

(a) reduced to reflect any Financial Indebtedness attributable to a disposal of an entity or which has been repaid, repurchased or otherwise discharged as a result of or in connection with a disposal of an

<<<

 entity (to the extent such Financial Indebtedness is included in the relevant financial statements), in each case to the extent attributable to the Reference Period;
(b) increased on a pro forma basis by an amount equal to the Financial Indebtedness

<<<

 directly attributable to (i) any Financial Indebtedness owed by acquired entities, and (ii) any Financial Indebtedness incurred to finance the acquisition of such entities, in each case to the extent attributable to the Reference Period or

<<<

 the period from the end of the Reference Period to the relevant testing date (for the avoidance of doubt, any cash balance resulting from the incurrence of the Financial Indebtedness shall not reduce Net Interest Bearing Debt); and
(c) increased

<<<

 on a pro forma basis by an amount equal to the Financial Indebtedness (the incurrence of which requires that the Incurrence Test is made) incurred after the last day of the Reference Period and the amount equal to the Financial Indebtedness

<<<

 in respect of which the Incurrence Test is made (for the avoidance of doubt, any cash balance resulting from the incurrence of the new Financial Indebtedness shall not reduce Net Interest Bearing Debt).
12.4 Equity Cure
(a) Subject to paragraphs

<<<

 (an "Equity Cure").
(b) The full cash amount of the Equity Cure shall be deemed to have been applied as an increase of EBITDA as at the relevant Reference Date in respect of which the Leverage Ratio Maintenance Test is made, whereupon the Leverage

<<<

 Ratio Maintenance Test shall be recalculated to include the effect of the Equity Cure. Provided that the amount of the Equity Cure contributed to the Issuer is sufficient to prevent the breach of the Leverage Ratio Maintenance Test, no Event

<<<

 of Default shall be deemed to have occurred.
(c) The Equity Cure must be made within twenty (20) Business Days of delivery of a Compliance Certificate evidencing the breach ofthe Leverage Ratio Maintenance Test.
(d) The Equity Cure shall be

<<<

 deemed to have been received on the Reference Date falling on last day of the Reference Period and shall be included in the calculation of the Leverage Ratio Maintenance Test until such time as that Reference Date falls outside the Reference

<<<

 Period.
(e) Any Equity Cure must be contributed in cash to the Issuer and no more than three (3) Equity Cures may be made over the lifetime of the Bonds. Equity Cures may not be injected in respect of any consecutive calendar quarters.
(f)

<<<

 For the avoidance of doubt, Net Interest Bearing Debt shall not be reduced by any amount of the Equity Cure.
